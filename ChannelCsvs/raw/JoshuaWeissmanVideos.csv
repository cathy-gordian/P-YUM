FOLLOW...",2022-11-27 21:59:44.385768, I've spent tens of thousands of hours cooking professionally in restaurants so yeah I'm a big critic of food but there's an even bigger more brutally honest more unfiltered critic out there children what's the verdict [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] in my childhood I had to have a meal didn't like it but I know it's a nostalgic Staple in fast food culture probably the easiest thing for a parent you don't need to cook if she gets a toy everybody's happy kids love it but maybe it's not what you remember anymore it can be much much better but I'm not the judge of that they are I don't know how this is gonna go because I've never cooked for children before but regardless we have a very special surprise for them and I know it's going to change their minds now let's make this shall we oh my goodness welcome to the Playboy yeah time for a Happy Meal to make me feel young again we're at McDonald's we've done the three-point test here before I mean if I were to reanalyze it I'll give it the same score I don't know what it was building five out of ten all in all very sweet give that one to route back to the menu rating we have two out of ten that's what it was are they gonna still give you my happy meal even though it's breakfast time oh my God it's 10 59. we have to get up there only at 11. [Music] yeah hi can I just get Happy Meal Yes Men these are actually kind of amazing I'm with animations on it I'm Gonna Bump the appearance up by one point she was really nice also I'm also gonna bump that up maybe because she thought that I had kids in the car but little did she know thank you so much I appreciate it she was really nice and had an Angelic smile I'm gonna give this McDonald's an 8 out of 10 all around okay let's go we got the bag we have two options the burger and the Nugget they didn't ask us if we wanted a boy or a girl toy very Progressive wow oh my goodness that's dumb moving on it's the same toy you all right apples how long have these been in this bag this looks like Shrek's shaved toe single-handedly the most flavorless Apple I've ever eaten will be gone [Music] how many fries are in here one two thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen fries remember they're being better they didn't sell these at all time for our chicken nuggets we've had these before somehow worse than I remember but they're decent I've come to understand why people like these they're also not that great burger here's the thing like if I had children I care about them nobody deserves that bon appetit I don't have anything to say about that I get it it's not an artisanal meal that's why I'm not the judge today kids will be the judge of this one and we're still gonna win we're hitting every angle with this we're doing the chicken nuggets and the hamburger and I know what you're thinking oh my God Josh is finally doing the McDonald's fry listen this is a good fry recipe but our real McDonald's french fry butt better is coming soon now let's talk burger buns first you're gonna make a tengzon in a small pot you're gonna add two tablespoons or 30 milliliters of water a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of whole milk and then whisk in two tablespoons or 18 grams of all-purpose flour till dissolved instead of our medium heat and continuously stir until that thickens into a nice gloop like this unless they cool completely separately in the bowl of a stand mixer you're gonna add three Dove cups or 525 grams of bread flour two tablespoons or 28 grams of granulated sugar half a teaspoon or 2 grams of Amy lace fall that with one and a half teaspoons or nine grams of fine sea salt and whisk all that together now in a separate container you're gonna add half a cup or 120 grams of whole milk and half a cup plus two tablespoons or 143 grams of water heat that at 95 degrees Fahrenheit and whisk in two and a half teaspoons or 14 grams of instant yeast till dissolved then beat in one whole egg and one egg yolk your stand mixer dough spiral got your flour set it to medium low speed pour in your yeasty juice followed by your cool Tang Zhong once you get a relatively smooth dough about two to three minutes add in three Dove tablespoons or 50 grams of softened unsalted butter and once you have a smooth Supple dough it's done we'll do a light bulb Place into a grease bowl and let it rise for one hour at room temperature or until dueled in size punch your dough down divide it into pieces that weigh around 60 grams each roll those into doit balls and place them to grease parchment paper evenly spaced apart cover with grease plastic wrap and proof for 30 minutes then you make a little egg wash consisting of one egg plus one tablespoon of water whisked together brush each of your little bowls and bake in a sweltering 375 degree oven for about 15 minutes brush each bun with melted butter and they're done all those are cooling let's make our nuggets now you can do this with a meat grinder or the food processor frisket one and a half pounds or 680 grams of bulbous skinless chicken breast cut that into strips that are thin enough to fit in your grinder Flow by a third pound or 136 grams of pork fat back these are gonna be bone dry if you don't use fat now cut that into small pieces and send that brother to heaven right through your meat grinder until all of it is ground evenly once you have your nugget paste season it with one and three quarters of a teaspoon or six grams of fine sea salt optionally one teaspoon or three grams of MSG one and a half teaspoons or 7 grams of granulated sugar and mix that all together until thoroughly combined now look this is really easy you shape the Nuggets into ovals that are about one and a quarter inch long and just under half an inch thick that'll get you about 32 total nuggets now place this under a grease quarter sheet with parchment and pop in the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes or until still now we prep our fries first you'll need two pounds or 907 grams of russet potatoes and you're just gonna cut those into French fry matchsticks now place this into a large bowl season very generously with salt and add enough water to cover the fries toss them and soak them for about 15 minutes then drain the water place those on a sheet tray with paper towels and dry as much as possible then get a 7 quart heavy bottom pot fill it about halfway with vegetable oil and heat that bad boy to 300 degrees Fahrenheit then in batches you're gonna fry your potatoes for about two to four minutes or until just barely cooked through they should have zero color drain them of their oil and repeat with the rest now once all those are par fried gonna pop those onto sheet trays and place in the freezer to freeze until solid now if you're serving apples with this obviously a nice fresh Fiji apple is my ideal Choice which you'll peel and slice in slices we're gonna make a very easy caramel medium sauce pot add one cup or 200 grams of granulated sugar and a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of water mix that together until set that to medium high and let that boil until it turns a nice amber color reduce the heat to medium whisk in five and a half tablespoons or 77 grams of unsalted butter once that's melted and emulsified cut off the heat and whisk in half a cup or 120 milliliters of heavy cream and finally one teaspoon or 4 grams of vanilla extract whisk let it cool completely and that's your caramel you can drizzle this on your apples or you can put it on the side okay the moment is here now the Nuggets will sit the best so we'll start with those first we have a thin batter consisting of a quarter cup or 33 grams of corn starch 1 cup or 240 milliliters of water and then whisk together until it looks like milk second is our flour mix medium sized Bowl three cups are 450 grams of all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon or 22 grams of kosher salt half a teaspoon or two grams of one teaspoon or 3 grams of ground white pepper one teaspoon of 2 grams of celery powder then whisk together till combined last but not least is essentially a tempura batter medium sized bowl half a cup or 75 grams of cornstarch three quarters of a cup or 103 grams of all-purpose flour one and a quarter teaspoon of 4 grams of baking powder and a quarter teaspoon or one gram of baking soda whisk together till combined fall that with one cup or 240 milliliters of chilled water 2 eggs and then whisk until you get a smooth batter like this we got your fryer set up from earlier real simple all right increase the heat to 350 Fahrenheit and for each nugget first a dip in the cornstarch batter followed by the flour mix shake out the excess flour and pay attention here swiftly dunk into the tempura batter to fully coat and quickly transfer to the oil being careful of the splash rinse and repeat with all of your nuggets in three total batches let those fry for three to four minutes or until golden brown and the inside is obviously not medium rare pull it out and drain on a wire rack absolutely seasoned very lightly with additional salt to taste and that's your monkeys it's Burger time our sauce will consists of half a cup or 120 grams of mayonnaise three quarters of a cup or 176 grams of ketchup half a cup or 120 grams of yellow mustard and optionally but recommended a little sprinkling to taste with mushroom soup based powder stir together until combined and well that's it look it's really easy it's a smash Patty you'll need one pound or 450 grams of ground beef now divide that into about one inch thick balls get yourself a pan grease it up place over medium high and once that's ripping hot place the ball down press it until it's about an eighth of an inch thick season with salt and pepper let that sear for about a minute or two then once it's crisp on the bottom flip season the top of salt and pepper and add one slice of yes American cheese get a bun you cut it in half toasted in butter in a pan on both sides sauce your bottom bun lay on your hot cheesy burger sauce your top bun four slices of pickles and Crown your king everything is done except the Flies your oil temperature should be at around 375 fahrenheit directly from Frozen in batches add in your frozen french fries that you prepped earlier and Fry once more for two to four minutes or until beautifully crisp and stiff like this right here drain on a wire rack and season it takes with salt immediately look at this incredible Happy Meal we have in front of us now the taste test this time is gonna be

Thanksgiving looks like your ideal most perfect most amazing Thanksgiving what is that and after a few years I think it's time [Music] we've done Thanksgiving and holidays many ways cheapest fastest easiest whatever I've got on my Instagram and I keep asking well what do you want to see for Thanksgiving but I appreciate your responses I appreciate you connecting with me yes I read my DMs but at the end of the day this is not about the fanciest meal or anything like that it's about how I would make mine so you can stop asking the question and let's make this shall we this isn't just my ideal Thanksgiving it's an unforgettable one we have the greatest gravy plenty of vegetables the softest most voluptuous buns little salad to keep it healthy yes we did cranberry sauce with champagne now listen up we have to start with the pie because you do not want to be making pie the day of Thanksgiving ever so here's what you do you can use your favorite pie crust if you already have one but if you don't get a food processor and to that you'll add one and a quarter cup or 187 grams of all-purpose flour one teaspoon or six grams of fine sea salt let's add it together token mind then add half a cup or 113 grams of cold unsalted butter cut into small cubes pulse out a few times until get some rough pea-sized balls in there dumb window medium sized bowl and then add four tablespoons or 60 grams of ice cold water while constantly stirring with a fork and my recommendation would be to go a tablespoon of water at a time once you get a roughed out dump it on a work surface lightly needed to get a very very rough dough wrap that dough in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 15 minutes now roll the dough into a 13 inch wide Circle transfer that to a 9 inch deep dish pie pan adhere the dirt of the pan cut the excess crimp the edges cover the crust with parchment paper and add rice or dried beans to weigh it down and place it into an oven that's been preheated to 400 Fahrenheit and bake for 20 minutes until pale and partially cooked now remove reduce the oven temperature to 350 Fahrenheit and we make the filling first small saucepan add in six tablespoons or 85 grams of unsalted butter heat over medium and let it melt and cook swirling occasionally for three to five minutes or until you get a beautiful brown butter now add your brown butter to a bowl then add three quarters of a cup or 135 grams of dark brown sugar three quarters of a cup or 240 grams of light corn syrup and this is a little secret of mine a third cup or 120 grams of Lyles golden syrup one vanilla bean pod worth of beans and half a teaspoon or 2 grams of fine sea salt then whisk in three whole eggs one egg yolk two and a half tablespoons or 32 grams of high proof bourbon whisk and tilt early combined sprinkle your pecans over the baked pie crust and pour the sugar mixture over these nuts if you want to look a nice slip over any pecans that have capsized and pop into a 350 degree oven for 50 to 55 minutes remove from the oven and cool completely now look ideally I'd recommend chilling in the fridge for a minimum of four hours but overnight is usually the answer then you slice and serve with ice cream on top and everybody will give you a little kiss if you want pumpkin pie I already have a recipe for that link in the description but let's talk about the main event the turkey and it's unlike anything you've ever seen sure you could do it whole like this but what if you could turn an entire turkey into one solid piece with no bones almost like a porchetta we're gonna debone this entire turkey but leave it in one solid piece we'll be using a Ballentine method but for the whole bird first off a dress your turkey little spank with the back facing up cut along one side of the spine working your way down you will need a very sharp knife for this okay as it starts to strip away keeping your knife against the bone constantly start stripping away the leg and then you're like oh wait a minute there's a bone in the way fiddle your knife around find The Joint cut that the leg gets loose then work your way back to the top do the exact same thing with the wing disjoint it and it should fall loose keep cutting that down again don't leave any meat on the bone keep your knife against the bone once you're just about to get to the tip of the breastbone stop there and repeat the exact same process on the other side trim trim trim break down the leg then the wing very nice at this point the entire cavity is exposed then you just carefully Whittle your knife around cut and remove the cavity look at that now our little friend is a little flat next we remove the leg bones there's two bones hidden in there you see that fat line on the thigh that's going to guide you to roughly where the bone is fiddle around with your finger you'll feel that bone and cut along the length of that whole bone to reveal it and just grip away the excess meat until the bone is fully revealed then work your knife underneath that bone and cut away from the thigh to fully release the thigh bone you'll essentially do the same thing to the other side of the bone that runs through the drumstick run your knife along the whole drumstick reveal that bone completely run your knife under cut away and release then work your way down to where it's connected and once there's nothing but a wee bit of a little meat connecting it oh so gentle slice and free your bone now make sure you didn't leave any cartilage behind repeat the same on the other side for the wings you can remove the flats and it's the same concept as the thighs cut along the bone expose it carefully fiddle it out find the cartilage and remove once that's all done gonna notice some tendons still attached to where the drumstick was using pliers remove each and every little tendon this is very important to the tenderness of your turkey now at this point every single bone in this turkey has been removed it's extremely flat and it looks a little weird I'll be honest kind of Jiggles funny now onto the filling First Take Five garlic cloves place them in a small pot add just enough vegetable oil to cover place over medium heat and let that cook for about three to four minutes or until incredibly soft and light golden brown let those cool completely drain and let those cool get five more garlic cloves smash with the flat side of your knife and then begin shopping together once a rough chopped add your coffee garlic and chop together as finely as possible now at that point you'll have three anchovy fillets chopped together until it's fine and pastified as possible add that to a bowl and add in seven Sage leaves finely chopped one tablespoon or five grams of finely chopped thyme half a cup of 12 grams of Italian flat leaf parsley finely chopped a quarter cup or 25 grams of finely grated parmigiano reggiano one teaspoon or two grams of fennel powder one teaspoon or two grams of finely ground black pepper salted taste mixed together then add and a quarter cup or 50 grams of extra virgin olive oil mixed together and you should have a beautiful paste now spread your paste all over your deflated turkey season a taste of salt and pepper now look this is the harder part roll the turkey up as tightly as you can my recommendation is make sure to roll legs and thighs to breast then using kitchen twine tied together at multiple intervals across the entire roast and you'll end up with a relatively cylindrical lock now if you want it more cylindrical you can wrap it in plastic around put it in the fridge we didn't have time for that and it's totally fine if you don't now that your turkey's prepped let's make our buns AKA Hokkaido Parker House rolls this is a bit of a riff off the buns in my cookbook with a couple things change now first we'll start with the Tang Song small sauce pan add in a quarter cup or 60 grams of whole milk 2 tablespoons or 27 grams of water then whisk in two tablespoons or 20 grams of all-purpose flour place that on the stove over medium heat and continuously stir until it gets Thicker Than a Snicker now let that cool then separately half a cup or 120 grams of water mix together half a cup or 120 grams of milk heat to 90 degrees Fahrenheit then add two and a half teaspoons or 10 grams of instant yeast whisk together until it dissolved then add one whole egg and one egg yolk whisk together until combined now full of a stand mixer four cups or 62 grams of all-purpose flour a third of a cup or 72 grams of granulated sugar yes a lot trust me here one and three quarters of a teaspoon or 11 grams of fine sea salt 3 grams of amylase mix it together mine pop on your stand mixer set to medium low while stirring add your yeasty eggy milkies followed by your cooled Ting Zong and let them mix until you get a relatively smooth dough about two to three minutes then add in half a cup or 113 grams of softened unsalted butter let that mix for five minutes and you should have a beautifully smooth Supple dough if it's too runny then add extra flour about a tablespoon at a time until it's workable but don't add too much now roll your dough into a ball Place into a grease Bowl cover with plastic wrap and rise for one and a half to two hours or until plump this Rising portion can be done overnight in the refrigerator yay now once it's risen Degas your dough by punching all the yeasty farts out of it and then toss into a lightly floured counter separate that into 16 even pieces weighing around 69 grams each nice roll each piece in the toy balls and place into a grease 9x9 baking pan evenly spaced apart in rows of four cover that with greased plastic wrap and proof at room temp for 20 to 40 minutes or until doubled in plump brush with an egg wash consisting of one egg plus one teaspoon of water beating together and bake at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for 17 to 20 minutes or until beautifully golden brown and a toothpick piercing the center comes out clean while that's baking you should make the following you see this beautiful golden shimmering liquid garlic butter small sauce pot add in half a cup or 113 grams of salted butter anyway place that on a medium heat as that's melting add a generous pinch of MSG now once that's completely melted cut off the heat and add in two cloves of very finely chopped garlic now once your hot rolls emerge from the oven brush generously with your garlic butter if you use all of it I promise ain't nobody gonna be complaining and then just let those cool now let's talk about our potatoes we're gonna make the finest mashed potatoes you have ever seen and guess what it only takes four ingredients potatoes butter milk salt that's it now start with four pounds or 1.8 kilos of small Yukon Gold potatoes the smaller the better clean them off and place all those into a large pot of water bring to a boil and cook just until soft about 35 to 40 minutes once your potatoes are soft remove them from the pot and immediately peel your potatoes either using a small paring knife be careful or peeling with your bare hands if you don't have asbestos hands that's okay now cut your potatoes into rough chunks and pass through a food mill then place on a stove over medium low you're gonna add gradually two cups or 448 grams of cold cubed unsalted butter we're gonna add it in three to four parts so first add a quarter of your butter stir that in until melted another quarter is Turtle melted see where I'm going here once all of your butter is added and it's getting nice and smooth and Luscious you're then going to add a quarter cup to a half cup or around 70 to 180 milliliters of warm whole milk whisk that in aggressively be sure to check it for consistency if it's a nice consistency now then don't add any more milk if it needs more then add more it depends on the starch level of your potatoes season that generously with salted taste mixed together and obviously you can pass this through Tammy if you want an ultra smooth but it already is beautiful I mean look at this I'll tell you right now these might be the greatest potatoes you ever taste in your entire life it is what it is now just keep those bad boys warm moving on to a guanciale cornbread stuffing first you'll need about 12 cups of cubed cornbread you know do your best it doesn't have to be perfect this doesn't do a large bowl toss with about three tablespoons of vegetable oil you know just enough to lightly coat it pop onto a sheet tray and bake at 350 Fahrenheit for about 20 to 30 minutes or until dried out and lightly golden brown think sort of Crouton Vibes now in a large pan add six ounces of one Chalet and cook over medium low heat till the fat starts to render increase to medium and cook till crisp and browned then add in two rough chopped stalks of celery one diced yellow onion and five cloves of thinly sliced garlic season to taste of salt add in half a cup or 120 grams of unsalted butter and saute until just softened now separately in a sauce pot you're gonna add two and a half to three cups or 600 to 720 milliliters of chicken stock a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of shiridashi and 10 leaves of sage finely chopped heat that just until steamy hot should smell lovely add your cornbread croutons to a large bowl followed by your guanciale mix your broth two eggs and toss together until thoroughly hydrated if you need to add extra melted butter hey I'm not stopping you pop it into a 9x13 baking pan and bake at 350 Fahrenheit cover with oil for 30 to 40 minutes wait Josh that's not an oven that is correct now moving on to the rest of our sides first a very easy Caesar it's more traditional to do by chopping at all but we're gonna make it fast blender to that you'll add one tablespoon or 18 grams of Dijon mustard five cloves of garlic four anchovy fillets the juice of one lemon and half a cup or 50 grams of finely grated parmigiano reggiano and two egg yolks two tablespoons of water now blend that on medium then increase to high once you get a nice smooth paste you're gonna drizzle in one and a quarter cup or 300 grams of vegetable oil you should use all your vegetable oil so if it gets too thick add more then add just a tiny splash of water to loosen until you've added all of your vegetable oil take it out place it in a bowl season with additional salt and black pepper to taste and that's your dressing that's it it's really easy the greens will literally just be two heads of Romaine rough chopped and two heads of butter lettuce just carefully separated croutons are really easy you can buy them if you want but I'll tell you right now I haven't bought croutons in like my entire life just take a local crusty bread cut it into a cubes as big or as small as you want place in a large bowl generously cooked with olive oil and some flaky salt to taste toss together place on our baking sheet and bake at 350 until crisp golden brown and I mean come on you know how to serve a salad you put the leaves in the bowl put in your croutons before before you add any dressing to anything ever always add additional salt and potential lemon juice to taste then add your dressing and toss I promise you it is the key to making the greatest salad of your life no matter what a little extra salt in many cases makes it better now for a nice waitaki mushroom with chimichurri you're gonna need two pounds or 90 grams of maitaki mushrooms cut them into three quarter inch thick slices sort of like this get a large pan add just a vegetable oil to coat the bottom once it's ripping hot at medium high add in your mushrooms in one single layer season it takes with salt to taste and add something on top to weigh it down sear it for about two minutes and sear on the other side once they're tender remove and repeat with the rest chimney is basic small bowl two red Fresno chilies finely chopped half a cup or 12 grams of finely chopped parsley three cloves of grated garlic half a cup of 120 milliliters of extra virgin olive oil the juice from one lemon salt to taste and stir together it's not a traditional chimichurri but there's a vibe to it you put the mushrooms on a plate you cover them with the sauce very very easy you can also add some additional lemon zest on top if you want to be a little zesty onto a luxurious yet simple cranberry sauce first medium saucepan at 12 ounces or 340 grams of Frozen or fresh cranberries followed by one and a half cups or 300 grams of sugar 1 cup or 260 milliliters of orange juice and one cup or 260 milliliters of a nice quality champagne it doesn't have to be the most expensive but get something decent the flavor of the champagne matters bring it to a boil and boil for 10 to 15 minutes or until reduced and the sauce is thickened pop into a blender and blend until as smooth as physically possible pass through fine mesh strainer cool completely and that's your cranberries next honey gochujang carrots you're gonna need four pounds or 1800 grams of carrots pop into a large bowl add half a cup of 170 grams of Honey three tablespoons or 50 grams of gochujang one teaspoon of 4 grams of Brown Ginger foreclose the garlic finely chopped a third cup or 75 grams of butter melted mix together pour over your carrots salt and pepper to taste toss it until thoroughly combined pop into a baking sheet and bake it for 25 Fahrenheit for 20 to 25 minutes or until lightly caramelized and cooked through to your liking now while it's baking we're going to make a quick Curry Fried shallot take four shallots cut them about an eighth of an inch thick I would recommend using a mandolin so that they're evenly sized if they're not then they're not going to fry evenly now add 3 cups or 720 milliliters of vegetable oil now this shouldn't go past halfway up so if it's past halfway up you need a larger pot and set over medium-high heat while constantly stirring that you're gonna be in a fry they're going to sizzle do all their little thing once that bubbling starts to die down and they're teetering towards golden brown remove drain on paper towels then immediately season your taste with salt and a curry powder of your choice toss together and those are your shallots now to serve these it's very basic they go on our serving tray and you can add as many of your crispy shallots or as little as you want I like a little on the side but hey throw it on people are going lucky now once you're around two hours from serving your food dedicate the oven to your turkey get it heated to 475 Fahrenheit Pat your turkey skin completely dry give it a little rub with some extra virgin olive oil just enough to coat the outside season it takes the Salt and Pepper pop it in your oven for 15 minutes then reduce the heat to 325 and cook for one to one and a half hours or until the internal temperature is 155 degrees Fahrenheit pull it out and let it rest for 25 minutes now while all that's going on you got a few more things to make first off the gravy this can also be made a day ahead but it also doesn't take that long get a medium saucepan add two and a half cups or 600 milliliters of chicken or turkey stock half a cup or 120 milliliters of shirodashi 10 dried shiitake mushrooms a quarter cup or two grams of Bonito flakes heat over medium high tilt very hot and steamy cut off the heat and steep for 10 minutes pass that through a sieve and wring out your mushrooms now in a separate pot add a quarter cup of 57 grams of unsalted butter heat over medium heat once that's melted and boom boom add in a quarter cup or 37 grams of all-purpose flour and cook for about 30 seconds then add in all of your liquid stir until thickened cut off the heat and a little tiny pinch of MSG insulted taste and add three cloves of very finely chopped garlic and three sprigs of Rosemary that's been lightly bruised by hand whisk sleep for 5 to 10 more minutes and pass one last time through a sieve this gravy will make you say good Lord have mercy now let's talk about these brussels sprouts nobody likes them right if you make them like this no one will be immune for stealing about one pound or 450 grams of gruyere cheese grated pop that into a blender and then separately you have three cups or 720 milliliters of heavy cream until steamy hot pour that into your blender along with a little salted taste cover and blend it on high until as smooth as possible pour that into an whipped cream canister tie the lid on tight add one charger screw it on give it a nice shake and you have a gruyere foam now for the Sprouts themselves you'll need about two to three pounds of Brussels sprouts cut in half or quarter depending on their size and then you're simply just getting a large pot filled with vegetable oil about halfway heated 350 Fahrenheit and fry your brussels sprouts in batches until crispy and golden brown like these don't try to fry all these brussels sprouts at once do it in several batches and it'll be up three to four minutes per batch now all those are frying we're gonna make a simple apple Castle patrono Olive relish medium Bowl one to two green apples depending on their size Slice on a mandolin and then finely dice followed by three quarters of a cup or 102 grams of rough chopped pitted Castle matrona olives three quarters of a cup or 102 grams of crushed roasted pistachios the peel of one preserved lemon broom wall removed the Peels and diced the peels as finely as possible salt to taste one tablespoon or 10 grams of lemon juice and a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of extra virgin olive oil plus more to taste stir and you have your relish now once your Sprouts are done pop them into a bowl season it takes with salt and lemon juice to taste and plating is really easy put your Sprouts on a big old serving tray or a plate generously fill it up with your gray or foam in randomized places I like to actually serve this with the isi on the table and people can add more gray or foam to their hearts desire spread your relish across the top add some parsley for garnish and that's a Brussels sprout you'll never forget now we have before us arguably my most ideal Thanksgiving meal I can possibly think of is there more to this could we do more pies could we add more of this and that well that's a never-ending thought process but I'll tell you one thing taste testing time is not wow we got a meal in front of us there's a nice mix of Joshi poo and traditional I'm gonna start with dessert because you never know at this point in time in this economy we could all die at any moment so oh hello bye-bye oh the pie is good hair it's good I want the salad from the salad Caesar salad is sitting it's got the anchovy hi sweetie cornbread a little bit of sweetness but it's also Savory all right next one how is it so straight it's so straight when he does that you can cook boy you see the beauty of this is It's balance it doesn't have any of that bitterness that this stuff has and you get a little bit of champagne that's okay all right very good Papa oh Jesus let me just say something about this turkey it's the roast that everybody really wants during Thanksgiving there will never be anything better than this you understand we almost forgot these robichon potatoes they're sort of my version of Robuchon first off notice how there was no noise wait why are you over here because we've just talked about you giving this one to me oh okay those are better than last year's potatoes you know these these are just a little different they're a little softer they're a little they're a little bit more like a Hawaiian Roller but a Hawaiian roll on steroid the mushroom listen you ain't never had a mushroom like that there's almost a steak quality to it and last but not least a Brussels sprout the one item that everybody skips let me tell you something you ain't never gonna skip these goddamn Brussels you're so crazy with all that being said this is my ideal Thanksgiving you asked for it you got it if you enjoyed this video or you learn something I don't do that anymore I kept doing it and I was like what am I doing what do I usually say lb roll am I okay [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music]

Additional Cookbook...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.385768, is this boat gonna float yeah no absolutely not a few years ago I started to make the cheapest Gourmet sushi rolls that I can and I achieved that goal for the most part but I only left you with three rolls that's just not enough to cover the wide variety of roles that are out there which brings us to today we're making a physical boatload of sushi four brand new rolls with a budget of five dollars per serving originally I wanted this Sushi Boat but that's a hundred dollars not very much cheaper so in the spirit of butt cheaper we're gonna be making our own at home in a way that's not going to completely alliterate our budget I'm gonna put all the sushi on the boat but I can't eat it until I lay it in a body of water and it must float so that makes two goals for us to hit so with all that being said let's make this shall we so first we gotta make our boat we looked up a video on how to fold a paper boat Evan volunteered to figure that out and well it actually worked look at that link in the description for how we did it onto the sushi what have we always talked about you absolutely must wash your rice first you're gonna need two and a half cups or 535 grams of short grain rice place it into a large mesh sieve pop that bad boy into a bowl and fill the bowl all the way up with water until your rice is covered gently agitate the rice drain the water and repeat that process one to two more times until the water runs clear then comes the second issue well what about the rice cooker Josh there's no way around it rice cooker is going to make the best version of rice if you have one then please use it put in equal parts water close it and start your rice cooker but if you don't have a rice cooker then obviously you can use a pot which you'll use the same ratio of water you'll bring the pot to a boil on high heat then turn the heat down to Low cover with a lid cook for 12 minutes then turn the heat off and leave it to steam for 10 more minutes listen this is not Uncle Roger or Uncle Josh approved whatsoever but I'm just showing you the option if you cannot afford a rice cooker now while that rice is cooking you're gonna make your seasoned rice vinegar also called Sushi zoo in a medium sauce pot add three tablespoons or 38 grams of sugar one tablespoon or 18 grams of kosher salt 1 cup of white distilled vinegar heat that over medium heat stirring occasionally until everything's dissolved and it's steamy hot traditionally you would steep combo in this but that doesn't exactly keep the price low does it so instead we're gonna steep one sheet of nori in there for about 10 minutes drain it and that's your zoo now once your rice is done pop that out into a large bowl or if you happen to have it Hungary It's pretty dope carefully seasoned using a large spoon drizzle your sushi juice over the spoon to help distribute over the rice and you're going to cut the rice using a sweeping motion sweep the rice all the way the edges of the bowl gather it all back up into the center season it again cut it again fold it should be good to go after the second or third time once it tastes perfect though it's done pop that back into a pot or your rice cooker to keep it warm and we have four rolls to fill up this boat avocado katsu which I like to call avocatsu a soy brown butter mushroom tempura sweet potato and let's not forget our glazed spam first let's start with our soy brown butter mushroom because it can sit for a little bit in a 12 inch pan add in just enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan heat over medium high add in two portobello mushrooms that have been cubed and let those sear for two to three minutes tossing occasionally until beautifully browned on all sides then add two tablespoons or 24 grams of unsalted butter toss and just let that cook for about one to two minutes or until the butter begins to Brown then cut off the heat and add soy sauce to taste stir the coat and that's it first sushima wrap that bad boy in plastic get yourself one sheet of nori I don't know about a half cup of sushi rice spread it out if you have them add some toasted sesame seeds on top you're gonna carefully flip all right cool not bad in the lower third of your roll add on your Mushroom in a nice row optionally you can add some sliced avocado then using your sushi mat roll it up crimp up a little bit more crimp then finishing all the way cripping it and forming it into a beautifully shape to makimono remove your mat cut it in half and then cut into rolls and it's your soy brown butter mushroom let's move on to our avocatsu first a very simple spicy mayo in a small container add three quarters of a cup or 162 grams of mayonnaise three tablespoons or 45 grams of sriracha a little Pinch of Sugar salt to taste serve everything together and well that's it next an apple Relish in a small bowl I'm gonna add one green apple that's been beautifully brunoise it's just basically a very fine dice best way to do it place your Apple into sheets about an eighth of an inch thick cut those sheets into very fine matchsticks and then cut the opposing way on the Matchstick all the way down to get a beautiful brunwa pop that into a small bowl along with one Thai Chili thinly sliced three tablespoons or 45 grams of white distilled vinegar a quarter cup or 71 grams of soy sauce the juice of one whole lemon optionally a little splash of mirror and that's totally up to you stir together and let that sit now for the avocado you only need one large avocado cut that into quarters peel each piece and then cut each quarter in half now for the breading station very simple in One Bowl One Cup or 150 grams of all-purpose flour in another Bowl two eggs plus one tablespoon or 14 grams of soy sauce with set together till combined and then in the final Bowl one cup or 73 grams of Panko bread crumbs if you know Katsu it's really easy toss it in the flour dust off the excess coat in your egg mixture go with panko and repeat with the rest in the 7 quart heavy bottom pot filled halfway with vegetable oil and heat it to 350 Fahrenheit add in your katsu in two batches and fry for two to three minutes or until a beautiful golden brown avocatsu emerges placed in a wire rack to drain and immediately season generously with salted taste nor you down add on your sushi rice spreading it all the way edge to edge but leaving a little bit of a quarter inch lip at the top in the lower third add one to two of your fried avocado in a row followed by your Apple relish so first cilantro sprigs roll it up nice and thoit and beautiful room for the mat and cut it to six to eight pieces next temper a sweet potato you're gonna need one large sweet potato peel that bad boy cut it in half lengthwise then cut each half in half again to get quarters and then slice that into wedges that are just under a quarter inch thick separately to make your tempura batter get a medium sized Bowl add in one cup or 150 grams of all-purpose flour half a teaspoon or half a gram of baking powder which together until combined then mix in three quarters of a cup or 180 milliliters of carbonated water and one large egg once it's thoroughly mixed it's okay if there's a couple of lumps add an additional soda water if needed then strain out your lumps and now you're ready to fry using your same fry oil from before toss your sweet potato in a little bit of plain all-purpose flour dunk in your tempura batter and immediately drop into your fry oil that's been preheated to 350 Fahrenheit then just fry those bad boys for two to three minutes while there's a fry I'm going to make a very simple chili sauce small pole three tablespoons or 45 grams of mayonnaise one tablespoon or 18 grams of a spicy chili sauce of your choice one teaspoon or 6 grams of soy sauce and stir together until combined that's it real simple if I ever seen a beautiful sweet potato it looks like this right here once it's done in crispy pull it out drain it on a wire rack and immediately season a taste with salt Nori down sushi rice slide onto your mat add on your sweet potato in a nice row followed by two batons a fresh cucumber Josh how do you get this shape can you please help me out of course I can it's literally just a seedless English cucumber cut into segments half the length of your Nori and you're going to cut off just the cheeks if you will you're thinking to cut those into beautiful batons but a third of an inch wide and that's it follow that with Thai basil leaves or regular basil leaves whichever optionally if you want a little bit of you know it's a very thinly sliced Serrano and your sauce to your heart's desire roll that bad boy up and then cut your roll into six to eight pieces we're on to our last one the spam roll first a very basic glaze medium sauce pot add in two tablespoons of 26 grams of light brown sugar bowl with half a tablespoon or 8 grams of white distilled vinegar half a tablespoon or seven grams of sriracha one tablespoon or 14 grams of soy sauce optionally one tablespoon or 18 grams of Hoisin turn the heat on and stir until completely dissolved pour into a container and you're done now hold on one second before we move on what are we gonna do with all this remaining Sushi soup we'll make a pickle relish for this roll so take your remaining Sushi soup bring it to a boil in a medium-sized sauce pot in a separate container you're gonna add in a quarter cup or 42 grams of finely diced cucumber a quarter cup or 42 grams of finely diced onion a quarter cup or 42 grams of red bell pepper also finely diced and finally a quarter cup of 42 grams of finely diced green bell pepper for your hot Sushi zoo on top stir and let that sit until room temp now look the spam is just dummy easy you literally just pop it out of the can cut it into half inch thick and if you have a grill you can totally heat that bad boy upheat it over medium high or you can use a grill pan once you your grill is lightly spray with oil and add in your spam Grill on all sides so you get some beautiful color then immediately brush every single side with your glaze turning often brushing and turning until they're glistening like dark obelisks standing in the night or uh something like that and now we assemble Nori down sushi rice slide it under the mat add in two pieces of your spam or more if you want these are pretty thick so roll that bad boy up slice it beautifully just like the rest and then all you have to do is load up that boat beautifully and I kind of wanted to go with a nice little gradient here right we've got our little sections once your boat is filled any toppings will go on now on the avocatsu you'll have nice little dots of spicy mayo now on the spam roll you're just gonna add a nice light spoonful of your pickled relish directly on top plus some cilantro if you desire now to keep this boat looking pretty we didn't stack all the sushi on top of it so you can't see every roll that we made this boat could probably serve six people and that comes up to five dollars and six cents per serving which puts me slightly over budget but hey delete the most expensive roll out of here and you're good to go but we know why you're here forget the sushi let's see if this thing floats I need a pool noodle thanks Kendrick that you strategically had that I only used half of a pool noodle how much is a pool noodle two dollars for the pack two dollars for the pack one dollar but cheaper here we go yes I told you it floats eat my sushi right now this is uh currently leaking through my ceiling and I don't know why just Joy here we are welcome we have four different rolls cheap price for this right here for the whole goddamn thing well never gonna spend that little at restaurant the beauty of it is many of these are vegetarian completely accidentally because that's really the only way to save money is to be honest let's start with the one that I I'm gonna like the most spam but that's the it's salty it's fatty it's rich but balanced there's the sweetness it's smoky it's good moving on avocatsu a vegetarian's dream that one thoughts was good enough to make a got named boat spin sorry it worked and everyone didn't believe me absolutely not I made backups look at that it's obviously creamy but you get that immediate crunch your brain almost goes is this like fried chicken or something and then right away the avocado moving on to poor sweet potato underrated fragrant sweet crunchy it's a refreshing roll I can eat like 100 of these and I know I'm gonna feel great afterwards love it not low calorie last one it's really hard to choose okay mushroom was my favorite every single one of these are fantastic you make all of them you decide which one your favorite is the goddamn boat close all right mission accomplished on budget and bon voyage foreign [Music] [Music]

Get My Cookbook: http://bit.ly/JW...",2022-12-02 21:59:44.385768, you may have heard of crumble cookies they're taking over the United States and I think they're headed for world domination unless I have something to say about it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I first heard about caramel cookies the hard ways I ordered some of the crew they all fell asleep now they're popping up on Twitter and on Facebook and Instagram I don't think they're that special so I think it's time we end their reign before it begins so let's make this shall we all right here we are Rumble cookies I mean this is quite literally just a bakery with one very small storefront I guess I'll go inside now hello how's it going can I just do one of each one of these yeah yeah thank you um okay pretty Point review first off I'm giving the the actual location a 10 out of 10. because this business model is insanely good it's literally just two gigantic ovens and they just make a little cookies put them in there rotate them out and send them out service 10 out of 10. they were really nice their menu rotates seasonally which I love and honestly all the cookies look pretty good 7 out of ten it would get higher but one of the cookies were really ugly so let's just get out of here so we've got the box so we got a chocolate chip cookie which looks like Bigfoot's toe the s'mores looks good actually it doesn't smell like s'mores this looks like some sort of portal and Guardians of the Galaxy this one actually looks nice whoever did the little nice I start with chocolate chip because that's my favorite cookie it's really not that special I have a high expectation for chocolate chip cookies so my hope is that this place is all about flavored stuff so like this is gonna be good the only problem is like an artificial flavoring somewhere in there well I'll give it a six out of ten now a s'mores oh got a little cheese pole that one I like if you get the marshmallow once the marshmallow is gone it's like completely useless last one smells like a snickerdoodle with don't shoot Electric tastes great and also tastes like absolutely nothing at the same time out of all the desserts that I've had crumble cookies not bad can we do better yeah we can but for what they're offering but we made this video we got the classic chocolate chip of course dulce de leche s'mores and finally Berry cobbler cookie first we begin with the most important the cookie dough all these work off of one common dough but each is a little different for the chocolate chip first large mixing bowl add three cups or 450 grams of all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons or five grams of cornstarch half a teaspoon or two grams of baking soda one teaspoon or 7 grams of fine sea salt whisk that together to combine and set to the side now listen carefully this mixture is going to be the exact same in every single cookie dough so we're only gonna do this once to a large bowl you're gonna add one cup or 200 grams of light brown sugar 1 cup or 200 grams of granulated sugar whisk those together took mine then it was seen one and a quarter cup or 285 grams of melted unsalted butter thin whisk in one egg yolk followed by one whole egg you need to whisk the tarnation out of this finally whisk in two teaspoons or four grams of vanilla extract then add half your flour mix that together till combined then add your remaining flour and mix until you have a beautiful dough now look the rest of this is very simple you'll add a mixture of six ounces or 170 grams of dark chocolate and 4 ounces or 113 grams of milk chocolate that's been rough chopped fold that together and that's your dough cover and let that chill in the fridge for about one hour going to the dulce de leche dough remember the wet's the same brown sugar white sugar melts butter yolk egg Etc but the flour is different large mixing bowl add three cups or 450 grams of all-purpose flour half a teaspoon or half a gram of ground allspice one teaspoon or three grams of ground cinnamon half a teaspoon or two grams of baking soda 2 teaspoons or 5 grams of corn starch one teaspoon or 7 grams of fine sea salt then whisk together till combined and you know the drill add half your flour to the wet mix together till combined add the rest mix and that's actually it for that dough cover that and let that rest in the fridge next the s'mores dough gotta wanted to go for a graham cracker flavor so again same wet mixture but for the flour you're gonna do two and a half cups or 375 grams of all-purpose flour a quarter cup or 38 grams of whole wheat flour 2 teaspoons or five grams of corn starch half a teaspoon or two grams of baking soda one teaspoon or seven grams of fine sea salt and whisk until combined makes the flour with the wet combine cover and rest in the fridge for one hour we got one more the cobbler dough this one's special now first you're gonna take one cup of 96 grams of rolled oats pop that into a food processor and pulse until you get a fine powder with tiny little chunks now large bowl two cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour followed by your oat flour two teaspoons or five grams of cornstarch 207 grams of fine sea salt half a teaspoon of 2 grams of baking soda whisk and well don't make me say it again you put the thing with the thing and you mix it you gotta dough cover and pop into your chili Zone box the baking of these is very simple first dulce de leche small bowl add half a cup or 100 grams of granulated sugar and one and a half teaspoons or four grams of ground cinnamon so together and well that's cinnamon sugar now take your dough get yourself two and a half tablespoons of big old balls roll them around in your sugar place them on a parchment lined baking sheet about two inches apart then flatten the dough with the palm of your hand or the flat bottom of a glass pop them into your oven that's been preheated to 350 Fahrenheit and bake for seven to nine minutes and this applies to every single dough that there is listen the key to a Great Cookie is actually to under bake them a little bit you want a little bit of that gooey goodness now we got a lot of toppings so let's make this simple now for the actual dulce de leche all you need is as many cans of sweetened condensed milk as you want the 14 ounce ones pop them into a large pot cover with enough water so that they're fully submerged by about one to two inches bring to a boil on medium high then reduce to a simmer and cook for three hours I know it's a long time but you open it up and look at the fruits of your labor you're going to want to smooth this out support it into a small mixing bowl whisk get thoroughly and if you want it extra smooth pass through a fine mesh strainer let it cool completely and keep in the fridge now for the toasted milk Queen in a saucepan add half a cup or 60 grams of dried milk powder placed on medium heat and just continuously cook and stir that until you start to get some nice Browning then add in one cup or 240 milliliters of whole milk bring it up until steamy and hot and turn off the heat and steep for 10 minutes strain that into a separate container and cool completely separately in a mixing bowl you're gonna add one cup or 227 grams of softened unsalted butter now beat that together until nice and whip the nut in 4 cups or 450 grams of powdered sugar in batches until fully incorporated then beat in one teaspoon or 4 grams of vanilla extract and finally add your toasted milk just to loosen until the texture is thick and smooth like this pop that into a Piping Bag and you're ready to assemble now the assembly here is simple get your baked cookie add a nice heaping tablespoon of your dulce de leche on top spit it around so you get a nice Circle in the center then using a star tip Piping Bag pipe out a nice little dot of your toasted milk cream optionally you can give it a nice grating of fresh nutmeg and that's your cookie repeat with the rest now moving on to s'mores you got your baked cookies same concept 350 8 to 9 minutes but this one are doing a little different you know instead of doing a marshmallow in the center I thought well what if we did like a marshmallow meringue get yourself a medium-sized heat proof Bowl add in four egg whites one cup or 200 grams of granulated sugar and a quarter teaspoon cream of tartar whisked together put it on top of lightly simmering water makes it a pinch of fine sea salt and then just heat that in the bowl of a stand mixer to warm and dissolve move that to a stand mixer with the Whisk attachment and beat on high until get medium stiff glossy pinks like this then beat in one teaspoon or 4 grams of vanilla extract now pop that into a Piping Bag and to assemble you take your cookie you place it down you get one cup of 140 grams of semi-sweet chocolate chips melt those bad boys pop those into a Piping Bag get a nice drizzling of your melted chocolate on top of each cookie then pipe on your marshmallow topping however your heart desires you want to do it in the center totally fine the only thing I recommend is that you torch this beautifully after piping on and you're ready to serve now look the chocolate chip cookie dough is obvious you put it on the baking sheet you put it in the oven 8 to 12 minutes and she's beautiful last but certainly not least the berry cobbler first we're gonna make a very basic raspberry jam now medium saucepan add in one and a half pounds or 680 grams of raspberries all that with anywhere between one and a half to two and a half cups or 200 50 to 500 grams of granulated sugar toss that together and let it sit for 10 minutes to macerate that's macerate all right keep your mind out of the gutter now add two and a half tablespoons or 23 grams of lemon juice bring that up to heat over medium high then once that comes up to a simmer begin mashing your berries and let that boil for about eight to ten minutes until reduced be sure to test its thickness for about five to ten minutes pass that through a sieve to strain up the seeds and cool completely now if it's reduced enough its texture should look like this windshield now let's talk Cinnamon Streusel topping first medium sized Bowl add in one cup 150 grams of all-purpose flour half a cup or 100 grams of white sugar half a cup or 100 grams of light brown sugar half a teaspoon or two grams of ground cinnamon half a teaspoon or two grams of fine sea salt and half a teaspoon or two grams of ground nutmeg whistle together token Bond and this next step is very important to get a fork and you're going to carefully drizzle in six and a half tablespoons or 91 grams of unsalted butter while constantly clawing and tossing until clumpy but relatively combined you want it to look like this now scatter that over a parchment lined baking sheet and bake it 350 Fahrenheit until just barely crisp through about five to seven minutes let that cool completely and your topping is done last but not least our cream cheese frosting I mean we've made this a million times right medium-sized Bowl two thirds of a cup or 150 grams of salted softened butter beat together using an electric mixer filled out with 8 ounces or 225 grams of full fat cream cheese if you're on a diet hey just don't make this beat those two together with a hand mixer then once that's beat it in three and a half cups or 415 grams of powdered sugar in batches until smooth and homogeneous follow that with one and a half teaspoons or eight grams of vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract then just loosen that with milk about one teaspoon at a time until thickened to your desired consistency just remember if you make it too thin it's not going to sit very nice now pop that into a Piping Bag with a round tipped attachment and let's assemble first nice little swirl of your cream cheese frosting leaving a little bit of space in between each little ring like this now separately with your raspberry jam also in a Piping Bag fill that space now I really like this it looks really nice finish that by crumbling your Cinnamon Streusel topping across the top of each and every finished cookie and look at that we have all four of our little babies right here now look I've got to say we're going into this battle I'm pretty sure I over baked my cookies oh boy here we go look at these two honestly they both look pretty good let's start with the original chocolate chip oh if you do not like dark chocolate you won't like this you're gonna prefer this so next cookie is the s'mores I like that this marshmallow has a chewing this one kind of doesn't but you get marshmallow in every single bite and that's what I don't like about this but I'll give it a tie now this one on the other hand good Lord I think that's my favorite one by far this is a Razzle Dazzle this is probably the sweetest of all the cookies but the biggest thing is it doesn't have artificial flavor it's like a natural fruit last but not least is this guy hello honestly this one's also a toss-up I can taste all the flavors in this that's the biggest missing thing with these I taste no butter no depth no saltiness it's just kind of like sweet and whatever Associated flavor so a bit of a toss-up on some of them but we have a taste tester coming in to decide the winner oh my God why is it getting so dark in here who are you here and try some cookies I'm gonna begin with the chocolate chip Okay cookie number one and cookie number two we're gonna go number one on that one there is a greater depth of flavor there a lot more saltiness a lot more buttery now second cookie is the s'mores one oh this is crazy I'm afraid that I'll fly two first one a lot more flavors in that one than this one which felt like it was primarily cooking I felt like a little bit of marshmallow that's great time for the third Berry cobbler more cookies should have Jam number one now number two here's another one for number one there's something artificial to this which makes me think it's horrible that's a rock and the jam is just better great number one of the second of the last one very taking such small bites lots of sugar is bad for your teeth what are you sponsored by dentists that was number two this one's hard both pretty good can I hold the other one as well this one's a bit chewier this one bit of a crunch which I don't think is bad flavor-wise they're kind of the same so I'm gonna have to give it to this one damn it this is what happened make your cookies how many of yours I voted for one are you serious I'm just glad that it was the chocolate chip you voted for because this is the one that's out of my cookbook I'll take that as a w it's a butt better loss I'll take it crumble you created the game of top cookies but this will be the last time Something's Gonna Get topped do you want to know what else is getting top b-roll foreign [Music] [Music]

take a look at our dim sum spread we've got Chung fun which if you've never had these are insane charge you bow but wait a minute baked like little rolls of goodness classic steamed pork dumpling turnip cake and a beautiful sticky rice in a corn husk uh you know keep it cheap look let's start easy pork dumpling we already have a recipe for the dough Link in the description for that but hey you could also just go buy rappers already made I'll pretend that I'm just not looking very simple medium-sized Bowl add in one pound or 450 grams of ground pork or ground chicken whatever you want pork is better though because fat too thinly sliced green onions three cloves of garlic finely chopped optionally half a teaspoon or three grams of toasted sesame oil and one tablespoon or 17 grams of soy sauce mixed together until combined and look it's real simple you get a dumpling wrapper place a heaping teaspoon of meat in the center with the perimeter with water close it like a taco pinch you get in the middle at the top and pleat both sides three to four times to cook you put them in a steamer basket set over a pot with a shallow amount of water in the bottom simmering close the lid in Steam for eight to ten minutes oh that's dumbling you could add a little sesame oil on top chili oil whatever you want now I want to talk about these rice and rolls the Chung fun these are something special they're tedious to make at first but once you make one or two it's easy first we need to make the batter real easy medium sized Bowl add just under a cup or 120 grams of rice flour two tablespoons or 15 grams of corn starch and a quarter teaspoon or half a gram of fine sea salt which together took a mine and then finally add a little over two cups or 500 milliliters of water whisked together and once combined let that rest for 20 minutes now while it's resting we're gonna make our mushrooms you're gonna need half a pound or 225 grams of mushrooms whoa whoa whoa Josh that's a trumpet mushroom what is this rich boy hours listen there's a secret to getting nice mushrooms for a good price and that is to go to a local Asian market and check the prices you may very well get these mushrooms for borderline the same price as regular old button mushroom but if you can't fight it for a good price then you can go with whatever you can afford taste your mushrooms into half inch cubes get a large stainless steel pan heat over medium high add just enough oil to coat the pan add in your mushrooms and sear for two to three minutes tossing occasionally until they're lightly brown but still have a little bit of then add in one cup or 75 grams of rough chopped cabbage tossed till just wilted then add a splash of soy sauce just a taste toss again and that is your mushroom now here's the technique you can do this with a number of things but I really recommend doing with an eighth sheet tray like this you need to brush with a thin veneer of vegetable oil and then you're going to pour just enough batter to create a microscopic layer that coats the entire thing and here's how you steam it large Wok add a shell amount of water into the wok then using a trivet or you can use balls of foil or if whatever you have just fits in there without touching the bottom great bring the water up to a boil of or medium high reduce the heat to low so it's a nice light simmer add in your battered tray cover with foil and let it Steam for two to three minutes or until just firmed up remove let it cool completely then all you got to do is add a little bit of your mushroom mix to two-thirds of it then carefully roll it over itself over and over to create a nice rice roll hey that's pretty much it look you're gonna need some practice when you do it but repeat with as many rice rolls as you want you pop them under plate and top with anything but ideally a little bit of chili oil whatever you have on hand that's the whole point here next one might have you scratching your head turnip kick you Josh what is the croissant is that listen this blew my mind I'm not gonna lie first you need one powder 450 grams of daikon as a big boy peel that bad boy and great over the course side of a cheese grater separately you're gonna need three drudge shiitake mushrooms we're boiling hot water over them weigh them down with a Ramekin let them sit for 10 minutes till rehydrated remove ring out the water and dice turn up it can kind of be sort of an everything in the kitchen sink and the thing but you have to adhere to a few rules first get a walk ripping hot add in a couple tablespoons of vegetable oil to coat the bottom once that's hot optionally add in a handful of rough chopped cured meat now what does that mean any sort of cured meat that you have it could even be pre-cooked meat really let that sear tilt gets a little bit of color then add three cloves of rough chopped garlic one shallot thinly sliced or diced stir-fried just until it begins to turn translucent then add in your daikon stir and saute add a touch of white pepper to taste and at this point if you have any seasonings you want to add you got mushroom powder great you want a little splash of soy sauce great you don't have any of that totally fine continue cooking until most of the liquid is evaporated then toss in your mushrooms and turn the heat off now for the batter medium sized Bowl add a one and a quarter cup or 170 grams of rice flour one tablespoon or 9 grams of cornstarch three quarters of a teaspoon or three grams of sugar half a teaspoon one gram of salt whisk together choke of mine then whisk in 1 cup or 240 milliliters of water once that's nice and smooth in homogeneous add in your turnip mixture stir together and you're nearly done get yourself a small bread pan coat it generously with cooking spray and you can do the exact same steamer setup in your Wok that we did before fill with water get it steaming add in your filled bread pan cover the foil and let that Steam for 25 to 30 minutes yes you will need to replenish the steaming water if you don't run out and then oh my gosh why is there smoke everywhere be careful now once it's done cool that completely then invert your legally loaf slice into uh slices and then at this point you'll just sear those in a pan that's been lightly coated with oil until you get a beautiful crispy crust this is a life-changing thing right turnip cake doesn't sound that good prints out I'm actually a huge fan now now I know you've been waiting for this let's talk about these bows how can I help myself here you know come on first are dough in a large bowl add in four cups or 600 grams of bread flour a quarter cup of 56 grams of sugar and one and a half teaspoons or 11 grams of fine sea salt and stir together till combine now in a separate container add one cup or 240 grams of whole milk two-thirds of a cup or 150 grams of heavy cream I know it's weird but it works here heat that at 95 degrees Fahrenheit Fahrenheit than whiskin one tablespoon or 12 grams of instant yeast whisk till the yeast is dissolved and then whisk in one whole egg until homogeneous now add your wet mixture to your dry mix by hand till it starts to come together and if it's too loose you can always add a little bit more flour if needed speaking of kneading things once that dough comes together you're going to need by hand for about three to five minutes or until beautifully smooth and voluptuous Now cover that with plastic wrap and rise for one hour or until dubled now while those bad boys are rising we have to make our pork filling now first you're gonna need two cups of rough chopped Chariot now hold on you want to use Char shoe totally fine you can either use leftover meat or you can make your own to make your own you'll need one and a half pounds or 680 grams of boneless pork Boston butt slice it into one inch thick slices and separately in a bowl you're gonna combine three cloves of finely chopped garlic a quarter cup of 55 grams of granulated sugar one and a half teaspoons or five grams of Chinese five spice which big tip on the five Spice if you go to a place that sells it in bulk you don't have to buy a whole bottle for like five bucks instead you can purchase exactly what you need for less than a dollar one teaspoon or four grams of kosher salt two tablespoons or 33 grams of oyster sauce that's optional two tablespoons or 30 grams of soy sauce and optionally and eighth of a tea spoon of red food coloring now look this does absolutely nothing for the flavor it's a thing done in many restaurants you get the typical red exterior finally two tablespoons of 45 grams of Honey mixed together until combined toss your pork in that cover it and let it marinate in the fridge for one hour and up to overnight once you're ready to cook snag yourself a baking sheet top of the wire rack add your pork to the wire rack fill the bottom with about two cups of boiling water and place in an oven set to 425 Fahrenheit for 15 minutes now hang on don't throw away your marinade yet probably should have said that earlier after that 15 minutes you're gonna take out your meat brush both sides with the marinade cook for 10 more minutes then raise the temperature to 475 brush an additional time if needed and cook for three more minutes or till caramelized on the outside and lightly good Lord look at that God dang and it's juicier more tender than any Char sue you ever had in your life you're welcome get about two to three tablespoons in a large Wok over high heat once that's ripping hot you're gonna add two rough chopped shallots a little bit of salt to taste stir fry till it starts to soften then add in two cups of rough chopped Char Shu stir fried till hot and starting to get a little bit of color then add in two tablespoons or 30 grams of granulated sugar three tablespoons or 45 grams of soy sauce a little splash of white distilled vinegar another little splash of toasted sesame oil bring that bad boy to a boil then in a separate container you're gonna whisk together three quarters of a cup or 180 grams of chicken stock and one and three quarters of a tablespoon or 21 grams of all-purpose flour that's right folks if you hadn't guessed already this is not gluten-free now add your chicken stock mix to your boiling Wok stir and continuously stir fry until it thickens beautifully now taste test that add additional soy sauce as needed then once that's thickened to your liking cut off the heat and stir in two thinly sliced green onions two cloves of garlic minced and it should be beautifully fragrant and finally it's done now make sure that that's cooled completely then once your dough has risen from its grave ah look at the little man that's so cute then punch all the yeast fart out of your dough sorry pretty much what it is divide the dough into 60 gram balls which will get you about 16 equal pieces roll each of those into a light ball and let them rest for 10 minutes once your dough balls have rested roll those bad boys out into a disc that's about four to five inches wide fill with just under a tablespoon of your pork mixture carefully wrap that disc around closing all the seams roll into a light ball place in a parchment lined baking sheet and repeat with the rest now you can only fit around this many on a baking sheet so you may need two baking sheets totally fine but once those are all done cover with greased plastic wrap and let that proof for 30 to 45 minutes or until festively plump now we're ready to bake brush those bad boys with egg wash consisting of one egg plus one tablespoon of water whisk together until homogeneous brush each and every little ball and of course optionally if you want you can totally add sesame seeds to the top of each this does two things a it adds texture and flavor but B it also looks like a cute little burger bun that has a surprise inside now place that into an oven that's been set to 375 Fahrenheit and bake for 15 to 20 minutes remove and then optionally you can brush with a sugar syrup which if you want to know how we made it you're going to take two tablespoons or 28 grams of sugar mix that with two tablespoons or 28 milliliters of water heat it a small pot till dissolved and well that's it you can use that to brush but I mean look at these things you tear this open and the steam is erupting out of it you can smell the charge wafting through your air conditioning vents I mean this is a beautiful thing let me tell you I want you to listen very closely to me I love you all but if you've never had sticky rice at a dim sum cart you're missing a major Cornerstone of what it means to be alive now typically they're wrapped in Lotus Leaf that's not exactly but cheaper friendly but you know what is a corn husk I know not traditional but we gotta use something here pale so first you'll need about six to seven corn husks soak them in hot water for 10 minutes then separately get yourself a steamer basket line the bottom with parchment paper then wrestle yourself one and a quarter cup of 275 grams of glutinous rice you know the drill folks wash your rice thoroughly and then this time you're gonna place your rice in a container add just enough water to cover and let that soak for one hour once it's done drain it place your soaked Rice under your parchment lined spamboo steamer get yourself a medium sized pot fill it with about two inches of water bring it to a boil reduce heat to medium low and place your bamboo steamer on top with its lid and let that brother Steam for 20 minutes now while that steaming you're gonna make our sauce and our Chico small bowl add two teaspoons or eight grams of sugar two tablespoons of 36 grams of soy sauce one tablespoon or 14 grams of white vinegar was that together and then we're constantly whisking finished with one and a half teaspoons or five grams of cornstarch once that's dissolved cut three boneless and skinless chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces then in a wok or a large pan heat just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom over medium high and add your chicken and sear until you get some light Browning about two to three minutes now add all of your sauce now once your chicken's browned and for the most part cook through don't worry it doesn't have to be fully cooked and I'll explain why in a second let that boil and once it thickens add additional salt to taste turn the heat off and add two cloves of finely chopped garlic and toss until [Music] now to assemble get a soaked corn husk add a small bed of rice in the center followed by a spoonful of your chicken top with additional rice wrap it up nicely and tie with either a piece of additional corn husk or kitchen twine if you have it once your corn husks are stuffed add them back to your bamboo steamer and steam again for another 15 to 20 minutes open it up to a nice little bundle of parcels that await what could be in them is a little present for Peppa turns out it's a little present for you now I've got a good feeling this is all worth it so let's hop on our dim sum cart tool it around and see how we did you know dim sum is best shared with people so I went to the local abandoned mall to find some new friends to share with oh got stuck here oh hey Kendrick what do you do this one okay we've got a lot of different dim sum here all right steam dumpling simple pretty sure it's haunted extremely uncomfortable well I'll tell you what these dumplings ain't uncomfortable yeah I don't taste like no butt cheaper to me salty perfect good chew on The Dumpling dough I want one of these baked bouts it looks like a little hamburger bun soft perfect here's the thing baked bow I'll be a traditional or not will absolutely change your mind about what you think a bow should be this is scrumptious I mean the outside unbelievably soft got that burnished sort of bun quality but the inside immediately you're like oh my God wait this is bow sticky rice you get kind of like a little bit of a corn Masa flavor which I like corn husk you can find anywhere and it adds flavor okay what this guy I don't have any chopsticks that might be my favorite Chung fun that hits different the most tender silky dumpling you've ever had in robing really whatever you put inside it in this case we have a sort of a vegetarian filling but you could go with pork you could go with beef pick the cheapest vegetable you got make it taste good turnip cake seared nicely turning cake almost acts as a palette cleanser while simultaneously being this salty sort of nice little concoction anyway I kind of feel like it completes this but at the end of the day this is a dim sum cart and this is even the full portion there's more in the kitchen I can't think of a better meal but in that process be sure to take care of your financial health and thankfully chime will be there for you when you need it most and remember get your paycheck benefits stimulus check up to two days

Amazon Fresh: https://www.youtube.com/c/AmazonFresh...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.385768, I think it's high time we break the idea of the family meal and turn it into something a little more exciting [Music] if you enjoy life-changing Feast you've come to the right place this video is sponsored by Amazon Fresh so big thanks to them we're at the physical Amazon Fresh store in Naperville which fun fact is where our little man big room is from I like to get my ingredients from local farms but I also need the convenience of a grocery store that has a wide selection of Great Value items that papa needs I imagine you do right well this Amazon Fresh store has that look it's always a competition on who can shop faster in my family and to my surprise Amazon Fresh was the answer to that the dash cart gives you the convenience of skipping the checkout lens while you see your total in your cart as you shop oh so go to your local Amazon all right that was my fault but do go to a local Amazon fresh grocery store near you or shop online for delivery it's easy now back to the recipe all right if we're gonna make something worthy of replacing Thanksgiving dinner let's do this right by starting with dessert because hey you never know what's gonna happen right now look you can totally make Baklava which is great and I have a rest before it links in the description but today we're going to make something a little bit different we're gonna make hellva which is actually shockingly easy so first start with an eight and a half inch by four and a half inch loaf pan give it a little spray tan a vegetable oil lined with parchment paper leaving some overhang then a medium sized Bowl adding one and three quarters of a cup or 415 grams of good quality tahini try to find the best that you can three quarters of a cover 80 grams of shelled pistachios mixed together then in a medium sauce pot add half a cup or 113 grams of water and one pound for 450 grams of green related sugar Pizza medium until everything's dissolved then increase the heat to high and boil that bad boy until it reaches 250 degrees Fahrenheit cut off the heat then while constantly stirring add in your hot syrup mixture stir that bad boy for about 20 to 40 seconds or just until the mixture begins to pull from the sides of the bowl do not over stir this what happens if you over stir this is going to turn into a crumbly dry mess now quickly add that to your prepared loaf pans press it down you can add some additional pistachios on top then just cool that bad boy completely to serve it you just cut into slices cut it into squares but please be sure that it's cooled completely first now let's make this meal while that bad boy set can't have a proper meal without a nice bread so we're gonna make something that's kind of buzzlama inspired which is a delectable flatbread very easy first combine two and a half teaspoons or 10 grams of instant yeast and 1 Cup or 236 grams of lukewarm water one tablespoon of 15 grams of granulated sugar whisk that bad boy together till dissolved then add two tablespoons or 24 grams of extra virgin olive oil 2 teaspoons or eight grams of kosher salt stir that together then finally add three quarters of a cup or 175 grams of yogurt stir that bad boy together now in a large mixing bowl three and a half cups for 525 grams of all-purpose flour except you're only gonna add half fat into your bowl add all of your yeasty milky Yoki wogey Juice mix it together until you get a batter then add the rest of your flour and stir to get a rough dough then knead by hand for three to five minutes or until you have a beautifully smooth uh dough cover the plastic wrap and rise for one hour punch it down then divide it into 10 evenly sized pieces about 91 grams each roll those bad boys into light cover with a damp towel rests for 10 minutes and preheated 10 to 12 inch pan over medium low and all you got to do take a little ball roll it into a seven inch circle try to keep it as circular as possible do that with all of your dough balls dusting with flour as needed now to cook these once your pan is hot brush the top surface of a flatbread with extra virgin olive oil very lightly pop it into your pan cook for one to one and a half minutes or until the top begins to get nice and bubbly brush that part lightly with extra virgin olive oil flip and cook for another one and a half to two minutes or until it looks absolutely lovely please don't tell or something hand knitted by ulysses's grandmother but we need another layer of starch and it's not going to be potatoes it's gonna be rice it's two and a half cups or 220 grams of medium grain rice that is washed tired of saying it wash your rice anyway get a medium Skillet and add two and a half tablespoons or 35 grams of unsalted butter eat over medium and once that's melted in add in a third cup or 60 grams of orzo toast that bad boys constantly stirring about two minutes or until it starts to deepen in color add your drained washed rice toast that bad boy in there for another minute then add that to a rice cooker add in two and a half cups or 600 milliliters of chicken stock close your rice cooker and well just press the on button because that's why rice cooker are amazing thank you all right now we need veg let's move quickly here first off pickles you can't go wrong with having a little bowl of pickles on the side first medium sauce pot add three cups or 700 milliliters of white distilled vinegar one cup or 240 milliliters of water 2 teaspoons or 10 grams of granulated sugar one and a quarter tablespoon or 18 grams of kosher salt this in the stove over medium high and bring that bad boy to a boil now while that's coming up you're gonna make a nice sachet by getting some cheese Glock laying a little patch down adding one teaspoon or two grams of cumin seeds one tablespoon or three grams of coriander seeds wrap that bad boy up tie it up tightly and for your veg you just need three carrots sliced three red Fresno chilies thinly sliced and two large cucumbers guess what also slice which you can do on a mandolin if you want pop this into a large heat proof container add in the sachet and put your hot vinegar mixture over your vegetables and let it cool completely option you can add plastic wrap on top if you want to keep them submerged next let's make some grilled papers set a wire rack over an open flame Char for Anaheim peppers and two red bell peppers all over every little bit but Anaheim peppers I want to charge differently now as we know the red bell pepper you Char until it is totally blackened as possible the Anaheim Peppers I'm not gonna peel so you're gonna go lightly on that chart and just get little speckles of char once they're charred nicely pop them into a bowl cover the plastic wrap and let that sit for about 10 minutes and remove the plastic wrap wipe off just your bell peppers remove the seeds of both and cut into two inch chunks now medium sized Bowl add your peppers along with one garlic clove grated three tablespoons or two grams of very friendly chopped parsley half a teaspoon or half a gram of fresh thyme finely chopped one and a half teaspoons or half a gram of ground cumin salt and pepper to taste two tablespoons or 30 grams of lemon juice a quarter cup of 53 grams of extra virgin olive oil gently mix that together and then she grilled paper now it's almost Shawarma time but I got one more important piece for you you see this pastry this is called the ghostly am I pronouncing that right I have absolutely no idea but it is ridiculous and it's very easy get a medium sized Bowl add two and a half cups or 375 grams of all-purpose flour three quarters of a teaspoon or seven grams of fine sea salt mixed together then add three quarters of a cup or 171 grams of warm water and 5 tablespoons or 55 grams of extra virgin olive oil mix it together take it a rough dough then need that bad boy by hand for five minutes or until oh my gosh smooth good Lord cover and let that rest for about 10 to 15 minutes now remove from the bowl dusting with flour as needed separate them into four even pieces and it's made very simply like this you take a piece you roll it into a 8 by 14 inch rectangle or as close to that as possible and then you make your garlic spinach filling by getting a medium sized Bowl adding three quarters of a pound or 350 grams of baby spinach that's been roughly chopped or torn by hand three cloves of very finely chopped garlic two whole eggs toss squeeze with your hands I mean really crunch down on this you want a bruise you want to ruin that spinach now on your lower half of your rolled out dough add your spinach mix generously followed by some crumbled feta a little bit of fresh parsley leaves and optionally some grated casseri cheese hold the other side over kind of like a calzone using water to seal if needed seal thoroughly on one side then heat two tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large nonstick pan over medium high then once your Pan's hot slide in here goes let me cook pressing down lightly to keep the edges flat and cook for three minutes flip and cook for another two to three minutes that is it it's really that easy and look at it I mean it's impressive you slice it it's crispy on the outside chewy it's kind of got a scallion pancake Vibe but it's stuffed with cheese and spinach and garlic and I'm gonna bust it down just thinking about it you can't have this without a sauce this is Tomb it is single handily one of my most favorite sauces in the entire world and albeit not Turkish it is Lebanese it is unbelievable I'm going to show you how to make it first you're gonna need one and a quarter cup or 120 grams of garlic cloves peeled yes a lot cut each of those garlic cloves in half and remove the center germ from each and every half it's tedious it's worth it put all the garlic in a food processor along with two and a half teaspoons or seven grams of kosher salt put on the lid pulse your food processor a few times until it's finely minced now look here we have three and a half tablespoons or 52 grams of lemon juice first you're going to start by adding just one tablespoon of that lemon juice into your food processor process that until it paste forms add another tablespoon then process constantly until it's smooth and almost like fluffy looking kind of like a cloud you're gonna drizzle in half a cup or 120 milliliters of vegetable oil follow that with the remaining one and a half tablespoons of your lemon juice then drizzle in another half cup of vegetable oil then a little splash of ice water another half cup of oil and repeat this process until you've added a grand total of three cups or 700 milliliters grand total of vegetable oil and what are you left with the most beautiful voluptuous garlic sauce that will ever grace you your mouth and next to yogurt dip called jajik get a bowl add one and two thirds of a cup or 400 grams of yogurt one tablespoon or two grams of finely chopped mint two tablespoons or eight grams of finely chopped dill and look we got one large cucumber that's been sliced and diced into half inch cubes you're gonna add the majority of that but just preserve a little bit for later two cloves of garlic grated two tablespoons or 24 grams of extra virgin olive oil salt to taste and give it a nice mix until combined but your remaining diced cucumbers on top a little bit of zatar for Pizzazz parsley leaves flaky salt and a nice healthy glug of additional extra virgin olive oil now for the most important thing the Shawarma you can do this many ways but if you want to be OG you're gonna need one of these bad boys and you can click the link in the description and get it on Amazon Bing Bong but look you really don't need it honestly you do not it's mostly a nice to have first you're gonna need three to four pounds of chicken thighs you can also use lamb shoulder or beef but we're using chicken thighs now look you can use the boneless skinless I will say that having some of the thighs with skin on it does make a big difference but you will have to debone them in order to do that now with your thighs you're going to season them with the follower one and a half tablespoons or 15 grams of kosher salt one and a quarter tablespoon eight grams of sweet paprika one teaspoon or half a gram of turmeric powder one teaspoon or five grams sugar one tablespoon or eight grams of ground cumin one and a half teaspoons or four grams of cinnamon one tablespoon or eight grams of ground cumin two teaspoons or three grams of ground cardamom one teaspoon or two grams of ground black pepper and mix to coat thoroughly there's a methodology to how you stack this you don't just slap on your rod and roll it all the way up to the top of your rock that doesn't sound right first you're gonna need one white onion that's been very thinly sliced and 10 cloves of garlic that have also been very thinly sliced to process that first one chicken thigh top that with a few slices of your white onion and a couple slices of your garlic on your spindle next layer chicken thigh slide it all the way down but look notice how we're doing it opposite direction you're going to keep doing that where it goes chicken thigh onion garlic another chicken thigh onion garlic boom and just keep change changing the direction in way that you're facing the chicken so that it's a nice rounded Rod now look the beauty of this machine is you literally just turn on the spindle turn on the propane powered back end of it and well there you go it's just gonna do that it'll take about an hour but once it starts to cook you slice it off fresh and look at the juice on this bad boy I think we need a taste test how am I supposed to eat all this definitely a little bit it is it's good and all but like how much flavor could it really have good Lord obviously the bread's not quite none not quite Pita it's sort of Riff Off basalama soft chewy salty fatty chicken that is unreal the garlic sauce forget about it a little bit of this cucumber yogurt you can eat this straight up or you put a little bit on here I just had an Amazon rain shower I have a little real Peppy sweet crunchy acidic come on I don't really like spinach but this will make it go down easy it's like a nice little salty spinach pastry rice we know and love cooked beautifully in a rice cooker as it should always be delicious and the stock makes a difference pop a little pickle oh extra surprise and to finish it out we've got helva it's just such a solid end of a meal it's not too sweet it's almost like what fudge wanted to be a lot of time when I have fudge I'm like oh it's a little too sweet this you've got like toasted sesame the pistachio and a light sweetness the chew it melts in your mouth listen this is perfect for hosting or by yourself the point is this should be your next Feast don't you guys agree come on that's what I thought obviously this can all be scaled up to any family size this should be your next meal aren't you tired of turkey break the goddamn mold get a spindle make it go or you can put it on skewers and put it in the oven it's not like you gotta have this thing though thank you again the Amazon Fresh for sponsoring today's video I know they're

problem I've never been there and we have zero locations anywhere near us but then our VP Vikram told me they're popping in Chicago so we had to make the trip out there we bottled up our version of the sauce that successfully made it through TSA hopped on a plane and our challenge awaited us except we haven't done any of that yet and we still have to make this shall we [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is very different we don't have the home court advantage and more specifically never been to Nando's I've never tasted it all I have to go off of is photos and maybe some review on Yelp I don't know instead of bringing the restaurant to me I gotta bring me to the restaurant let's just pray we get this recipe right let's be honest all people care about is the Peri-Peri sauce and the chicken but we're also gonna make Pyrenees corn for the Peri-Peri brown butter chips fries but the English want to call it chips chips fries just make up your mind and garlic bread first the coveted look it's real simple get one white or yellow onion cut it in quarters peel it and pop it over an open flame Char on all sides pop into a bowl do the same thing with two red bell peppers don't be afraid of the Char unless you don't like Flavor in which case I guess throw it right out the window pop it into your bowl cover let it sit for five minutes and take it out then into a blender add your onions making sure to remove the little hairy bush at the bottom I don't know how else to say it wipe off the chart bits off your red bell pepper remove the seeds rough chop if desired remove the stems from Seven Red Thai chilies now hang on these aren't Peri-Peri chilies but they're a good alternative pop into your blender oh how funny man doesn't want to go and get in there followed by the zest of one lemon the juice of one lemon that's the same lemon by the way a third cup or 73 grams of white distilled vinegar seven Red Thai chilies four teaspoons or 10 grams of smoked paprika three quarters of a teaspoon or half a gram dried oregano three quarters of a teaspoon or three grams of ground white pepper eight cloves of garlic rough chopped and blend until smooth is physically possible toss that into a pot set the heat to medium then add one tablespoon or 15 grams of light brown sugar 1 bay leaf and optionally one and a half tablespoons or 18 grams of a nice whiskey a little fancy now increase your heat to medium high bring it up to a boil reduce to low remove your bay leaf and let that simmer and reduce for about 20 minutes now pop that back into a blender adding lemon juicer water to loosen add salt to taste and one to two tablespoons of honey for sweetness if you want and blend it on high until as smooth as physically possible yes it can get smoother than while constantly blending streaming half a cup or 100 grams of vegetable oil now look if you want the color darker so it matches Nando's you can always add a little extra paprika or more chilies but just be aware that more chilies make it more spicy I don't want to hear any Josh is too spicy finish it off with an additional three cloves of garlic completely raw so you get a little bit of cooked a little bit of raw lemon until it's fine as possible strain that through a fine mesh strainer into a mixing bowl over a nice bath and cool completely season a taste with salt and that is your look I know we're all here for the Peri-Peri chicken but we're gonna quickly make a Pyrenees medium Bowl two egg yolks salted taste two cloves of garlic grated one tablespoon or 15 grams of Dijon mustard then begin whisking and you're gonna slowly add one and a quarter cup or 255 grams of vegetable oil while constantly whisking adding a drop at a time increasing your stream it'll get thicker and thicker when it starts to get too thick add a little splash of cold water continue to add until all of your vegetable oil has been added add in the juice of half a lemon whisk that in now look if this starts getting too thick don't keep adding oil if you do it'll break and then if the Emulsion breaks you're gonna go to the comments be like Josh didn't work what hell yeah look you have all the information right in front of you you've got this pal now once you have a thick Mayo add in a quarter cup or 55 grams of your Peri-Peri sauce whisk together and you got a well perinase which I don't like the name of but whatever cool you want to do the same thing with the compound butter real easy mixing bowl one cup or 112 grams of softened salted butter lemon with a hand mixer then add a third cup or 72 grams of Peri-Peri sauce beat that bad boy still smooth and homogeneous and well that's actually it you grill some corn you put a little Cornell on top bing bing bing very nice now obviously the butter can be used for other things like for example garlic bread you'll just take your butter mix in one to two cloves of very finely chopped like a quarter cup or four grams of finely chopped parsley mixed together get a girthy baguette put it in half lengthwise cut it into four to five inch segments you probably won't use all of it by the way just put on some butter under each slice pop a new oven set to 375 Fahrenheit and bake for about 15 minutes or until a beautifully toasted garlic bread comes out cut it into pieces and you have a beautiful toasty roasty compound butter garlic bread that makes the Angels Sing from the tippy top of the Nando's mountains look the chips are well chips you can kind of do whatever you want you want to go buy store-bought frozen fries and fry them it's not like I can see what you're doing or who knows maybe I am watching anyway you could do that or you can make a seasoned fry dip by getting a mixing bowl adding three quarters of a cup or 112 grams of all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon of 4 grams of garlic powder half a teaspoon or half a gram of paprika one and a half teaspoons or eight grams of fine sea salt and one cup of ice water whisk together to get a loose batter you get two pounds or 900 grams of russet potatoes you peel them if you like to waste money on stuff you might have a French fry slicer like this still don't know why I bought this but you know what when I need it it sure does come in handy Curry potatoes into batons either half to a third inch thick place them in a bowl salt them generously cover with water and let them sit for about 10 minutes then drain dry them off dip them into your batter and then drop into a fryer that's been preheated to 350 Fahrenheit try for about three to four minutes pull them out and you're gonna season them with a very special mixture of spices which consists of two teaspoons or eight grams of garlic powder half a teaspoon half a gram of onion powder half a teaspoon of one gram of ground cumin one teaspoon one gram of coriander powder and this is the one teaspoon or 4 grams of lemon pepper seasoning doesn't really make sense and does at the same time two and a half teaspoons or five grams of smoked paprika half a teaspoon or one gram of cayenne powder one tablespoon or 11 grams of kosher salt one and a half teaspoons or 10 grams of granulated sugar whisk that together and season your fries generously okay it's the Moment of Truth the chicken truth get a baking sheet cover it with foil unless you like to let the juice get all over it now to serve enough people you'll need at least one whole chicken but you could do two if you've got more people and you're gonna do two split breasts with the wing attached and a legging of thigh separated this is how Nando's does it you can separate however you want you can also go buy an already separated chicken or ask your local butcher to separate it for you oh how kind we're first gonna begin this with a slow roast eat your chicken seasoned taste with salt generously brush very lightly with your Peri-Peri sauce and place it into an oven set the 325 Fahrenheit for about 45 to 50 minutes or until the internal temperature is 160 fahrenheit that's a nice slow roast brother now it's gonna come out here like oh my gosh there's no color on it we're not done pal you're gonna need to get yourself a nice Grill set up with one side cold and one side hot grease your grates brush your chicken with additional Peri-Peri and place it on the grill flipping constantly and all you got to do is every 15 seconds you're gonna flip brush with sauce flip brush with sauce you see what's going on here you're building a beautiful Peri-Peri sauce glaze on this it should be glowing with orange color to get off the grill and you're done let's see how we did despite the fact that we went in blind but whatever and taste test so we carefully packed up our sauce oh and it's off to Chicago it's a little chilly it's only when you walk though we're at victim's family's house they don't have a grill but we got this we're grilling this up and then we're going to Nando's could be better here we are our Perry Perry so far we've had an actually a splendid experience the lemonade is unreal here's the sauce not gonna lie it's very delicious it's getting crispy kind of good nervous damn so spicy but gentle you know this isn't really fast food I mean this is like nicely cooked chicken with sauce but let's bring in mine we have our Contraband let's make this quick hmm that's tough man they're both really good I think it's a tie I think we went through all of this for a tie well I guess we'll do Vikram taste test all right Vic you ready buddy yes sir okay open that I'm trying not to stab you that is so tough they both are very different as Josh said the first one has a bit more Tang but I like kind of the layering of the second one the immediate like oh I enjoy that straight away I would have to give to the first one did I it was Nando's that's Nando's I'm glad we came out here Vikram thank you for your time all right makes sense the one missing element I think this had was the Tang we needed more acid more vinegar more lemon juice but I think this is a good Learning lesson you should always put your best foot forward always put your best effort we did you know what Nando's you deserve it but you also have all the sides that we made which I know are good just not correct but you want to know what is correct b-roll [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] who wrote these instructions oh does that look right yeah yeah

backslash bsfree thinking about our farms for sponsoring that portion of today's video now another recipe oh is it the Easter Bunny okay so welcome back to Studio at the end of the day I don't know why we're doing this I guess what we want to find out does more money equal more flavor usually no but there's only one way to find out so we're gonna take one of our most basic pizzas a New York style and we're gonna make a pizza using the most expensive exotic ingredients that makes sense on a pizza at least to me what more is there to say so with all that being said let's make this shall we hey we gotta do it a pizza all right sorry we have two does both of which aren't really that expensive so let's take a look at the two we got the American dough which of course has sugar in it that's how you make it American and the Italian which is literally just yeast water salt and double O Tipo flower the king of you'll notice that both those are using grams now why is that Papa it's more accurate and if you care about your pizza you'll make it accurate but anyway now for the American pizza dough get yourself a large bowl add 950 grams of all-purpose flour 25 grams of granulated sugar there's the American piece 19 grams of fine sea salt then off to the side get yourself 617 grams of water it's around 95 degrees Fahrenheit then whisking 14 grams Vincent yeast looks like it's nice and uh yeasty for that India flour mixture mix by hand till you get a Shaggy dough and then knead until perfectly smooth about five minutes cover that with plastic wrap and rise at room temperature for about two hours or overnight in the fridge now for the Italian pizza dough it's similar mixing process but this time you're just gonna do large bowl 800 grams of double O Tipo flour specifically you gotta trust Papa okay I'm here for you mix in 16 grams of fine sea salt till thoroughly combine then separately get yourself 512 grams of water around 95 degrees Fahrenheit and whisk in 3-4 grams of instant yeast now for this dough you mix the water in there you need it for about five to six minutes so beautifully smooth but there is no rising at room temp for this you absolutely must wrap it in plastic wrap tightly and place in the fridge overnight you want to get the Taste of Italy wafting into the air now once they're done Rising is the same thing for both of them you're going to divide them into six even pieces the Italian pizza dough will yield 250 gram pieces and the American pizza dough will yield 300 gram pieces shape each of those intoit balls placed on a greased baking sheet covered with greased plastic wrap and let that proof for two to three hours the exact same time and same portion size for each dough now that we have our dough let's begin with the cheap stuff but no skimping on any flavor at all in a sauce pot add in one tablespoon or 9 grams of extra virgin olive oil and one tablespoon or 14 grams of unsalted butter set to medium heat and just barely once that butter starts to melt add in six cloves of garlic rough Chopped season lightly with salt to taste and sweat your garlic for about one minute or until beautifully fragrant then add in two teaspoons or 4 grams of red pepper flakes cook until lightly toasted then finally add in a 28 ounce or 800 gram can of crushed tomatoes optionally you could add a splash of water to your can swirl it around and pour it in follow that with two teaspoons or two grams of dried oregano and one teaspoon or one gram of dried thyme one and a half tablespoons or 21 grams of granulated sugar salted taste give it a little stir then bring that up to a sensuous simmer reduced to low and cook that down for about five to seven minutes or until reduce and thickened beautifully adjust your salt levels and that is your sauce now listen 30 minutes before your dough is done if you're doing this in the oven get out of pizza stone to the lower third of your oven heat that bad boy to the maximum temperature and then assemble look the toppings of the baking is really simple once your sauce is completely cooled take a ball of dough punch it down in the center and make a nice thin perimeter that's the crust right we all know that drip that over your clothes fists and work your pizza around the entire perimeter of itself gently stretching using your knuckles to get a nice 12 to 13 inch pie spread on a couple tablespoons of your sauce in a circular motion beautifully and then sprinkle on fresh grated mozzarella and Monterey Jack cheese you can also go pure mozzarella totally fine just please grate it fresh now pop that bad boy onto a pizza peel or in this case a cutting board now carefully slide that onto your preheated pizza stone close the oven and bake for six to eight minutes and what should emerge is a beautiful and rather relaxed Pizza we've seen this kind of pizza before now let's kick it all the way up first a glaze using the most expensive vinegar that I could find get a large pan out of one cup of 240 milliliters of black garlic vinegar 1 cup of 240 milliliters of Mulberry black vinegar one cup or 200 grams of granulated sugar and half a cup or 115 grams of rough chopped palm sugar instead of a medium high stirring occasionally and once that comes to a boil let it reduce for about five to eight minutes or it's overdose by half and the bubbles look like this now for the sauce get a medium sauce pot add in a 15 ounce or 425 gram can of roasted crushed tomatoes turn the heat to medium high and reduce that for about five minutes now while that's reducing get three red bell peppers place them directly onto an open flame it's like that Chestnut song but I'm not going to say it monetization check good stuff rip your burner as hot as it'll go if you don't have a gas stove what do you do but the goal is to get it charred all over your pepper now pop that into a bowl cover with plastic wrap lettuce it for five minutes then remove clean them all off take out the seeds then get yourself a blender add your clean pepper flesh your crushed tomatoes four cloves of raw garlic half a cup or 75 grams of roasted almonds one tablespoon or 11 grams of Sherry vinegar one teaspoon or 4 grams of smoked paprika half a teaspoon or two grams of cayenne powder pop on your lid and blend that on high until it is as smooth as you can physically get it but hold on Buddy to get it even smoother than going to stream in to emulsify half a cup plus two tablespoons or 115 grams of extra virgin olive oil let it blend it should get nice and clean pour that a new bowl I just salt levels as needed and that's essentially a romesco inspired tomato sauce which I guess is basically what romesco is this is not normally how it would make it hey tastes great now I want you to lay back and prepare yourself you see this is a whole leg of the finest most expensive most rare money can buy hamon's kind of like prosciutto but it's made with a specific kind of Iberico piggy wiggy and is aged for four years the whole leg alone totals up to one thousand dollars breaking it down requires some skill first we're gonna cut close to the shank down and then starting from the meat and being careful not to remove too much meat you're gonna cut towards that to create sort of a check mark shaped chunk pull that out and now you have the room that you need to slice but before you do that trim up any yellow excess fat or skin until you start to reveal some white fat I'm cutting only the amount of fat that I want for how deep that I'm going to slice now I'm not going to slice this whole thing but get yourself a proper Jamon slicing knife and as thinly as you can enjoy every little slice now I'm about to do something that I've never done before and to be frank I kind of hate but you know what I thought in the spirit of fun we're gonna make this special and well as expensive as we possibly can how do we do that well we wrap each individual hand sliced Jamon by Yours Truly in an individual piece of 24 karat gold now if that isn't stupid then I don't know what is now there's probably two parties of you right now one is saying Josh this is ridiculous but I love it and the other ones like Josh you've broken every written culinary commandment just now how could you do this to me and to you I say I'm sorry look enough talk let's assemble this and see this thing again shape your dough around the same size 13 to 14 inches really stretch that bad boy out keep that crust thin but not too thin add in your sauce spread it beautifully then we're gonna sprinkle on a generous amount of freshly grated smoked skamorza cheese this is a southern Italian cow's milk cheese the tongue left to dry and sometimes smoked anyway put that into a proper Pizza Oven set to around 700 degrees Fahrenheit cook for 25 seconds quarter turn and cook for another 25 to 35 seconds pull out your beautifully burnished pizza and prepare to top it first a nice fresh grating of Parmigiano-Reggiano followed by a generous drizzle of your most expensive vinegar glaze and hold on we got something else here you ever seen fresh hearts of palm probably not here I have fresh hearts of palm very thinly mandolin salt to taste olive oil lemon juice sprinkle that on some freshly torn basil leaves now depending on the seasonality these very thinly sliced black truffle a whole miniature tin of the finest caviar and last but certainly not least your gold-plated jamone if I'm being frank here looking at this pizza it does not look like it should be eaten but you know what we're gonna take one for the team here let's taste test and find our winner all right we got two pizzas a New York style sort of and one that I hate something about this is not right but I'm doing it for science expensive science we'll start with uh Mr basic I'm goddamn cold I mean it tastes like pizza what do you expect it's good though now this on the other hand yeah drum roll going [Music] I'm kind of shocked right now I think this is one of the best pizzas we've ever made on this channel it's Smoky salty balanced there's Sweetness in there there's there's acidity is the gold necessary no if you make this pizza you're eating gold it's the highest level of Flex if I had to pick a winner out of these two pizzas this is ultimately the winner but there's a big barrier of Entry which is this but you want to know what has no barrier entry b-roll [Music] foreign [Music]

you could be paying this that is but cheaper [Music] Chicken and Waffles are something that you could find in most U.S states especially in the southern region of America but you could be paying up to 20 I think it's worth 20 but at the same time it does not need to cost that at all and you're often just getting literally basic buttermilk fried chicken a basic waffle and syrup boring I like something a little bit more special I want something a little more special you'd have to pay for that too usually but not here so with all that being said let's make this shall we look it's not easy to make chicken waffles cheap all right we did everything we could problem number one waffle iron wow that's a big issue right kind of stands in the way of making a goddamn waffle I have some options for you for one well you could use a waffle iron if you have one they do make cheap ones and the cheap ones Well they suck another option is to pour it into a grill pan which sort of gives you the same Vibe medium heat grease of a nice grill pan ideally you want it non-stick leave it on medium heat once it's hot pour in your batter let it kind of coat the edges and you're gonna flip it like a pancake look I get it it's not that great but I do have an alternative the trick with that is something I'll show you in a second first we make our waffle batter medium sized Bowl add in two cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour two tablespoons or 24 grams of white sugar half teaspoon 2 grams of fine sea salt 1 tablespoon or 10 grams of baking powder whisk all that together until thoroughly combined then add in a separate Bowl two whole eggs whisk in half a cup or 102 grams of vegetable oil one and three quarters of a cup or 415 milliliters of whole milk whisk all those items together until smooth and homogeneous pour your wet batter into your dry while constantly mixing continue mixing until you get a nice smooth batter add a touch of salt whisk that in and it's time so obviously if you're using waffle maker you grease it up and you cook it according to the package directions it's all automated there's really not that much you need to do just don't leave it in too long ruin it now the other option is to funnel cake your waffles that's right fill a six to eight quart heavy bottom pot with vegetable oil heat that to 350 Fahrenheit and then separately using either a plastic bag or a Piping Bag or whatever kind of plastic you got snip the tip and then pipe it a nice zigzag crisscross pattern of your batter into your hot oil obviously don't use all of your batter let that fry till it starts to stiffen flip and Fry the other side about two minutes per side pull it out drain in a wire rack and that is well your makeshift funnel cake waffle well you got a problem with that no obviously you don't really need butter but you will serve it with maple syrup now let's talk chicken I only want drumsticks hey they're absolutely iconic I mean look at this thing so in a large bowl I have one and a half cups or 350 milliliters of Buttermilk optionally three tablespoons or 32 grams of pickle juice two teaspoons or five grams of paprika two teaspoons or seven grams of kosher salt puts together till combined and optionally one teaspoon or six grams of the Holy ingredient we all know and love as MSG then mix the msgn praise be let us rejoice in the presence of MSG and Shout out now place all your chicken in there toss the coat and set to the side for your dredge you'll need another large bowl two cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons or seven grams of salt one tablespoon or 30 grams of garlic powder half a teaspoon or 2 grams of onion powder one teaspoon or three grams of paprika one teaspoon or two grams of optional celery powder one teaspoon or six grams of optional MSG stir to combine and all you gotta do is get that same pot of oil that you were using earlier if you made your funnel cakes or you know you can just the same thing 67 chords fill it up halfway heated to 350 really simple now while that's heating dredge your chicken now what do we know about our technique about getting flaky chicken right it's not just buttermilk it's the little flecks of liquid that combine with the flour to make little balls and then those little balls get flattened up against the chicken and those little flattened balls turn into beautiful so flick a little bit of your marinade into your flower dredge Stir It Up and then add your chicken in batches while aggressively squeezing the flour into your chicken making sure every crevice is filled don't be naughty place it on a baking sheet and repeat with the rest look at all my boys they're together they're looking beautiful isn't it nice now let's treat them with love and in batches drop them into scorching scaringly hot fiery oil maybe not fiery that's a hazard in the household actually starting with three to four drumsticks in your oil temperature drop to around 310 325 and you want to hold it at that temperature for five to eight minutes until your chicken is fried crispy golden brown and the internal temperature reads 165 degrees Fahrenheit while that's frying though yeah sure Chicken and Waffles are great but we'll go to Nashville hot inspired chicken and waffle and it's cheaper get a medium-sized Bowl this whole thing is optional but I really recommend it one tablespoon or 15 grams granulated sugar two teaspoons or seven grams of kosher salt two teaspoons or five grams of paprika one tablespoon or 13 grams of garlic powder add three tablespoons or 30 grams of cayenne powder half a teaspoon or 5 grams of onion powder 1 teaspoon or 5 grams of MSG there's a lot in here I don't know I know let's go back together and then pour in one cup or 240 milliliters of your hot oil directly from your hot fryer being careful please whisking it in and you have a beautiful Nashville hot oil then once your chicken is done carefully remove and immediately dunk in your natural hot oil coating every single little Nook cranny of crispy spicy goodness please don't know why rack to drain and repeat with the rest of your beautiful chicken now look once that's all done there's not really a whole lot that needs to happen you get your waffle or your funnel waffle or your grill pan waffle or just about any waffle you ideally made from this whole video here carefully lay atop your beautiful tender juicy crispy legs are we talking about chicken here what am I talking about add on anything else your heart desires you want to throw on some butter you want to throw on some fancy maple syrup or maybe you want honey that's fine drizzle some fresh Wildflower honey you got a local person down the road selling honey for a good price go give them a kiss on the cheek buy yourself some honey and let's taste this goodness gracious this isn't just Chicken and Waffles it's Nashville Hot Chicken on a waffle and it's that price we've already won we don't even need to taste it so [Applause] hey Kendrick okay this is so good I have to bring in Kevin who says he loves natural Hot Chicken as well as I'm Batman are you I'm in Disguise don't worry there's your chicken leg Kendrick stop performing magic stop performing magic Kendrick this is incredible dripping all over your exposed toes no regrets bye Kevin this chicken's so gut dang good I forgot I eat the goddamn waffle I how does it taste it tastes like I gotta replace my drawers right now because that's sort of like moist spongy inside a little crispy on the outside chewy on the inside the spice the sweetness the richness and it's also balanced at the same time I have nothing else left to say you know what I do want to say b-roll [Music] please foreign [Music]

the shack Burger potato buns cheesy patties tomato lettuce Jack sauce simple but beautiful for the first time I bought better history I'm sitting next to one of the creators of the item we're making I love Shake Shack and I love you mark as this tradition we gotta go out get it bring it back and remake it so with all that being said let's make this shall we now wait a minute Josh I'm not gonna have you go to a Shake Shack drive back here wait like 20 minutes to eat it I want to cook a fresh one for you man I want you to suit up let's go getting the bun nice and toasted is part of the magic almost like a french toast Vibe yeah potato bun just soaks it all up just gonna sit there and stare at a bun but I can't stare at anything you can smell and hopefully you're it's gonna help you pick up some of our tricks here you know what's funny Mark I always think back to my fine dining Roots whenever I'm making a butt better recipe I'm looking at each individual ingredient and how do I maximize that how do I maximize my technique if you feel like that was also an implication when you guys were developing Shake Shack oh 100 that's the only way we knew how to do we were born out of a Restaurant Group all the restaurants before Shake Shack were fine dining the way we cook our Burgers how we grind the meat we were just thinking through the fine dining lens put our sauce I'm gonna put our lesson tomato on there the idea is nothing waits for the burger when the Burger's done it's hot it's juicy it's like bubbling the cheese is molten it's the best experience last question round for yeah go for it so what's the burger capital of the United States okay a lot of burgers cultures from all over the country east coast and over the country we're tiptoeing around it Mark because I live in LA right now I'm going to say L.A but New York City is no slouch that's where Shake Shack is born on that's where all of our history comes from I mean come on La some of the most famous ones in the world come from L.A do you go to other burger places ever I'm a fan I'm a fan of the art of the burger and anywhere where I travel I try to find someone doing a little different that kind of hopefully will inspire me smells great it felt a little warm over here what's going on all right what's going on she's going down all right so patties are ready cheese is well melted here put it right on the bun again the bun is ready to go we have all the toppings and all I'm gonna do is shut this guy and it's done you're speaking volumes with just a few great ingredients that beef blend whole muscle ground fresh get that caramelization which makes a simple Burger really sick and that's the beauty of a burger really is the adventure to get there but more specifically eating it I know this is going to be a great burger Mark we're friends so I mean I already don't have anything bad to say about this bird if anything I'm actually nervous about mine I mean look at this picture perfect burger I'm sick and tired people not just taking a little bit of time to make it look nice Mark makes it look nice it's a simple Burger but hopefully it's going to hit you oh it's gonna hit I know it is oh oh that's great wow this is balanced buns are like soft but they still have like a little bit of that chewing that stick to your teeth too yeah the perfect amount of socks he puts it on there he's got the crispness on the outside this is a great oh wait why am I saying all this I'm supposed to be talking about uh look I I I don't have anything bad to say the only thing I can do is fight for my life let's begin this is the simplest Burger we've ever made on but better if that ain't special I don't know what is now these buns are different these have to be potato buns something I've avoided doing for a long time first let him baking sheet with parchment paper in the bowl of stand mixer add three and a quarter cup or 487 grams of all-purpose flour a quarter cup or 51 grams of potato flour one and a half tablespoons or 10 grams of dry milk powder a quarter teaspoon or less than a gram of amylase which is totally optional but it gives it that two and a half tablespoons or 45 grams of granulated sugar one and three quarters of a teaspoon or seven grams of fine sea salt mix together chocolate mine and then separately you're gonna waste two and a half teaspoons or 10 grams of instant yeast into one and a quarter cup plus two and a half tablespoons or 300 grams of water that's around 90 degrees Fahrenheit once it's dissolved add one whole egg pop it on your stand mixer tune your stand mixer to medium low and add [Music] stir for two to three minutes until it starts to smooth out a bit then add three and a half tablespoons or 56 grams of softened unsalted butter mix for another two to three minutes or until you have a beautiful Supple dough pop that into a large grease Bowl cover with plastic wrap and let that rise for one hour punch it down to degas completely divided to eight even pieces that are around 120 grams each cheap into three balls place them onto a baking sheet blend with parchment paper and cover with greased plastic wrap and proof for about 30 to 45 minutes once that's done get yourself some egg wash by mixing together one egg and one tablespoon or 15 grams of water once that's homages rusher-proof buns with egg wash and placed into ovens at the 375 Fahrenheit for 15 to 17 minutes pull them out and they're done optionally you can brush it with melted butter but hey these are beautiful on their own all right we're actually almost done we'll make our Shack sauce and then assemble look Mark gets it sauce is the boss so small bowl add in one cup or 220 grams of mayonnaise ideally homemade right that's always better the third cup or 78 grams of ketchup half a cup or 125 grams of yellow mustard specifically personal preference but you could also use Dijon one kosher dill pickle very finely diced I don't think they put this in there but you know what I feel right about it about two to three tablespoons of very finely diced more specifically brunoise also they don't put that in there half a teaspoon or half a gram of paprika a pitch of cayenne two cloves of garlic grated fresh and salt to taste mix all that together and you have a beautiful sauce all right we're ready let's make this easy you're gonna need one and a half pounds or 680 grams of fatty ground beef please none of the 80 lean BS to get that optimal crisp crust but juicy now take your beef and roll it into two and a half ounce balls you'll get about 10 of those which is perfect for Five Burgers get a stainless steel pan eat it over medium high very gently grease that bad boy now once that's hot pot like potato add in one bowl and using the back of a spatula or Burger press press that down until a quarter of an inch thick the cheese and immediately salt pepper to taste let that sear for about a minute or two scrape under there try to get that Whole Crust flip season lightly again with salt and pepper to taste and place on one slice of American cheese now separately we have two buns which have been sliced in half and toasted beautifully on both cut sides while that cheese is melting I'm gonna go ahead and sauce both of my top and bottom bun beautifully go generous here please don't go light now once your cheese is melted place your first Patty down Place another ball in your pan press it sear it flip one slice of white cheddar or another slice of American cheese let that melt place it on top of the other Patty and finish by adding one beautiful half inch thick slice of the finest tomato seasoned with salt on both sides please and finally one gorgeous bouncy Leaf of green leaf lettuce Crown your king and well you know this looks like a beautiful burger and so does marks but at the end of the day I want to see how this goes final taste round today Mark the man himself is gonna give the verdict on my burger and we have two taste testers is there a winner all I know is that there is a prize okay I just have to admire this this beauty we have right here I'm pretty excited to try yours I like how the bun looks the patties look beautifully seared this is a burger professional analyzing here this is definitely I think in the family thank you really good try from you here a few things that just popped out to me right away if we're trying to match Patty's here to me are a little thin bun is a little dense too yeah and I think that's it for me like the ratios but I think like the lettuce the Tomato the cheese everything it's in the family so the sauce it has a punch to its 10 you want to think of Shack sauce first thing comes to Maya's tank and you hit the tag it's got the elements I think there's actually a good bounce because again it's hitting a lot of my palate in different places you did a great job here man but I I'm still going to go with this one that does make sense I'll give you that all right Pano's in case test Numero Uno am I eating it right ah number two I'm choosing number one I thought the first one was a little bit more well-rounded out the layering the flavoring but I did like the Buns on the second one better damn that hurts Bittersweet that was a Bittersweet one right there Kevin the man with the most rizz number one rabbit do you kind of get what's going on there do I eat it or no all right Jesus Christ okay if you like that I love it pretty dang good huh number two no please don't do the whole thing action why you gotta eat it so weird man see this is this process I'm gonna respect it those were both excellent Burgers but number one felt a little bit better to me they were both excellent that's it was very close number one felt a little bit easier to go down though the bathroom's that way so it's a tie it's a beautiful time to love Burgers but what's the moral of the story the moral of the story is you use good ingredients you make it from scratch with intention with love with the things that you like that's what it's all about and that's what Shake Shack's about so mark thank you for coming Shake Shack thank you for supporting us we'll continue to support you but until next time you want to know what else we support around here b-roll [Music] thank you [Music]

some out there that some might say are life-changing [Music] okay so today we are making three well four technically different Mochi snacks typically when we think of Mochi we think Mochi ice cream but it's the Mochi that makes it so incredible so why wouldn't we want to emphasize on that beautiful chewy voluptuous sensuous um so with all that being said let's let's make this shall we all right there's a lot of stuff here but they're all very easy to make first up mitsarashi Danga first we're gonna make the sauce in a pot add five tablespoons or 68 grams of granulated sugar two tablespoons or 30 grams of soy sauce one tablespoon or 18 grams of mirin one tablespoon or 15 grams of Sake 2 3 of a cup or 155 grams of water now heat that up once it starts to get hot whisk in two tablespoons or 16 grams of cornstarch continue heating whisking constantly and just like magic brother it becomes thicker than a bowl of oatmeal now optionally you can add a little splash of Dashi now for the actual rice cake get a large pot of water and bring that to a boil separately get a medium sized bowl and add dashinko flour which is just Japanese rice flour and sheer tomato flour which is glutinous rice flour or sweet rice flour with Kindle combined then add two thirds of a cup or 155 grams of warm water constantly mix and need until smooth cover and let that rest for about five minutes now cut your dough into 15 to 16 pieces about 25 grams each shape those in a big old balls and carefully drop those into boiling water until they begin to flow around two to four minutes pull them out immediately drop into a nice water bath until cool then to a skewer add three balls and then to serve these all you do is get a kitchen torch and lightly dry are one side drizzle with your warm sauce and that's it look these are fun you want to bite little pieces off the stick don't just eat the whole thing you'll find out why later then we have this insane cheesy one we're gonna do in a second but first let's talk potato Mochi wait a minute potato Mochi brother what in the hell is that let me explain something it's not quite Mochi as in made with rice instead we're using potato in place of rice to create a similar product but with a potatoey flavor so first you're gonna need one large Russet potato pop it into an oven set to 425 Fahrenheit for 45 minutes to one hour or until soft and beautiful cool that completely remove the Skins place in a medium-sized mixing bowl and mash until it's fine as possible now season that tastes with salt followed by two tablespoons or 24 grams of potato starch hypothetically you could use tapioca but you know for obvious reasons potato starch mix then add two teaspoons or 10 grams of water and mix again until completely smooth cover that with plastic wrap and let that sit while we make our sauce small sauce pot add three tablespoons or 40 grams of sugar two tablespoons or 24 grams of soy sauce one tablespoon or 17 grams of mirin and one tablespoon or 14 grams of the Holy Grail of deliciousness shiridashi now mix and heat till the sugar is dissolved in your sausage done now back to your potato Mochi take your potato Mochi dough cut into seven to eight pieces around 30 grams each shape each piece into a nice thick disc like this get some Nori and cut out some small little belts now 12 inch non-stick pan brush the pan with enough vegetable oil to coat set to medium heat place on your Mochi and fry for three to five minutes per side or until beautifully golden brown on both sides once that's done brush one side lightly with your sauce flip it brush the other side and just keep flipping until they're caramelized and beautiful turn off the heat and wrap each little morsel with a nice Nori Belt look at it it's kind of cute right time for the moment you've all been waiting for and arguably my most favorite Mochi I have ever made hand fried Mochi now for the dough get yourself half a cup plus two tablespoons or 130 grams of hot hot water whiskey half a teaspoon or three grams of fine sea salt and two and a half teaspoons or 13 grams of granulated sugar until dissolved in a medium mixing bowl add one and a half cups or 225 grams of glutinous rice flour great brand would be like mochico flour now add your water mixture to your glutinous rice flour stir together with chopsticks and you can add a little bit more lukewarm water if needed just to bring it together then knead once it starts to get a little smooth add two and a half teaspoons or 10 grams of vegetable oil knead that in and continuously knead until smooth and beautiful cover that bad boy and let it rest for 15 minutes now plop your dough out divide that bad boy into 50 gram pieces which will get you about eight total pieces and now we're gonna fill these bad boys let's talk fillings yeah we got the pan-fried mozzarella stick version but what about a dumpling style also it helps with the people who are like oh I can't eat dairy so farty very simple you need either one large trumpet mushroom or a couple of shiitake mushrooms diced hit a medium sized pan over medium high add just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom add in your mushrooms and sear those bad boys for two to three minutes tossing occasionally until beautifully browned don't season them right away because they'll get all wet and yucky now move those bad boys to one side of the pan and add in six ounces or 170 grams of ground pork flatten it out for that full pan it's easy to taste with salt cereal pork until lightly browned flip and begin smashing to get that nice classic ground texture add a splash of water to deglaze stir together and pour into a bowl follow that immediately with two green onions thinly sliced 1 cup or 52 grams of green cabbage has been finely chopped season that lightly with salt squeezing aggressively to remove as much water from it it's not a necessity but it just kind of helps keep the mixture a little less watery followed by a half inch knob of Ginger grated 3 cloves of garlic finely chopped or grated one teaspoon or 5 grams of toasted sesame oil one tablespoon or 12 grams of soy sauce and optionally add one teaspoon or 4 grams of chili crisp stir that to combine and you have a dumpling filling now to fill this you're going to roll your Mochi dough into a rough disc it's about five inches wide dusting with rice flour as needed now place about one tablespoon of your dumpling mixture into the center of that disc fold the edges around to seal being very careful because this dough is delicate it will tear pinch and seal that shut then brush the smooth side with a little bit of water sprinkle on some sesame seeds and then heat a nonstick skillet over medium low with a little drizzle of oil place the Buns down in there cook for three to four minutes flip reduce the heat to low and cover with lid or foil and cook for three to four more minutes now if you press it and it bounces back immediately it's done that's it you can serve that with some spicy chili sauce or a glaze or just by itself but let's take this way further but if instead it looked like this a deep fried mozzarella stick version to make this you're going to use the same exact dough rolled out into a circle but this time I'm going to take a nice block of mozzarella and using a one to one and a half inch cylinder cutter Punch Out Circles of your mozzarella and make sure that each of those circles are about a half an inch thick pop into the center of your dough wrap it up seal it and then to really amplify that crunch toss in a little bit of all-purpose flour then into two eggs that have been beaten together and finally coat every single edge with panko bread crumbs and to fry carefully drop that into a heavy bottom six to seven quart pot filled about halfway the vegetable oil that's been heated to 350 Fahrenheit starting with three Mochi at a time and fry for about two minutes or until a crispy beautiful golden brown good Lord now

home but better not just the Popeye sandwich this is their classic meals it's gonna come with all sorts of different things kind of like the KFC bucket meal but it's the Popeyes version of it pretty straightforward right we got macaroni and cheese red beans and rice chicken so with all that being said let's make this shall we we're here I like how the sign says Popeyes and then just like who can die why is this guy what all right we're doing our three-point test this is our first time back to Popeyes we've done this first off building I hate the design but it's clean it's tidy five out of ten menu because of its Simplicity 8 out of 10 but that's not for the food though but I kind of have to wait for the customer service I can already tell can I just get a chicken with uh uh yeah cool thank you thank you well we got the bag I mean it's like 20 minutes restaurants get busy I get it I just hated that experience good Lord all right so we've got the back a whole lot of stuff in here is this what you want it's not that bad uh okay the biscuits these are like clap you've seen those tick tocks where people are like eating blocks of like dried cornstarch that's what that is all right chicken is it me or is this just like Loki burnt I like a leg you know I like a nice leg the face is all right Skin's super Chewy though there's not much going on all right red beans and rice something that you cannot mess with it doesn't smell bad actually it smells all right good Lord it tastes like it wanted to be good I definitely don't want another bite Yuma wanted to taste these he for some reason is really excited about seeing if they're good or not so you might come and give these a try all in all this is not a justifiable expense we can do much better so let's do that we're gonna start with red beans and rice oh Josh that's not very fun listen this might be one of the best spoonfuls of Sweet Southern goodness that you ever put in your mouth plus it takes a while so we gotta start here so in a large pot and I mean big and then three tablespoons or 52 grams of bacon fat or lard instead of a medium heat and once that's melted in add in one yellow onion diced one green bell pepper diced four cloves of garlic rough chopped a little bit of salt and pepper to taste stir and saute and once it begins to soften add one and a half tablespoons or 14 grams of your Creole seasoning of choice one tablespoon or four grams of smoked paprika two teaspoons or four grams of cayenne saute that just until it starts to get a little fragrant then add eight cups or about 2 liters of filtered water follow that with one pound or 450 grams of red beans followed by two smoked ham hocks consisting of four sprigs of fresh thyme and three sprigs of fresh Sage you tie that together with a little bit of kitchen twine make a nice little bow and look at that so anyway pop that in pull by two bay leaves bring that up to a boil and simmer that for three hours once that's done simmering add in two ribs of celery rough chopped and one pounder 450 grams terms of andouille sausage cut into bite-sized pieces bring that up to a simmer and cook for 45 to 60 more minutes your beans should be cooked all the way through it should be salty Smoky beautiful and ready to be used next we have biscuits so first in a food processor add two and a half cups or 375 grams of all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon or 5 grams of fine sea salt three and a half tablespoons or 42 grams of granulated sugar half a teaspoon or 3 grams of cream of tartar 4 teaspoons or 22 grams of baking powder lid on and pulse a few times one and a quarter cup or 280 grams of unsalted cold butter it has to be cold if you want good biscuits that's just going to get you the flakes and we're not talking about your friend that never shows up I'm talking about layers impulse until the goddang kales come home more specifically until you get little peace pour that into a bowl then using a fork mix in one cup or 226 grams of ice cold buttermilk once that begins to form a dough pour your scraggly looking dough onto a work surface and gently and quickly knead until it just barely comes together listen the more you touch your dough the more you ruin your dough see where I'm going with that now dusting with flour is necessary roll your dough out into a rough rectangle fold it like a letter roll it out again fold it once more like a letter and then roll one more time until you get a rough rectangle that's about three quarters of an inch thick using a round or fluted biscuit cutter cut out all your biscuits listen to a parchment lined baking sheet brush the tops of each of your biscuits with additional buttermilk lightly and place in a hot oven set to 450 degrees Fahrenheit or 230 Celsius make those bad boys for 15 to 20 minutes and while those are baking this is not a necessity but hey it's real nice get a small pot or pan add in three tablespoons or 57 grams of Honey heat that over medium until just hot and steamy but not boiling turn off the heat and whisk it in a quarter cup or 56 grams of cold salted butter not unsalted continuously whisk until it's beautifully emulsified and you have a salted honey butter topping now once your biscuits come out they should look lovely and ready to get a nice of your honey butter topping and cool in a wire rack next mac and cheese we did this a million times so I'll make it quick and this one's a wee bit different bring a large pot of water to a boil season generously with salt one pound or 450 grams of macaroni and cook just until Al Dente or you know follow the package directions once your macaroni is done strain it and then in a pot add a third cup or 76 grams of unsalted butter instead of our medium heat and once your butter is melted and bubbling add in a third cup or 50 grams of all-purpose flour whisking or stirring constantly and let that cook for about 45 seconds to a minute then whisk in one and three quarters of a cup or 315 milliliters of whole milk in a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of heavy cream whisk that together and look if it starts to thicken a little too much depending on your flour you can always add additional milk if needed now once you have a velvety smooth beautiful Bechamel you'll then cut off the heat and stir in 5 ounces or 141 grams of fresh grated sharp cheddar 3 ounces or 85 grams of fresh grated gouda or technically it's pronounced howda a little bit of salt to taste optionally a little pinch of onion powder and what's that bad boy is as smooth as physically possible with no chunks of cheese please add in your hot macaroni stir together for a little symphony and finally once it's all done stir in two cloves of garlic very finely chopped now keep that bad boy hot in order to serve all right the Moment of Truth sure we got our biscuits our mac and cheese red beans and rice but don't you think that I forgot about the chicken first the chicken dip which you can use as a marinade but honestly you actually don't need to marinate it at all first you need a large bowl add in two cups or 475 milliliters of Buttermilk a quarter cup of 60 milliliters of dill pickle juice two and a half teaspoons or 14 grams of kosher salt one teaspoon or 5 grams of MSG two teaspoons or two grams of paprika one tablespoon or 9 grams of garlic powder half a teaspoon or half a gram of onion powder one teaspoon or 4 grams of your Creole seasoning of choice little splash of hot sauce whisk together now add in two chicken thighs two drumsticks and two wings oh wait that's not eight and two of whatever the hell else you want you want more drumsticks cool there you go look the main thing is you want eight pieces please just pick dark meat okay there's not much point to the breast here and once all of your chicken is saturated with your dip get a separate large bowl and add in three cups or 450 grams of all-purpose flour one and a half teaspoons or seven grams of MSG half a teaspoon or half a gram onion powder two and a half teaspoons or six grams of garlic powder half a teaspoon half a gram of ground white pepper one teaspoon or 4 grams of that same Creole seasoning you used earlier and one tablespoon or 7 grams of kosher salt which together until thoroughly combined you've seen chicken breaded before you take the chicken from the wet you add it to the dry and you aggressively press the dry into it make sure that brother it is covering every little crevice take it out shake out the excess flour and guess what keep the oil is about 350 Fahrenheit add in half of your breaded chicken and you're obviously going to fry this into two separate batches now what will happen is that oil should drop to around 300 to 325 degrees Fahrenheit listen carefully this is an important element to Frying great Fried Chicken hold the temperature around that 325 Zone don't let it go back up to 350 it's going to get too dark the goal is to get the chicken to cook all the way through to the bone while maintaining crispiness and without going too dark now once an internal temperature of 165 is reached and you have a exterior you pull it out let it drain and cool slightly I think it's chicken time now let's see how we did let's do this you need to hear this actually managed to match what Popeyes tastes like but this is cleaner mac and cheese no competition red beans and rice Smoky rich but the biscuits the best biscuits we've ever made on this channel you see that I'm calling us a winner but let's do a taste test Kendrick is up it's been a while come on in pal you ready number one number two at the first one obviously God that first one's way better that honey that honey that's the key right there number one it's a little gritty oh my goodness that spice just kicks you right in the throat and it's refreshing mac and cheese time this one I'm interested to see how this goes they're kind of similar I'm gonna say number two on this one because there's a lot more cheese last is chicken that's number one um I already know which one this is number two wow I'm sorry Popeyes I'm going with number two that was some good chicken Josh and I say that as a person who's eating chicken a lot take that however you want you can find a little bit more of that salty Savory flavor and the crunch the crunch is what took it over how can you have fried chicken without crunch that's not what you want but you know what you do want beet roll [Music] [Music] thank you

you're gonna want to start with this one [Music] okay so today we are making Biryani if you've never had it before you're in for a freaking treat buddy it's Rich it's salty it's got meat so many textures and it's so fragrant you might as well Sprout wings and fly off into the clouds you're like that could be you eating this so with all that being said let's make this shall we right so there's about a billion different kinds of Biryani maybe not a billion but this is the one that many people imagine and it's called hide your body Biryani it's also one of Papa's despite the number of ingredients it's actually pretty easy first we're making our own Biryani Masala powder don't be a little baby okay make your own first get a small sheet tray add a quarter cup or 21 grams of coriander seeds two tablespoons or 13 grams of shot jira which is just black cumin seed two teaspoons or four grams of cloves 10 green cardamom pods two black cardamom pods two star anise I need to take a breath here two teaspoons or five grams of fennel seeds one teaspoon or four grams of black peppercorns and three cinnamon sticks pop that into an oven that's been preheated to 350 Fahrenheit for about five to seven minutes or until toasted sure you can pop this right into your blender but you're gonna eviscerate it instead of recommend lightly crushing that either in a mortar and pestle or you can put it in a bag and hit it with a pan or something I don't know just break it down now pop that into your blender followed by one bay leaf half a teaspoon which is slightly under a gram of fresh ground nutmeg one teaspoon or three grams of ground mace blend on high until smooth as possible then sift the restrainer to get it as fine as possible done moving on to our dahi Chutney I mean come on look at this thing it's more vibrant green than beautiful flower again blender rough chop three green chilies Thai chilies totally work here pop those into your blender followed by one inch knob of Ginger chopped four cloves of garlic 1 cup or 11 grams of cilantro third cup or 4 grams of fresh mint by the way don't do any of that dried okay just throw it out the window a pinch of Masala powder a pitch of cumin powder salt to taste and finally three quarters of a cup or 180 grams of a nice thick yogurt blend on high still relatively smooth pour into a bowl and add additional self to taste if needed it's something beautiful right there alright last but very important thing before we get into it right time very easy medium Bowl add three quarters of a cup or 180 grams of plain yogurt by the way this is all full fat I don't want any of that low fat stuff please two tablespoons which is about a gram of chopped fresh cilantro half a teaspoon or one gram of ground cumin a quarter teaspoon or half a gram of ground coriander and a half a cup or 66 grams of a seedless English cucumber that's been grated and lightly salted and drained of its excess water that's optional but I like to do it season it taste of salt give it a nice mix soak of mine and then finally fold in two tablespoons or 21 grams of diced red onion and lemon juice to taste for flavor and consistency now listen the consistency of this really depends on the type of yogurt that you use the thicker the yogurt the thicker the right to see where I'm going here now we're ready to make first we marinate our chicken now large bowl you're gonna need one powder 450 grams of chicken drumsticks which is gonna be around four or five depends on how thick that chicken is two garlic cloves grated a two inch piece of Ginger grated two thirds of a cup or 157 grams of yogurt one and a half teaspoons or four grams of your Biryani Masala powder that you made earlier quarter teaspoon or half a gram of turmeric powder two teaspoons or one gram of red chili powder you can totally use paprika that's fine three quarters of a teaspoon or one gram of green cardamom powder one and a half teaspoons or nine grams of fine sea salt two Indian green chilies which like I said Thai chili is totally fine finely chopped two teaspoons or nine grams of lemon juice mix all together to coat thoroughly and optional you can marinate overnight or you can use it right away it's up to you I know it's a marinade so maybe marinated fried onion seems like it doesn't belong right but it does first you're gonna need one and a half large yellow onions cut the tops I sit in half and the Rudolph peel and then slice it a quarter inch or slightly thinner if possible via a mandolin now look you could do this with a knife I really recommend the mainland so they fry evenly now in a 12 inch saute pan at three cups or 700 milliliters of vegetable oil heat over medium until it's around 325 then add in your onions into batches and Fry stirring occasionally until crisp light in golden brown turned on a wire rack or a paper towel teasing gently with salt and that's it now time for our rice very important here first you're gonna get one and a half cups or 286 grams of aged basmati rice please listen don't just go and just pick some random basmati rice oh no big deal no do not do that please get the properly highest quality possible please now rinse your rice multiple times until the water runs clear then let it sit soaking water for 30 minutes then gently drain it be careful not to break it up now medium-sized pot add in seven cups or 1.7 liters of water one black cardamom pod one star anise one bay leaf one cinnamon stick five green cardamom pods three quarters of a teaspoon one gram of shajira five whole cloves half a teaspoon or half a gram of ground mace one tablespoon or 11 grams of fine sea salt and just a tiny little bit of vegetable oil like a half teaspoon now bring that to a rolling boil once it's boiling I know this seems wrong but this is how it's done now add in your soaked basmati rice and let that cook till about 75 of the way done not all the way you want a little bit of rawness on the inside of that grain which is actually pretty fast it'll happen in like two to four minutes now while it's going your small pot add three and a half tablespoons 52 grams of milk and half a teaspoon or much less than a gram so you could just say a generous pinch I suppose oh saffron threads and set them to the side separately you're gonna need a thick bottom pot and an a light drizzle of vegetable oil in the bottom add your marinated chicken along with all of your marinade everything and I've got some different herbs for you here we've got a quarter cup or 12 grams a finely chopped mint and a third cup or 18 grams of finely chopped cilantro that's the whole amount now you're gonna take that and you're gonna add three quarters of your cilantro three quarters of your mint drizzle in two tablespoons or 27 grams of ghee just clarified butter all right don't you worry three quarters of your fried onions gently stir that together now before you add the rice make sure to taste it if it needs more salt it now if you don't salt it now it's not going to be salty enough later trust me not enough salt will ruin this then on top of that you're gonna add half your rice half your remaining amount of cilantro have your remaining amount of mint your fried onions a little bit more Biryani Masala light squeeze of half a lemon then add your second half of rice the remainder of your minted cilantro the remainder of your fried onion then ever so carefully drizzle on your saffron milk now optionally you can totally strain the saffron milk first if you want I prefer to anyway drizzle that on and finally drizzle on a quarter cup or 54 grams of melted ghee now there's a cooking method called dumb cooking I know that's what it's called and traditionally it's done with a very basic water dough that's then rolled into a rod and then they seal the pot with that you can totally do that and it works just fine it's just really messy so a lot of homes nowadays will just use a layer of foil in between the lid and the pot you close it and instead of putting this on a direct flame what you're going to do is get a cast iron heavy bottom pan your pot fits in set the flame to medium high so it reaches just over the diameter of the pot cook them for 15 minutes then reduce the temp to low do not take the lid off and cook for 20 to 30 more minutes that's it at this point your Biryani should be done the bottom should be beautifully cooked with a light Char on your chicken gently stir everything together being careful not to rip up your chicken and gently take out those succulent fall off the bone pieces Papa don't know will play beautifully add some additional cilantro or fried onion for garnish which you might not have it's fine insert with your Chutney and raita and let's taste test and see how we did Biryani feel good about it oh see how do you eat it though you know you get a little bit of rice a little bit of chicken wow it's clean it's fragrant multiple spices in your face and it's now a little bit of this damn some of that ah do not make this without these sauces they're absolutely a requirement you need more salt than you think this could be salted a little bit better then just make sure that you're tasting as you go but you know what else you should do as you go watch b-roll [Music] foreign [Music] I actually almost passed out doing that that

[Music] we're making what I would consider an ideal American Chinese takeout meal inflation's real I'm sorry with the average Rising price of the Chinese takeout meal what was one stock to be this iconically cheap full of life Bountiful amounts of vegetables and meat and rice for something that was low cost and now it's this absurdity this needs no further explanation so let's make this shall we all right first and foremost let's start with the rice two cups or 380 grams of white rice ideally medium grain do I even have to say it anymore just wash it you cook that with whatever you got but we all know the right way is with the rice cooker which if you're using one it would be two cups or 473 milliliters of water close it press the on button and you're done next up Kung Pao Pork first you're gonna need one pound or 450 grams a boneless Boston butt slice that bad boy thinly about a third of an inch thick toss it into a medium bowl season lightly with salt and now one and a quarter tablespoon or 11 grams of cornstarch tossed together until fully coated then set to the side guess what brother you only need a second bowl Bing Bang Boom now today you're gonna add two tablespoons or 27 grams of sugar two tablespoons or 22 grams of white distilled vinegar a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of soy sauce so that together until the properties of solubility cause the sugar to dissolve or some I don't know and finally whisk in one and a quarter tablespoon or 11 grams of cornstarch until dissolved all right it's walk time you don't get your walk hey then you can walk out of the building first enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom about two and a half tablespoons eat it for high heat and once that's add in your pork spread again evenly and let that sear for about two to three minutes tossing occasionally until you get some decent Browning now remove that add more oil and add one red bell pepper diced one green bell pepper diced two green onions cut into one inch segments seven garlic cloves finely chopped that's right seven a half inch knob of Ginger finely chopped season it takes with salt and stir fry that bad boy once it begins to soften if you want add one and a half teaspoons or four grams of red pepper flakes now home stretch once all that is nice and fragrant stir fry in half a cup or 64 grams of roasted peanuts add your pork back in stir fry that to heat it back up and finally pour in your sauce and stir fry aggressively to coat every little square inch little piece of yummy goodness and watch the magic happen as it thickens clings pump it into a ball look at that it's steaming in the distance all right next up orange chicken we've done this before but this one's a little bit different and by that I mean I had to figure out how to make it cheaper first we're gonna make our sauce get a medium sauce pot now in a third cup for 65 grams of light brown sugar followed by one cup or 240 milliliters of orange juice instead of a medium heat stirring occasionally once that comes to a simmer let that reduce for about two minutes and add one teaspoon or two grams of red pepper flakes that's totally optional it's for heat and it will be spicy a half inch knob of Ginger grated half a cup or 120 milliliters of soy sauce then separately mix together one tablespoon or nine grams of cornstarch and one tablespoon or 15 grams of water until you get that good old slurry whisk in your slurry a little splash at a time until it's to your desired thickness now you can use all of it and it'll be really thick or you can use half of it and it'll be a little more runny it's really up to you turn off the heat optionally strain your sauce and finish with six cloves of garlic very finely chopped and your sauce is done now for the fry get one and a half pounds or 680 grams of chicken thighs boneless and skinless cut those into bite size pieces then in a medium sized Bowl add in two eggs three tablespoons or 48 grams of water little splash of soy sauce optionally a couple tablespoons of sriracha whisk together until homogeneous add in your chicken move on immediately to your dredge which is just gonna be a large bowl for tossing so do that at three quarters of a cup or 112 grams of all-purpose flour three quarters of a teaspoon or six grams of fine sea salt and a quarter cup or 33 grams of cornstarch whisk together and look frying is super easy when you use a wok it heats up quickly and you don't need a ton of oil so get a large Wok fill it up about halfway with vegetable oil heat that to about 350 degrees Fahrenheit and take all of your chicken plop it into your dredge toss aggressively to coat every little then in two batches add your chicken to your fry oil and fry for about three to four minutes or until beautifully crispy and look at those little flakes and cook to an internal temperature of 165 Fahrenheit pop that into a bowl sauce with half of your sauce and repeat with the second batch that's it all right boom next up chow mein super simple medium sized Bowl add two tablespoons of 32 grams of soy sauce half a teaspoon or 2 grams of toasted sesame oil one tablespoon or 13 grams of granulated sugar and two teaspoons or six grams of cornstarch whisk all that together until combined and set to the side got a medium pot fill it with water and bring that to a boil now get a large Wok adjust enough oil to coat the bottom keep that over high heat and once that's ripping hot add four cups or 200 grams of thinly sliced green cabbage add in 1 julienne carrot season lightly with salt to taste and stir-fry that together until it starts to soften stir in two green onions two cloves of chopped garlic now you need to move quickly here you don't want those green onions get too cooked now to your boiling water add one pound or 450 grams of Chow Mein noodles and if they're fresh you're going to boil those for about 30 seconds immediately remove and add to your Wok sir for that flipping constantly and once that's hot and starts to get a little bit of color on your noodle pour in your sauce stir-fry and once it's glistening like the most beautiful mirror in robing each noodle it's done pop that onto a plate Bowl up your rice and look at that all for this measly price that's what I want to see when I get my Chinese takeout meal but is it as good let's find out we did not get this from this restaurant [Music] let's go putting it in this box made it feel like someone made it for me I was it I made it I'm gonna start with my favorite orange chicken unparalleled any other orange chicken on the market in most cases if you make orange chicken at home it's going to be better than takeout every single time no fail juicy that's the first off crunchy and yet delicate Kung Pao Pork you could do a chicken but I want a little bit of variety here right immediately better with pork a little spicy little salty tiny bit of sweetness and then the spice creeps up a little more rice I mean rice is nice we already know where it is about to go I have to change and of course ciao men looking lovely nudes do people still say that what do they say hello ladies I'm single that's not what they say this is not your personal advertisement noodles um the benefit of making your ears put in there but what's it like balanced chewy noodly but some vegetable freshness all in all this is a spectacular American Chinese takeout meal for this price that you can completely control but do you want to know what else you can control b-roll [Music] thank you [Music] this is

time we put them to the test [Music] today we're doing the katsu Sando versus the katsu zanda I'm sure you've seen these around somewhere right there are these perfect little square sandwiches with the edges cut off it's almost like the luxurious version of an uncrustable for an adult so we're going to turn that dial all the way up on the cheap version and all all the way up on what eventually priced out to be this with all that being said let's make this shall we here's our two competitors a classic poor katsu Sando and then an A5 katsu Sando with a pretty vastly different price point let's start with the cheaper version for bread any good fresh baked loaf of white bread more traditionally a Hokkaido milk bread will do sliced as evenly as you can now obviously a sloth is a necessity and if you don't like slaw then you're not allowed to have this sandwich I'm kidding I'll just judge you from afar first you need half ahead of green cabbage very thinly sliced ideally on a death machine sometimes called a mandolin three green onion thinly sliced two cloves of garlic grated the juice of one lemon salt and pepper to taste and a third cup are 68 grams of mayonnaise tossed together until combined give it a taste it's crunchy it's acidic it's got that slap in the face next tonkatsu sauce which you may have all the ingredients for already small sauce pot half a cup or 128 grams of ketchup three tablespoons or 40 grams of oyster sauce a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of Worcestershire sauce and 3 tablespoons or 42 grams of granulated sugar heat over medium while constantly stirring for about a minute or just until the sugars dissolve keep it refrigerated and enjoy on all fried good things for the pork you'll need a boneless pork chop obviously increase the amount based off of how many you're making you know one chop per Sando pound that bad boy out till it's about a half an inch thick and four to five inches wide these energies with salt on both sides and dredges the same on a classic katsu Bowl One all-purpose flour bowl two two to four eggs with a splash of water beaten together Bowl three Panko bread crumbs none of these ingredients need a specific amount you just need enough to coat the God dang thing now coat your chop in the flour shake out the excess then in the egg all around the chop in this little Grammy and finally in the panko pressing to adhere all over that bad boy you know this method works with just about everything you could cut through your dang Xbox controller if you really wanted to you could shell in front of these but I live in Texas so it's a legal obligation to deep fry heat a seven quart heavy bottom pot filled about halfway with oil heat 350 Fahrenheit and carefully lower your breaded chop and fry for three to five minutes or until a rich golden brown katsu that shines in the light hit that with a touch more salt while it's still piping hot and voila you're ready to assemble first you need two slices of your milk bread tonkatsu sauce on the bottom half Mayo on the top half add on your katsu a nice stack of your slaw and of course Crown your king but it doesn't stop there to keep the texture consistent throughout the whole sandwich so your inner child can Rejoice cut off the crust on every Edge to get as close to a perfect square as you can cut it in half and serve immediately let's switch this up how do we add cost here well for one we had to go buy a whole 19 ounce A5 Miyazaki wagyu strip loin steak now we'll come back to that our bread is built a little bit different here we have a black garlic Hokkaido milk bread using the same recipe for my cookbook first we gotta make a tangs on small saucepan a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of whole milk two tablespoons or 24 grams of water water and two tablespoons or 18 grams of all-purpose flour heat over medium stirring constantly until thicker than a bowl of oatmeal scrape into a container and cool completely while that's cooling get half a cup of 120 milliliters of hot steaming water add 1.5 teaspoons of saffron threads go for a generous pinch blend that with an immersion blender until well yellow like uh well you know what that looks like to that yield half a cup or 120 milliliters of whole milk which should bring the temperature down to around 95 degrees Fahrenheit but if it's still hot let it cool till lukewarm then whisk in two to half teaspoons or 9 grams of instant yeast still dissolved then beat in one large egg one egg yolk till homogeneous then in the bowl of a stand mixer add three and a half cups or 525 grams of bread flour 2 teaspoons or 5 grams of fine sea salt 3 tablespoons or 42 grams of granulated sugar and optionally 3 grams exactly of amylase enzyme mix all together pop into your stand mixer add your liquid add your tangs on put the speed for your dough hook set to medium and once you get a rough dough add in three tablespoons or 42 grams of softened salted butter a lot of mix for three to five minutes or until smooth and extensible dump it out and spread it into an unflowered work surface to get a rectangle roughly 6 by 10 inches squeeze up the cloves from one whole head of black garlic bread to black garlic all across the surface of your dough scrape up the edges with scraper hold the left towards the middle the right over that and then fold the top towards you slap it fold and knead the dough until homogeneous again form into a light ball and place into a greased Bowl cover with a plastic wrap overnight in the fridge Next Day punch that bad boy down divide it into two pieces roll each piece of dough into a rough rectangle about the same width as a 9x5 loaf pan roll it up into a log grease up your loaf pan with cooking spray add a new roll seam side up tent lightly with greased plastic wrap and proof for two hours or until the bread is just barely peeking over the top of your bread pan bake at 375 Fahrenheit for about 18 to 20 minutes or until a beautiful golden brown beefed loaf emerges baste your little gentleman with a little bit of melted butter if desired then cool completely on a wire rack with your bread turned on inside to keep the top domed until cooled to room temperature now if for some reason your bread didn't Bloom quite as nice as you want or your loaf pan was maybe a little too large you can always cut it lengthwise and then into individual squares out of the katsu sauce small saucepan two tablespoons or 25 grams of sake sets a medium high oil and reduced by half then add a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of Worcestershire sauce three tablespoons or two grams of Bonita flakes three tablespoons or 38 grams of oyster sauce 3 tbsp of 42 grams of sugar half a cup or 128 grams of ketchup stir and continue to heat until the sugar is dissolved pass it through a mesh strainer and you have a fresh campfire style tonkatsu sauce and guess what the slaw here again similar but mods large bowl half a head of green cabbage thinly sliced one very finely diced shallot one tablespoon or 18 grams of gochujang one tablespoon or 14 grams of spicy chili crisp all right we're stepping away from tradition here five cloves of garlic grated the juice of one lemon half a cup or 100 grams of kubi mayo stir together until beautifully combined adding salt if needed and your slaw has now appreciated in value making it not just a cabbage slaw but a financial asset alright we're ready to fry and assemble as you might have guessed the breading is the same if your steak is long then you might be able to get two good sandwich portions by trimming excess fat reserving that for the most amazing Tallow another time though and splitting your steak in half but do make sure your steak is at least three quarters of an inch thick or it will overcook in the fryer now season both sides generously with salt to taste and same as before coating the flour shake off the excess dip in the egg mixture cook completely and finally a thicko boy coating of Panko bread crumbs for others at 360 degrees Fahrenheit just until golden brown out you want to get color and crunch on this as fast as possible without burning the outside but simultaneously without overcooking the inside about two to three minutes well that's fine we're gonna quickly make the seasoning first a Yuzu Mist half a cup of 120 milliliters of Yuzu juice half a cup or 120 milliliters of shiradashi and one tablespoon or 14 grams of your finest aged soy sauce mixed together pour into a spray bottle with a Mist function and then for the spice mix Accenture to garashi small bowl two tablespoons or 19 grams of kosher salt one tablespoon of 9 grams of shimi tokorashi one and a half teaspoons or two grams of the more rare Sancho powder whisk that together until combined at this point the wagy boy should be done pull them out spray immediately two to three times ever so lightly with your Yuzu Mist followed by your sanchu togarashi to taste then to assemble get two good slices of your black garlic Hokkaido bread Smoky Bonito tonkatsu sauce on the bottom and koopy Mayo on the top lay down your Yuzu misted luxury brick top generously with your saw top with your other half in this time I chose not to trim because it was already quite symmetrical as it was and to be honest I didn't want to lose a single inch of that A5 wagyu but I will slice it in half for a beautiful cross section that I can feel the juice squirting all over the goddamn place but enough talk let's see if it's worth cracking open the piggy bank for this guy or if Old Reliable still does the trick got it now we've seen both of these sandwiches they're similar and yet very very different let's begin here pork katsu very basic very simple and it sure does make a delightful cross-section this is a sandwich I'm telling you you got the salt mommy meat but more specifically you have that beautiful crunch then you have the crunch of the Cabbage but there's some richness from the Mayo and you get that sweet little from the tonkatsu sauce this is such a balanced sandwich same thing here but we have A5 wagyu which is turning it all the way up the balance comes from this bread though it's got the sweetness that's really going to help cut the richness I mean it just makes sense it's too beautiful does that make it better or the only way we would find out let me tell you something I know we talk about oh you don't have to Shell out money all the time no no shut up shell it out for this this is a million miles I love Stark flavors super duper fatty rich but then you got that immediate sweet acidity that they're just fighting in your mouth they're having a battle but it's incredible about it you're just there sitting and watching the battle happen in front of you it doesn't get any more beautiful than that in this case absolutely spend the money on it I don't care what you say if you ever had this before it's gonna blow your goddamn mind just do me a favor and cook it medium rare but you want to know what else is medium rare b-roll foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]

and place into your oven at 375 Fahrenheit for 15 to 17 minutes or until a beautiful golden brown got dang Burger King bun practically exits your oven to Grace your presence optionally you can brush

making fried rice but not just any fried rice we've done that before okay it's easy today we're taking the two best fried rice in my book and putting them head to head and deciding which one is worth actually making but let's talk more action and let's make this shall we all right Old Faithful fried rice this is the one that most of us know Chinese style or specifically Yang Zhao style pronunciation meter check all right great and then there's Tai which is dope because I served it in a pineapple what more do you want me to say about that you're welcome let's start with the Chinese version First the fried rice foreign You Gotta Have It Let's Be poised here small bowl two tablespoons or 37 grams of soy sauce two teaspoons or seven grams of shaoxing rice wine one teaspoon of four grams of toasted sesame oil and a generous pinch or two of ground white pepper give it a little whisk now get yourself a beautiful walk add in two to three tablespoons of vegetable oil and heat that on high heat swirling occasionally now while it's getting hot start prepping your veg two small carrots very finely diced half a small yellow onion also finely diced and two cloves of garlic very finely chopped once your Wok is yodeling or very hot whichever comes first add your carrot onion and garlic season lightly with salt and stir-fry until your veg begins to soften about two minutes then they'll add six ounces or 170 grams of peeled and deveined shrimp that have been cut into half inch pieces stir fry until that's cooked through about three minutes and the next bit is totally optional but good it is good you're gonna add half a pound or 226 grams of cooked chashu pork that's been chopped into small cubes oh who has cooked turkey on here Josh well if you don't have it then don't add it anyway stir fry that until hot about one minute then add in four cups or 670 grams of cooked and chilled medium grain rice full pause I know what you want to do you want to just cook your rice and add it to the wok right away well I'll tell you one if you are going to use freshly cooked rice you might as well go home you're going to get clumpy fried rice it's all mushy gushy and no funny cooking and then chilling keeps the individual grains individual for the proper texture anyway stir fry all that together and once your rice is hot and beginning to crisp up lightly it's eggy-weggy time scoot everything over to one side fill that now open side with another two tablespoons of vegetable oil be two to three whole eggs together pour them into the empty side hit with a touch of salt and Scramble for one to two minutes or until cooked through chop that up using your Wok spoon then toss everything together and finally add in half a cup or 70 grams of frozen peas 3 green onion thinly sliced your sauce from earlier and stir fry until everything is Thoroughly Incorporated and you've got the classic fried rice Vibes just right turn the heat off stir in two additional cloves of finely chopped garlic pop into a bowl top with green onion and that's your fried rice time for Thai fried rice oh served in a pineapple what is this some sort of tourist trap look I just think the pineapple looks cool but it's about what's inside that counts so we worked to get this relatively traditional although not perfect first fried rice sauce small bowl add one and a half teaspoons or four grams of shrimp paste one tablespoon or 18 grams of fish sauce and two spoons or 12 grams of soy sauce mix together until combined now in a separate Bowl add one and a half teaspoons or 4 grams of granulated sugar three quarters of a teaspoon or 2 grams of white pepper and one and a half teaspoons or three grams of curry powder usually in Thai Cuisine Currys are made from a spice paste rather than a powder this isn't seen that often but it is seen in pineapple fried rice now onto what feels so wrong but also so right the pineapple Bowl first little pineapple clean in half oh real nice that was my favorite Leaf thanks Josh try to leave your leaves intact and scoop out the flesh to sort of make a bowl in the pineapple like this it doesn't have to be perfect but you know a basin feel free to use that flush that you scooped out for later in the recipe or just eat it let's jump to a quick quick nonpla sauce for serving first add two to three Thai chilies thinly sliced five cloves of garlic and least sliced either with a knife or if you want them consistent I recommend a finger death trap also called a two tablespoons or two grams of cilantro rough chopped one tablespoon or 90 grams of palm sugar that's been very finely chopped two and a half tablespoons or 40 grams of fish sauce and a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of lime juice mixed together and you have a fantasy land of balanced Funk salt acid sweet spice Umami next you'll need about 14 medium shrimp peeled and deveined cut into small pieces about little half inch chunk of rooneys and three quarters of a cup or 100 grams of cashews you can pop those in the oven set to 350 for about seven to ten minutes or until nicely toasted and let's stir fry this bad boy first walk add a couple tablespoons of oil coat the bottom heat over medium high add in two finely diced medium shallots and three cloves of thinly sliced garlic season lightly with salt and stir fry for about one minute until the veg starts to soften add in your shrimp stir fry for 2-3 minutes or until the shrimp is cooked through place that in a bowl set to the side add another two to three tablespoons of vegetable oil heat that until ripping hot then beat two to three large eggs together it's all homogeneous pour those in cooked and scramble until about two thirds of the way cooked chop it up then add in 4 cups or 560 grams of cooked and chilled jasmine rice not any other rice jasmine rice stir fry for another minute until the rice is heated through inserting to get a little bit of those crispy bits add in your spice mix from earlier followed by your sauce stir fry together until stained like fried rice Church glass in a way then add one cup of 213 grams of fresh diced pineapple fresh okay don't go to the store like oh I think I'll get the little can no Follow by three tablespoons or 45 grams of golden raisins put your shrimp back in there and stir fry that for about one minute until it starts to become a nice little happy family oh so sweet now turn that heat all the way off and add two thinly sliced green onions optionally one roma tomato finely diced I'm not a huge fan know the Tomato in there I've seen it used in some recipes not sure how common it is followed by your toasted cashews toss together until thoroughly combined and you're done right wrong the most important step pineapple Bowl feels wrong just looks good I can't help it stuck on your fried rice to create a beautiful domed top almost like the other half of your pineapple is breathing the Thai fried rice garnish with Thai Basil a little bit of cilantro if desired and that just looks glorious but let's not waste any time and see our winner two fried rice one man don't go to that website all right so we have the Chinese style me it's gonna be a hard battle I'll tell you what except for what does that taste like if you had fried rice it's classic salty Rich Umami and good next one first off the sauce beat that in there okay oh my God someone's calling me the verdict is in what's that day like this one has the whole rainbow salty sweet Umami a little spicy acid and herbaceous voting time I'm gonna keep this very basic if you're gonna make fried rice at home you gotta make both of these this is a perfect version of what we all love this is about it at midnight it's a new experience you choose it's up to you equally as easy but you want to know what else is easy b-roll foreign [Music]

large bowl add six cups plus a third cup or 950 grams of all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons or 25 grams of sugar 1 tablespoon and 90 grams of fine sea salt mixed together by hand then in a separate container you'll need two and a half cups or 617 grams of water at around 95 fahrenheit then add one and a half tablespoons or 14 grams of instant yeast mix together until dissolved then add your yeasty to the flour mix by hand get yourself some good old fashioned rhubarb method it's a mixing method don't worry you pick the dough up in a scooping motion you slap it against the side of the bowl rinse it from pink ding ding then once that's smooth about three to five minutes of mixing let that sit cover with plastic wrap give it a professional vibe nice and rise for one hour at room temp or till doubled then rip its face off punch it down oh so sad dump onto a lightly floured work surface and divide into 14 evenly sized pieces if you're anal like me that's 110 to 120 grams per piece roll into light balls place in a lightly floured proofing box or baking sheet cover lightly with greased plastic wrap or lid that won't touch the dough and proof for 30 minutes time for pizza one bang medium sauce pot add in the most virgin olive oil of all time this olive oil has no game medium heat till hot add in 4 cloves of garlic lightly crushed saute till fragrant about 30 seconds follow with chili flakes saute for 20 seconds then add a 28 ounce can around 800 grams of crushed tomatoes certainly let that simmer and reduce for about 15 minutes during occasionally now that olive oil might not have game but i do so i'm gonna make you a bouquet get three sprigs of fresh thyme and three sprigs of fresh oregano tie together tightly with kitchen twine now once your sauce is reduced cut off the heat plop in your bouquet and steep for 10 minutes season with additional salt as necessary now the rest is easy heavy bottom pot filled with vegetable oil no more than halfway and heat to 350 fahrenheit then roll a piece of dough into a six inch round carefully lay into your oil and let that fry for about two to four minutes flipping halfway in between and basting repeatedly to color and cook evenly and eventually you'll be greeted with a blistered crispy crust almost like it was sent from space strain generously on a paper towel pop onto a plate hit that with your sauce as little or as much as you like add some torn burrata some fresh torn basil leaves and if you want a little bit of prosciutto i'll be totally optional some fresh cracked pepper and you've got a pizza fritta but i also know that this looks like a hungarian dish i think it's called longos shout out to the hungarian homies but this is italiano now we're almost to the taste test but first we have to make pizza too which is a little bit more cheesy if you will just a little bit of a noria sauce medium saucepan olive oil sets the medium add in 3 ounces or 85 grams of guanchi allie cut into very small cubes so say for about three to five minutes or until crispy and smells like pork in your house then add in one fresno chili finely diced sauteed for 30 seconds add a 15 ounce or 425 gram can of crushed tomatoes half a cup or 120 milliliters of water stir it with a little bit of salt to taste and a bit of sugar added a one to two inch rind of pecorino set over medium heat and once it starts to simmer reduce the heat to low and let that cook for 15 to 20 minutes stirring occasionally or until thickened and delightful then remove the rind adjust salt levels as necessary and let that cool once it's cooled same concept one piece of dough down on a floured work surface and this time you're gonna roll to a seven inch by four and a half inch oval what are we making some sort of a calzone well sort of but not really on one side add a heaping tablespoon of your sauce with about a tablespoon of fresh mozzarella cut into small cubes then a teaspoon of grated low moisture mozzarella we got two different kinds of mozzarella okay finally a teaspoon of monterey jack now if you wanna be a real naughty one you're gonna finish that with two to three nice slices of mortadella now take your unfilled side fold that over the filled side crimp shut fully making sure no air has been trapped inside you can always poke a hole and squeeze out the air and then pitch it shut whatever just don't leave any holes anywhere now carefully lay that into fry oil laying away from you right because we're being careful here fry for two minutes flip and fry for an additional three minutes spacing occasionally or until cooked crispy and a light golden brown remove drain on paper towels and cue this sensuous music place in a plate hit it with a nice tall stack of fresh grated parmesan a nice haystack of very thinly basil now before i bust take a look at this cheese ball now there's nothing left to say but taste test these puppies and pick our winner some tells me it's gonna be the cheese boy big pizza actually it's a little one a little bit of smoked salt to finish okay how do you eat this you could eat it like this you could tear it only if you know about this um mommy where's this been all my life this might be the best pizza we've ever made if you don't have a pizza oven this is the route you go but we're not done son it's fine whoa it's like a giant totino's pizza roll but on god salty delicious chewy but it's got that crispy on the outside but above all it is the cheesiest bite of pizza i've ever put in my mouth i might just pick this over any other pizza but do you want to know what else i'd pick b-roll [Music] you

i'm a fan of it but can we make a gourmet version [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i try not to ask the question of should we make that but i did ask the question of can we and the answer is always yes so we're here today to make the one and only spam look this isn't just some canned meat grotesque as that sounds give me a little can late but what i want people to know is spam is near and dear not only to my heart but many chefs and many cultures around the world for a good reason it's actually pretty good i don't really have that much of a quarrel with it and i know it seems weird because i tend to have a very opinionated viewpoint on many things and my opinion and view on this is it's good what the hell you want me to freaking say so with all being said let's make this shall we we're at target we have spam to pick up there's not much to say about target it's a 4 out of 10 on everything there's no menu it's a grocery store let's go here it is i can't believe that they're putting it all the way in the corner no one puts baby in the corner we found the spam it was in the uh pickles and olives don't know why i haven't had coffee yet so i'm just gonna go we've got the whoa the can i like spin i've been pretty vocal about it not only that we've had spam as a partner but we had to do this there she is we're gonna go slice and sear this be right back we got a seared piece of am here's the thing this goes with almost anything in most cases it's a little too salty could it have more flavor potentially but i like spam can we defeat it we're gonna try wow some might think is this even possible listen everything and anything is possible it should never be a matter of can we or should we instead you should ask yourself will i now first we grind our meat you can hypothetically grind this at a food processor but it's gonna take you a really long time but papa has a new meat grinder so simmer show it off and see what this baby can do first you're gonna need an exact mix of the following three pounds or 1.3 kilograms of boneless pork boston butt and one and a half pounds or 680 grams of a nice smoked ham which i'd recommend getting one to two big thick slices from the deli so you can cut it more easily a third pound or 150 grams of prosciutto de parma sliced or unsliced doesn't matter and finally one pound or 450 grams of pork fat back now you're gonna cut these into pieces that are obviously gonna fit in your meat grinder but another great way to save time is instead to cut the big pieces of meat into just a few long strips so there's less tiny pieces you need to pump down there which means less movement per grind which equals faster grinding anyway grind all those four through your meat grinder and once it's all ground up take it out and run it through to grind one more time until it gets ultra fine need all of your ground meat aggressively i mean get your hand a hole up in there and once the meat is tacky and emulsified about one minute of kneading get a medium sized bowl and add 40 grams or three to four tablespoons of kosher salt one and a half tablespoons or 23 grams of granulated sugar 2 tablespoons are 12 grams of nutritional yeast that's been ground a little bit finer to sort of a powder consistency two and a half tablespoons or 28 grams of potato starch and one and a half tablespoons or 13 grams of cornstarch half a teaspoon and one gram of bay leaf powder yep literally bay leaves blended into a fine powder one teaspoon or four grams of proc powder number one full pause listen this stuff is powerful so please please please do not use more than what is listed here it's important just saying now whisk all that together then whisk in half a cup or 120 milliliters of ice cold water until fully combined pour that mixture into your ground meat and knead together until fully incorporated and looking lovely now divide your ground meat into two nine by five loaf pans try not to fill it more than about eighty percent of the way to the top as i know you're gonna need three loaf pans two for the meat one for the pressing okay press your meat firmly into that bad little pan make sure it's nice and tight in there it really does need to be edge to edge no air pockets flap on top and you can go one of two ways when it comes to cooking this either steam bath in the oven or sous-vide now i will say that sous-vide is going to give you the best results by far with much less clean up anyway for the sous vide method simply get yourself a soupy bag cut it to the right size in order to fit a whole loaf pan in it seal one of the sides of your bag so it's closed on one end gently slide in your pan push it all the way back to that sealed end pop it onto your vacuum sealer and seal it as tightly as you can making sure the bag gets full contact with the meat should look like this repeat with the other bread pan and then set into a large sous-vide water bath set to 175 fahrenheit in terms of the vessel for this you can use a 12-quart camber like this you could use a sink a cooler drop in your vacuum sealed bread pans and cook for two hours then remove from the sous-vide bath place another equally sized bread pan on top and weigh it down with something heavy like cans or just this big-ass water jug refrigerate it overnight to press and set and you're gonna do that with the other bread pans now if you wanna go to the steam bath method you'll also get a large baking dish or deep hotel pan like this pour in enough boiling water to create a one inch hot bath then add your meat filled bread pan or pans lightly cover the entire thing with foil and place into the oven that's been preheated to 300 degrees fahrenheit for 45 to 60 minutes then remove it and press it in the same way that you did with the sous vide one now once your spam has chilled overnight in the fridge carefully pop it out whittle a spatula around to help loosen it pop it out we gotta see the inside so give it a little slice and i gotta say that looks like a goddang spam if i ever seen one but does it sear properly well get yourself a medium sized pan set over medium high you can add a light coating of oil to the pan if you want and once screaming hot as many slices you want without overcrowding steer for two to three minutes flip and look at that beauty that looks right so you're for an additional one to two minutes and it's done i mean it really crisps up the same as a normal spam does but how does it compete this is a tough one i love spam so i don't know how i can choose between the two let's taste test and find out we got spam oh this came out so good this is a clear win i'm a fan of spam this to me has like the texture of like a hot dog very fine and sort of spongy this one's like the rib eye steak version of a hamburger this is a win but we can't say that without a taste tester someone who loves spam as well how are you doing my cub doing great papa bear all right pano it's time open up sweetheart all righty number two i'd say i prefer number one we won again yeah that one was just on another level i could taste like really taste the pork also the crispiness of it it crisped up a little bit better i like spam though and so i think this would go really well on like white rice and egg and stuff so we love spam and we got the dub but we're not stopping there so let's double down okay so how do you use this well anyway you'd use spam since this bam sort of feels like my son i wanted to make it a star just like bacon say in a blt i guess we could call this one an slt oh that acronym does not read well we'll call it a spam lt i made a real quick aleppo mail which consists of half a cup or 110 grams of mayonnaise three cloves of garlic grated one and a half teaspoons or two and a half grams of aleppo pepper salt and pepper to taste whisk that bad boy together and well that's it next you'll need a nice loaf of bread ideally a nice sourdough crusty loaf and i made this love myself not to flex or anything homemade bread homemade spam come on now anyway slice your bread up as thick or thin as you like toast that bad boy with butter in a pan on medium heat on both sides until roasty toasty beautiful but the inside's moisture than moisture slice a fatty heirloom tomato about a half an inch thick and always hit it with some salt to taste not getting into it right now sauce your bottom slice of bread generously with your mayo followed by your tomato some fresh butter lettuce and of course two to three slices of seared homemade spam now sauce the top piece of your toasted bread place that cell side down onto your spam to crown a beautiful king that might just knock the good old blt off the block let's find out this is um wow this is the perfect sandwich not only is the bread so light and crunchy and crispy and nice but you have this salty fatty pork that has the perfect ratio of meat to fat it's meaty it's anxious it's got umami this is like top three sandwiches we've ever made on the channel period there's beauty and simplicity but you want to know what else is beautiful and simple [Music] you

head and finding a true winner [Music] [Music] okay i know oh my god josh didn't open the cabinet relax looks a little different we built this place i designed it and more specifically i didn't buy enough handles so couldn't uh open the cabinet for you that's not what this is about this is about two noodles coming together to have a peaceful debate i think both of these dishes are special but it's one more special than the other well honestly i don't know how else are we going to find out so with all that being said let's make this shall we first off our korean stir fry chop ch first we start with our sauce five cloves of garlic finely minced into a bowl two and a half tablespoons or 23 grams of toasted sesame seeds two and a half tablespoons or 22 grams of toasted sesame oil two and a half tablespoons or 23 grams of light brown sugar four tablespoons or 54 grams of yanjo ganjang soy sauce uh how was that pronunciation not good okay all right sorry stir together until sugar's dissolved wow next get a large wok filled about halfway with water set to high heat once boiling at eight ounces or 226 grams of korean sweet potato starch noodles cool those for six to eight minutes or just until cooked through but still nice and chewy drain those bad boys out rinse with water to cool and sit to the side now heat your wok back up over medium high add about three tablespoons of vegetable oil and once hot and smoking add in one julienne carrot and half a yellow onion thinly sliced stir-fry for about three minutes or until just translucent and mostly cooked through but it light crunch then add in a quarter cup 113 grams of fresh shiitake mushrooms thinly sliced season lightly with salt to taste and continue to stir-fry for two more minutes or until the shiitake mushrooms are cooked through remove from the pan and set to the side in that same walk no need to clean it add six ounces or 170 grams of spinach heat over medium toss it occasionally until wilted add a little salt to taste and remove and set to the side yet again all right one more time oil up your big naughty wok heater over medium high until so hot you can hear it singing beautiful hymns to the sun add in 6 ounces or 170 grams of nicely marbled ribeye that's been thinly sliced seasoned a taste with salt sealed those bad boys just until browned about one minute flip and sear on the other side give it a few seconds of some stir-fry action for that good old wake add in your cooked carrots onions and mushrooms stir-fry a bit more then add in your sauce to taste cut the heat and stir to distribute now look this is optional but traditionally dropship will have something called jidan or jidan i know my pronunciation's not great but this job she is so my apologies now get yourself one egg separate the yolk from the white and get yourself a small non-stick skillet eat over medium with a light drizzle of vegetable oil add in your egg white and once the white is fully cooked about one to two minutes and has no browning on the bottom season lightly with salt carefully remove beat the egg yolk and repeat the exact same process with the yolk now once they're both cooked julienne those two and you're ready for assembly bowl some of your noodles followed by your beef mixture your spinach your jidan and a nice hearty drizzle of your garlicky sesame sauce it's almost like a bb bop version of noodles in a way sort of diet now moving on to yaki udon again we begin with small container a bowl two tablespoons of 24 grams of sure dashi two tablespoons or 29 grams of dark soy sauce one tablespoon or 12 grams of rice wine vinegar one tablespoon or 14 grams of mirin two tablespoons or 24 grams of oyster sauce two and a half tablespoons or 30 grams of palm sugar finely chopped mixed together and placed on the ceiling or to the side whatever you're vibing with walk hay time let's go heat your walk over medium high add just enough oil to cook the whole pan about three tablespoons increase the heat to high you know high for hay once that's ripping add half a pound or 255 grams of ground pork let that sit here for two to three minutes or till nicely colored on one side season lightly with salt to taste then just stir-fry until cooked through and you get some nice crispy bits about one to three minutes remove from the pan reapply oil to your pan and move quickly here once it's hot again add one cup or 86 grams of sliced trumpet mushrooms season lightly with salt the taste sear tossing occasionally for three minutes or to lightly brown and cook through and add in half a yellow onion that's been cut into one inch pieces again seasoned taste with salt we always season when we add new ingredients unless they are already heavily salted once it's done add three green onions that have been cut into one inch pieces stir-fry for two minutes keeping that heat ripping lastly add in one cup or 90 grams of rough chopped green cabbage stir fry and once everything is welded about two to three minutes add your pork back in along with one pound or 450 grams of uno noodles cooked to the package directions and just a touch good lower anyway a touch of ground white pepper and a nice handful of bonito flakes and finally all of your sauce stir fry everything together about one minute or until the sauce thickens and gets your noodles nice and glossy cut the heat and as tradition around here my personal technique of choice finish with three to six garlic cloves finely chopped stir together and your noodles are done pop that into a beautiful bowl topped with additional green onion if desired and we have two absolutely stunning bowls of noodles visually it's hard to say the right looks like a well-kept backyard but the left one says hey you've had a long night sweetheart so let's see which one's gonna lullaby me into a flavor driven dance two incredible stir fried meals so we got japchae and we have yaki udon all of this gets stir-fried together this one is like partitioned there's multiple layers of stir-frying since this one is calling my name with its luxurious sounds this is exactly what i have in mind when i think of korean cuisine the intense toasted sesame a little bit of sweetness garlicky i want that garlic to be give me a next up yaki udon this is what's gonna make it or break it ah that's good one of these nudes go in your mouth and you're immediately gonna say i don't know if i have a specific situation in which you would eat either one of these they work for any time any day i think i'm gonna call this one a thai does there have to be a winner i'm stumped does anyone want to come in and taste and see if they have a differing opinion on that mono's here yeah for me it's a easy winner it's their done that is really good i would take that one 10 times out of 10 unless it was like super hot outside i would agree with that i would agree with that but what other way to tell than making it your goddang sale but you want to know what else you should make yourself b-roll [Music] my you

cheese we're gonna put it together and make an incredible meal including a drink with all that being said let's make this shall we simple juicy crunchy whole dark meat chicken nuggets creamy mac and

a large bowl add one cup of 240 milliliters of whole milk one tablespoon or 10 grams of salt optionally one and a half teaspoons or eight grams of msg two teaspoons or eight grams of garlic powder half a teaspoon or half a gram of onion powder one teaspoon or three grams of paprika whisk all that but wait if you happen to have dill pickles in your refrigerator then also add half a cup or 120 milliliters of dill pickle juice totally optional but gem once combined add all your chicken to your milkies and refrigerate covered for at least 10 minutes but ideally overnight now for the flour dredge large bowl one and a half cups are 225 grams of all-purpose flour two teaspoons or seven grams of salt half a teaspoon or half a gram of finely ground black pepper one teaspoon or one gram of celery powder optional unless you happen to have it it gives kind of a mirepoix flavor which i like but not necessary half a teaspoon or half a gram of onion powder two tablespoons or 15 grams of powdered sugar one teaspoon or four grams of [Music] optional but yeah one teaspoon or four grams of garlic powder give that some whiskey business until thoroughly combined and you have your dredge let's pause and make our drink inside if we're gonna make a lemonade even if it's butt cheaper we're gonna make the most lemoniest lemonade i can fathom first small bowl half a cup for 112 grams of sugar followed by the zest of three whole lemons once that's in rub that all together with your fingertips to expel as much of the lemon oil from the sugar now pop that into a small saucepan add one and a quarter cup or 300 milliliters of water heat over medium stirring occasionally until all the sugar is dissolved and your mixture is hot and steamy cut off the heat and add two black tea bags steep five minutes and strain all that through fine mesh trainer into a container filled with another one and a quarter cup or 300 milliliters of additional plain filtered water finally add the juice of your three zested lemons stir and you have an arnold palmer ready to be poured over ice now mac and cheese doesn't need to be from a box yeah it might take an extra 10 to 15 minutes to make but it's at least two to four times better than the box stuff cook one pound of 500 grams of macaroni and salted boiling water according to package directions or until train then in a medium pot add one tablespoon or 14 grams of unsalted butter heat over medium once melted and bubbling stirring 1 tablespoon or 10 grams of all-purpose flour let that cook stirring often for 30 seconds whisk in one cup

then back into the marinade and finally back into the flour making sure to coat every little crevice of each chicken piece place on a baking sheet to the side and bread the rest of your chicken in batches you'll carefully add your chicken to the preheated oil and cook for three to five minutes or until beautifully golden brown crispy and cooked to an internal temperature of 165 fahrenheit remove place on a wire rack to drain lightly season with salt while they're piping hot and they're done there's not a whole plating sequence here it's very simple glass filled with ice pour up your arnold palmer add a lemon slice if you want to feel a little pinky up you know fill a nice shallow bowl with your chicken spoon your mac and cheese into another bowl feel free to add a sauce of choice literally just mayo and a few grated garlic cloves works beautifully and you have a family-style chicken nugget meal and this comes at a price competitive with fast food joints but a flavor that's first class of its own or at least i hope so let's find out chicken nugget meal you know it's not something that we think is expensive but boy oh boy okay so chicken little dunk this is a perfect example of technique bringing you home oh and you wash it all down with this little lemonade got it the standard chicken nugget meal has devolved it's just like french fries and chicken nuggets

ingredients like actually in there in there it's a slightly higher fat pork so you said that it doesn't matter how much fat is in it it just matters how much it weighs yeah the higher the fat sometimes the easier but i always get more full faster whenever i eat something fatty i'm full i'm farting it's like it's a nightmare the contest isn't if you can hold enough harder the content is if you can eat it fast and this this guy whatever happens afterwards you don't worry about it salt that's gonna go in it seems like a lot we gotta remember we've got it's little pounds of meat here the soy sauce the same thing we're gonna kind of do it to taste like what kind of soy sauce you usually use matt god i'm gonna have some so many complexes i don't have a favorite soy sauce no i don't have a sharp knife like you i'm gonna feel so empty it doesn't matter how empty you feel because you won't be you're going to be full of the biggest dumpy meat is done you did a great job all you how much experience you have with the sous vide i don't even know what that word i i know what i mean is this your first sous vide eating challenge guess so seal this one under this back bag why does it suck on it when it seals it i didn't ask for the suck we got a nice little seal now this is our receptacle for me you see how there's all these air pockets we're going to treat this sort of like an olympic sport i want you to use gravity suction into there let's cup oh my goodness good lord look at that that's a big round of applause right there for maximum thank you that i've never seen more beautiful meat than yours what oh my okay come on now don't give up on me now do you do that even when the cameras aren't going you know i i do yeah i usually i'm smacking my meat when the camera so i thought yeah let's go oh flat looking thing right what we're going to do to keep this cylindrical we're going to kind of make this into a sausage essentially kitchen twine are you going to tying like a shoe yeah this thing wants to burst it the seams wind going literally all right that's a good knot my son our son our son i don't don't put it that way i gotta use it in like 30 minutes oh uh our nephew it's edge to edge all the water in here is going to be exactly 130 frames well it doesn't float so this is gonna stay in there for two hours so we're just gonna stand here for two hours [Music] wow that wasn't that bad i felt like it was pretty easy yeah we've got a log of meat it's really not all that different from a meatloaf except it's perfectly cooked we have a finished dough sweet a little flour down matt since you were the one that gave birth to this i think that you should be the one to uh to put it out of its misery what shape are we going for like we want round and we want it to be pretty thin so just start like rolling this way and a little this way try to like coerce it don't let it tell you what to do absolutely not you're the master of this dough's entire life it gets to be eaten by the one and only medicine that's that's how it goes that's pretty violent way to go you had to choose your the one way to die what would it be happy it's like a large pizza this looks great i'm blown away you did really good you were supposed to not be able to do this pull this guy out oh it's hot you ever seen one of these victims that bounce you know what's a good sign when your meat bounces you know i mean it smells like a dumpling oh yeah a bit more meat than we need i'm just trimming this down ever so slightly we're still gonna get away in i'm just gonna flatten this so it doesn't roll here we go what if i did it at the top yeah yes a little bit of water help it here everybody's holding their breath this is gonna work guys combine the two here hear that nicely it's looking kind of dumpling yes i think i'm gonna give it some pleating actually i've never pleated dumpling this large [Music] should the pleats look good whenever things get big it's actually harder to work with you think they'd be harder if they're smaller big gyoza clothes worried for a second that turned out really good so not to flex but this new oven does have a steam function steam your dumpling however you can this is not going to fit in a steamer basket this is not going to fit in your pot this is not a butt cheaper we don't have parchment we're using cabbage because cabbage repels dough it's like a bed this is sturdy you do not want a loose dumpy grow up so fast they they go off into the steam oven so fast yeah they always come back they do come back so i have no idea how long this is gonna take because i've never made a giant dumpling i'm gonna say eight minutes the time has come that is a very long it didn't fall apart it didn't fall apart it looks exactly like a dumpling just a giant dumpling brush it with a little sesame oil you bring them back to life keep it nice you know i've never seen a giant dumpling this beautiful before and it's staining upright too let's weigh this what does that say wow exactly five this is exciting i have no idea what i'm gonna do i haven't even thought this far we have one of the greatest if not the greatest competitive eater in the world here today eating the largest dumpling you've ever seen but that doesn't stop a man like this three two one go all right he's going in oh he's going wow goodness gracious i've never seen this before in my entire life he's starting with the corner piece i'm blown away it's already a quarter way down he's using water he's working his way through it oh my goodness this is eating at its finest look at it and it's still staying together oh my god 42 seconds corners down he's chewing away it's still standing up this feels like a flex for me just as much as a flex for him my sides are hurting big dumpy the largest bites a human being can do we're sitting at one third of a dumpling done he's almost at a half i've never seen a human being do this before he's shaking it up we're at the three-quarter way point i'm like nervous for your fingers man i think this is gonna be an under six minute dumpy he's eating this entire dumpling faster than it took to cook the dumpling you got this matt we're at the last 10 last eight percent finish it with the sauce strong one fight five minutes and 55 seconds matt stoney the god he is here single-handedly one of the most scary things i've ever experienced in my life delicious i don't know any other human being in the world that could ever eat a gyoza of that stature that quickly matt thank you for being here and more specifically thank

Cooking Challenge Against A Master Sushi...",2022-12-02 21:59:44.385768, people go to sushi restaurants for a lot of reasons it takes too long to make it home right we'll see about that [Music] listen sushi's meant to be eaten fresh you put it together and you eat it within like 30 seconds of it being made the rice is still a little warm and the fish is still cold that is proper sushi typically but it's 8 pm on a week night oh go on my little extra delivery fee app order it after 35 minutes of sitting in a box that's real fresh isn't it it's not typically the restaurants have their stuff prepped the rice the sushi zoo the toppings i'm doing everything everything ulysses and potter are going to go out and get it and i have to make it before they get back so let's begin again for you tuna rolls for 10 minutes thank you come on recipe on the website we gotta wash our rice i'd love to skip it but if you're gonna make sushi and you're not washing your rice you're awful i'm sorry okay so while that's filling up for however godly amount of time there's not a lot of cooked stuff except for the rice and this but we gotta get it done you can't make sushi rice without sushi zoo you need it sugar salt goes in very nice you want it salty okay you're not using all this rice vinegar it's a little runny this is mirin notice that you have a fresh fade how does that do for aerodynamics definitely helps with my speed speaking of speed i have a beef to pick with the comment section y'all seen that car just pass me by yeah cause i'm driving safe y'all trying to get me fired in the comment section saying i'm driving too slow i'm doing my job all right we had to switch pots because we had a little waking okay so while this is heating let that go wash rinse drain and then repeat kombu the element of the sea kombu's vegetarian and vegan wow look at that this recipe is not though sorry i'll get my pressure cooker prepped we've got two cups of water to go with the two cups of rice it's equal parts we know that the pressure cooker is the savior of our days we've got a sauce i'm gonna prep right here okay no boiling cut it off so you see that all the sugar salts dissolve don't let that sit for a second moving on to this sauce put in my miso koopa sriracha and lemon juice whisk it up already very behind we can at least make this tuna one that's the sauce this is not going with the tuna this is its own standalone sauce and i got a bone to pick with some of you guys airbender double o 69 i read your comment bro yeah they gotta read the comments we're already you can't understand what i'm saying it's cause i have braces bro i have braces and it hurts to talk but another stir you know you can see the rice gearings are sort of turning a translucent that's what you want starting to absorb some of that water container that's a little bit reverse and all you would do rice then water so it spreads out but do we have time no i've never done sushi rice in a pressure cooker it feels wrong but you do what you got to do all right manual and then we're doing it for oh god it's set to 90 minutes i'm weeded right now but you know what one of the things about being weeded is you can always get yourself out of the weeds it just depends on whether or not you believe do you believe oh oh i put it to 237 good okay three minutes and then the rest is natural release moving on to tuna hey wait a minute you're telling me you don't need to cook raw fish for a raw fish based ingredient boom cutting board kendrick always gets a little nervous on but faster because i sometimes have to walk past him with a knife i don't know what that face is kendrick kendrick doesn't have fear only his love cheers for people who are afraid to die i have fishy amy from south dakota why does ulysses always have to go get the food because everyone else has a job vikram can't get off the camera obviously pano's recording kendrick's on the other camera who's gonna pick up the food amy from south dakota we need to cube this bad boy up so i'm gonna actually cut this in half whenever you're cutting fish you'll notice that a lot of time i do these long strokes but we're not gonna give this back shots instead what we're gonna do is we're gonna do one long drag heel the tip and the reason that we do that is to avoid shredding the flesh up too much because if you saw at it and it's going to start falling apart you're not going to get nice cubes one long drag drag drag so you can see how clean these cubes are carefully not too not to tear the flesh we want these whole nice hearty ch i just want to give a shout out to kevin who's been like the moan king on tick tock so if you're wondering who's responsible for that there he is look at that god i want to kiss that face you're right maybe i'm overreacting because it's not the whole comment section there's a whole other side of the comment section i like to call them the ulysses nation they feel me they support me they're like you know what bro you drive slower you drive safer right you beat josh we're gonna root for you shout out ulysses nation in the comments section tuna is done that goes there sesame oil sriracha you can also use really any chili sauce you want if you like another chili sauce use a different chili sauce oh sriracha is overrated yes it is overrated it is so what i like it's tasty get over yourself koopa mail in so we're using more sriracha than koopie carefully notice this motion okay folding it together i'm not like all right we're not making shredded tuna here we want this to be nice and whole and beautiful might as well call this goddamn tuna bowl we just have a few more vegetables to prep thai chilies tops removed little sweet little heat you know those are done eight minutes away from the restaurant wow undeniably slow yeah you listen but all the cars pass you up because i'm not in the left lane left lanes for going fast obviously i'm not going fast bro they are really slow they're like slow to the point where it's like grandpa hey grandpa come on green onion remove fry parts of the stem you don't always see me do that it's really important because the dry part system are yucky then you end up with nice clean slices no broken bruised bits the people who are handing the produce they just want to get it in there and i respect that but that means that the tips of these are getting slapped around and you don't want your tips slapped around trust me all right i've been there i've got the fillings almost done but like the rice i'm waiting on avocado you cut it in half turn it order it while it's still whole please be careful with your hand please okay boom and then we have quarters already ready the seed comes out really easily you don't have to do the whole whack and then it goes through the avocado through your hand and then you're like oh wow i'm in the er awesome peel slice in it out there what's your favorite color hannah why are you always talking when i'm driving bro you'll be the main reason we be losing always talking bro about nothing what you should be doing helping me with directions fried onion am i frying it myself i already know what i'm gonna see here uh oh josh is using pre-fried vegetables look this stuff is actually pretty decent you never had this i actually like it i'm making enough stuff from scratch natural release we're gonna wait on that i mean we have pretty much everything i would say ready we have to wait on the rice now why is this rice taking so long oh boy bro we got me out here hella far i'm just gonna let the rice rip we gotta go i've got my hongiri which i have soaked in water you gotta at least have let me have that there it is i've got my sushi suit which i don't really have time to properly cut we're cutting the rice we gotta season it up with this bad boy cut it fold it together being careful not to break up any rice cut it hold together normally i would put it in the rice cooker to keep it warm but it's way too hot right now so we got to figure out how to cool this down i will not under season my rice i'm breaking so many rules right now we got to cool this down ice water rice that's so wrong we're going to spatula cool this rice use the ulysses nation and tell us what you want to see on what faster do it okay okay it's almost there where are we at rice is starting to stiffen up a little bit you see that see right right starting to hold together this is the beauty of an ice bath this will save your life in so many scenarios full of water sushi mat i don't fully remember how to do this so let's figure it out together grab a handful of that that goes on it's a little loose on spread it nicely this rice is so hot i'm having flashbacks when i was cooking with damon i'm like jesus christ i don't feel like i have learned anything sesame seeds so this is going to get flipped over onto this if that scared you all it scared me too tuna goes in i need to be perfect at this point it's good enough avocado slices a little bit of this guy a little bit of thai chili and then we're going to quickly and carefully roll roll roll press and roll press and roll it's not perfect not perfect by any means it's rolled all right it's so sticky six we get six rolls out of it it wasn't my best rolling top secret tip here chef's way of hiding big mistakes turn away all of the inconsistent pieces which are most of them and then on top of these dot dot dot dotting it up and then one big one right there just like that you see the sushi restaurant they're hiding all the  that's what they're doing we're gonna need a fried onion right across the top and then of course on our sauce there we go i lost a year off my life but it's time never matter if we got it i did my job got in the car went and got the food that's what's about to be delivered everything after that unnecessary they don't know that we've beaten them so i'm just gonna hide this and i'm gonna pretend like i'm still making one look i'm just doing my job right food is here watch all this other unnecessary [Music] i'm going i'm going oh man you guys got me just kidding remember what i said so extra bro i'm just doing my job i don't know they're a bit big i will say comparatively we have these these don't look bad i would argue this is way too thin there's like barely any rice on here i'm gonna try theirs first they don't have a sauce with it okay no sauce i'm just gonna basic spicy tuna nothing to it if i got it i'd be like this is all right moving on to mine i'm not gonna sauce it because that wouldn't be fair mine are way too big too much rice too big i was in a rush it kind of tastes like if you took a spicy tuna roll and mixed it with an everything bagel don't know how that happened but it's good now let's taste test number two why'd you start with two again i don't remember here's number one yeah number two by the way number one number two number one number two one we won butt faster uh b-roll oh we don't have b-roll you

second to talk about mine [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so we love what we're seeing with papatapa thank you so much we appreciate it we're about to sell out on many of our items so don't forget to get your own before it runs out because it's not coming back the link is in the description love you okay so today we are making the chick-fil-a waffle fry wow we're talking about the fries in a chicken fast food joint how does that make sense this has become significantly more prominent over the years waffle shaped crisscross holy potato fry when i say holy i mean holes in it before that gets misconstrued so with all that being said let's make this shall we we're at chick-fil-a i just got back from vikram's wedding [Music] if you are wondering why i look raggedy that's why all right we're at the three-point system this place is pretty raggedy because they're performing construction but i get it so i'm gonna give them a seven out of ten it's always been very organized make that an eight out of ten the menu we know it's on the chick-fil-a menu i like that they keep it simple but i don't like their vibe service is all i don't i don't even need to meet the people to give the service a 10 out of 10. the service is always insane i don't know how they do it can i just get two orders of fries thank you so much appreciate it well we might as well do the taste test in here you thought not in the car you nasty so we got the bag chick-fil-a sauce we're familiar with that kate loves these fries and uh we're gonna analyze it right now i've always wondered how the hell do you get this shape in the first place right off the bat zero salt the fry on it isn't as good as i thought it would be the beauty of a waffle fries it should be crispy it should be undeniably glass-like and full of flavor and it has all those ridges to catch salt and yet you didn't put any on it and with the clout that these have come on and i'm sure people are thinking can you even make the shape we're gonna do a whole lot more than that ah yet another iconic item that seems impossible to make right wrong it's beautifully simple but josh we need to know how to get that gap dang shape sure you could just sit there and whittle your way into oblivion one slice at a time with a knife and i'm sure whatever waffle fry producer has a monstrosity of a machine that can make them a quintillion at a time or you can get a mandolin with a crinkle cut attachment here's the trick get yourself a rusted potato for this recipe only about four large ones which will easily produce enough fries for four to six people and make sure you wash them because we're not gonna be peeling them set your crinkle cup mandolin to about a half inch thickness setting start by slicing your potato one way like you would normally and once you've created some nice grooves on the potato quarter turn so the grooves now run against the grooves on the mandolin slice once quarter turn slice again quarter turn slice again see where i'm going here that's what's going to get you that wacky holy looking waffle fry thing that tantalizes us delights us i mean look at these now repeat this process with all your titers get yourself a large pot fill it with about four quarts of water one tablespoon of 14 grams of vinegar 1 tablespoon or 10 grams of baking soda 1 tablespoon or 15 grams of kosher salt bring to a boil add in your tigers and cook for about 30 seconds or just until soft do not overcook these remove and dry off any water with a paper towel cool completely place them on multiple baking sheets whichever fits you know i don't know figure it out right special analytical skills are good and place those in the freezer overnight you gotta wait for it now you listen to me pal you better not skip this gatlings dip and then whine to me in the comments how it didn't work oh but josh i only change this entire method arguably you could just freeze them and leave them in your freezer until you want waffle fries for the homies now let's talk sauce obviously ketchup or mayo if you're real but obviously we have our own chick-fil-a sauce this one's a little different than the last one get yourself a bowl and add one and a quarter cup or 140 grams of mayo a third cup or 83 grams of dijon mustard two tablespoons or 29 grams of yellow mustard one tablespoon or 12 grams of ketchup a quarter teaspoon which is less than a gram of cayenne pepper one teaspoon or three grams of smoked paprika one clove of garlic grated a third cup or 90 grams of honey salt pepper to taste 2 teaspoons of 28 grams of lemon juice whisk all that together until thoroughly combined and well that's actually that's it american sauces are real different than them got dang french ones or just about literally anywhere else and you know what kind of tastes good now notice depending on the mayo you add this also benefits from a couple tablespoons of smoky barbecue sauce which will help give it a little bit more of a classic taste if you like and obviously there's [Music] labor all right hard part's over now buckle up them pants make them tired for papa and let's finish this grab yourself a seven to eight quart heavy bottom pot filled about halfway with vegetable oil and heat to 350 fahrenheit drop in your potatoes directly from the freezer i repeat while they are frozen yes you're frying the fries from frozen out of the freezer while they are frozen from the freezer they were freezing in and are still frozen chili boy fry those bad boys for one to three minutes or until your fries are beautifully crisp stiff and lightly golden brown remove from the oil drain on a wire rack and immediately season a taste with salt don't wait seriously season them while they're hotter than the earth's atmosphere in today's climate unfortunately so that the salt sticks repeat with all your frozen boys and guess what that is just a stunning jewel of a waffle fry if i've ever seen one so now we're going to find our winner here we go a little dip wow the sauce is great but sauce aside the crunch on the outside is great it's nice and fragile it's not too crunchy it's not too soft and the inside fluffy like a fine whipped potato puree that's a dub to me but we're gonna bring vickerman today for the taste test hi vikram hello here is number one number two papaya bao that is it second one definitely the winner when i saw how thin they were i didn't think they'd be fluffy they were very fluffy crispy salty all around yeah yeah wait a minute so any type of fry is going to behave differently when you cook it this on the other hand i would argue is one of the easiest to get right so if you're going to take the time to make something make this do you want to know what else you should make b-roll

don't you forget we got Papa tapa boom still available limited time only go get it Link in the description so today we are doing ba versus Ramen if someone were to ask me this question which they have many times I usually feel like well it depends on the mood depends on the vibe right but I've never really sat down and had them side by side so we're gonna make two incredible versions put them head to head to find out who the real winner is so let's make this shall we okay in the far side of the Ring we have Pho wow look at the form the fragrance emanating from deep within and in the other corner of the Ring we have a miso tonkotsu Ramen thick and rich just how I like them Josh oh hey me too Josh by the way you look great today hey thanks right let's begin with Pho before we start whining this is actually a very easy process it just takes a while so let's make it simple first you brown and try your bones this eliminates the need to parboil animations the broth flavor preheat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit sheet trait lime with foil cut with vegetable oil lay out five pounds or 2.2 kilograms of beef bones a good mix of knuckle and Marrow with a fair bit of meat left in the bone is ideal spray your drizzle this with a little bit more oil to coat evenly placing your oven for 20 to 30 minutes or until deeply browned on a separate baking sheet ideally a quarter sheet lined with foil add two large onions cut in half with their skin left on leaving their cut side facing up one large dump of Ginger sliced in half width wise to expose the inside nicely cut side facing up cut this with oil pop into the broiler until deeply charred on the outside as for your spices I like to use what's called a this is basically going to be your little sack of fragrance for your broth get a 5x5 inch square of cheesecloth you may need multiple layers of it add in 5 star anise three black cardamom pods five cloves a third cup or 22 grams of toasted coriander seeds one cinnamon stick gather up all the ends forming a sack tie off the top and make sure to close your sack tightly please keep the mind out of the gutter separately you'll need a one pound or 450 gram chuck roast boneless so get a 10 inch pan set of a medium-high heat add just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom and cereal beef on both sides for two to three minutes per side to get a beautiful brownie that will surely bring all the homies to the yard and ideally you'll do this in the same pot that you're cooking in but ours was preoccupied at the time speaking of the pot you'll need one that's at least eight to ten quarts fill that up with your brown beefy boys all of your nice charred vegetables yes the charred skins and all don't be afraid of flavor all right sweaty then add in just enough cold filter water to cover around five quarts or five liters one and a half tablespoons of light brown sugar and your seared chuck roast obviously if you've done that in the same pot then it would already be in there but yeah oh and don't you worry I saved the fawn from the pan that right sear the beefing anyway he did the medium high and as soon as it starts to come to a boil reduce heat to low and simmer that bad boy for about four hours the first 30 minutes be sure to skim any scum that rises to the top and once that's cooked down Taste and reduce further if it's not quite as Rich tasting as it should be then carefully fish out the majority of the solids but reserve the chuck roast in a single of a piece as you can then strain it into a slightly smaller pot to keep everything hot add in a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of fish sauce stir and adjust the fish sauce levels as desired so that's it we're almost ready to serve by now now all that's left is cook eight ounces or 227 grams of rice noodles in boiling water according to the package directions you know like a Al Dente Australian rinse with cold water until completely cold I want them things shiver in their Timbers add a nice amount of your noodles into a large bowl separately you'll slice one pound or 450 grams of flank stick as thinly as you can you might have heard it freezing the meat helps with getting it thin but you know what else helps get it thin a sharp knife yeah wouldn't have to do all that waiting if you're done for just sharp oh haha Josh so silly I don't have a sharp knife why not you hurt me every day anyway add a nice handful of your sliced raw beef to the bowl and stay calm here some very thinly sliced sweet onion then little in your boiling hot broth over the veg and meat and look at that if your broth is properly heated then it'll cook the beef beautifully while contributing some of its own flavor to said broth that's among means Sprouts which I hate but I'm putting them in there anyway for those who like them all right Papa still loves you top of the first cilantro albeit sacrilegious maybe some Thai Basil because I like it some sliced chili if you want it spicy and simply serve with lime wedges fish sauce and Hoisin on the side that's far now let's talk about an easier tonkotsu there's no way around it Ramen has a lot more elements to it so we'll run through them quickly first Joshua get a three pound or 1.3 kilogram piece of pork belly roll it up nice and deut tied up with some kitchen twine at three intervals to maintain its shape get a seven to eight quart heavy bottom pot add enough oil to coat the bottom feed to medium high until so hot I'll slap my knee till the goddamn dog comes through the wrong door again add your pork and sear for one to two minutes per side to get some light Browning for that take the bad boy out add in a mix of the following a two inch piece of fresh ginger peeled and rough chopped five green onion kind of new one in segments one shallot peeled and halved yes you can leave the skin on are good fall that with one cup or 240 milliliters of sake one cup or 240 milliliters of mirin three quarters of a cup or 180 milliliters of good quality shoyu one cup or 240 milliliters of water and a quarter cup or 56 grams of granulated sugar oh and you know you can't forget some of the stuff that's Spilled Out on your mesoplast tray am I right it's got that flavor heat to medium high took them to a boil reduced to low add in your chashu and simmer covered turning occasionally for two and a half hours or until you have a beautiful hunk of belly now you can totally slice this now and use it immediately but I personally like to chill it completely to get cleaner cuts and sear the individual pieces more efficiently up to you pal Live Your Life Next tari medium sauce pot a quarter cup of 16 milliliters of sake set to medium high oil until half reduced reduce the heat to medium then add half a cup or 118 milliliters of mirin half a cup or 120 milliliters of aged soy sauce a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of shiradashi and once that reaches a steamy heat but no boiling add in one cup of 13 grams of Bonito flakes cut off the heat and let that steep for 10 minutes and strain that through a mesh strainer and you have Atari that smells like a fresh campfire in the middle of a soy sauce aging chamber that sound good pal all right when it comes to homie and ramen a lot of people skip the aroma oil and I've learned that it's really non-negotiable I mean look if you're gonna spend the time to make this don't stop at the aroma oil please you might as well just stop in totality I don't know go toot somewhere saucepan down medium heat add a half cup or 103 grams of lard oh I want to use vegetable oil stop this is important to contribute to that pork flavor of the broth as opposed to what vegetable oil brings to the table flavor wise I'll give you a hint it's nothing once that's hot and melted add in one bunch of green onions got a new one inch segments and eight garlic cloves peeled and left whole let that cook stirring often at medium heat so the vegetables are toasted nicely and it smells absolutely magnificent buff strain all the veg out and stir in one teaspoon or five grams of toasted sesame oil mix until combined and that's nice as for the ramen eggs look I'm fine with marinated eggs but to be honest kind of prefer regular soft-boiled eggs but you can totally marinate these if you wish but I get so many questions Josh how do you make yourself buildings making yourself a leg is not some ethereal Talent it's literally boiling water eggs put in there for six minutes ice bath until warm peel into running water or water bath and voila guess what that's it the main concern is the egg can sense your fear remember that okay that leads us to broth I've got good news you do not need to overnight boil this specific broth I got a little bit of a hack for you so pot down add in two pounds or 900 grams of pork neck bones two and a half pounds or 1.1 kilos of sliced pork pox with an H add in just enough cold filtered water to cover set to medium high and once it comes to a boil strain into a colander rinse off your bones then add all those rinse bones to a pressure cooker or instant pot this reason alone is worth investing in one adding just enough cold filtered water to cover making sure not to pass up that fill line cover and set to high pressure for one and a half hours release the pressure then add in half a pound or 227 grams of solid pork fat back that's not lard that's pork fatback unrendered if you put rendered pork fat it'll just melt in there it's not gonna do what you want cover again and set the high pressure for another one and a half hours then release the pressure oh my God Josh is not quitting stay calm we have enough gelatin in this thing to emulsify a God dang swimming pool carefully fish out that pork fat back place it in a blender with about a pint of the hot broth please make sure there's no bones in it unless you want to say goodbye to your blender and blend on ice speed for about 30 to 45 seconds or until the mixture is beautifully creamy and emulsified now strain your broth that hasn't been emulsified in no medium-sized stockpot then add in your emulsified broth to that set it under a stove over medium high add in one bunch of green onion cut into one inch segments five cloves of garlic peeled left hole and one inch knob of Ginger slice drink to a boil then reduce the heat to low and reduce for 25 minutes once that's done straighten out the veg and finally whisk in half a cup or 75 grams of red miso quarter cup or 41 grams of white miso bing bang miso tonkotsu Ramen broth put your nose against the screen is that nice what are some notes you're picking up off that let us know in the comments all right we're finally here let's assemble this bad boy cut the stems off one pound of peach mushrooms hit a 12 inch Skillet with enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan add in your mushrooms season and taste with salt and saute for 5 minutes or until soft and lightly brown cut your off in half slice up some green onion and Bowl up in this order about two and a half tablespoons of your tari in the bottom one to two strong Ladle fulls of your Ramen broth treat ramen noodles that have been cooked and cooled according to package directions a nice heap of your mushrooms want to do beautiful slices of your pork belly that have been torched or thrilled until lightly charred and hot some fresh thinly sliced green onion a soft-boiled egg half your aromatic oil drizzled lovingly atop and finally some noise strips if you Vibe like that now we have two kings of Kings PHA and ramen I'd be lying if I said I could barely speak because my mouth is wetter than the water and hold down south other that or I'm nervous which way this is gonna go because look these are my two favorites so let's taste test and find out who our winner will be ah here we are two of my favorite soups dare I say just dishes in general first off all right mix that up oh oh I mean it's good salty sweet sour you got the Chewy from the nudes it's such like a healing broth it just feels good to eat now moving on to Ramen I mean this stuff is creamy this is tough I'm gonna categorize these well is the ideal choice for daily eating right it's not that heavy you can kind of eat it whenever you want it feels good you can walk away with energy this this is like a full-on experience there's so much flavor and it's like punching you in the face so this is my personal favorite but I think that they're both winners depending on what your eating style is you want to eat this stuff regularly more often you're going to want to pick this but if you want a full-on experience like once a week or whenever whenever Ramen will always fulfill you there's a soup for every person but do you want to know what else is for every person

Papatapa: http://www.pa...",2022-12-02 21:59:44.385768, how have we not done this we smacked him on the bottom before so now i think it's time to put them to bed [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] much of our papa toppa drop is selling out quickly don't forget to get yours link is in the description once this is gone this drop is gone limited time apparel inspired by food thank you by the way also so today we are making the kfc eight piece bucket meal what entails a bucket meal i guess it's the whole point of like the meat and three kind of you get the fried chicken and the three different sides or fried chicken biscuit in one or two sides something in that realm this isn't just about making the bucket meal better it's about making every element in it better the mashed potatoes which is easy the gravy the chicken etc right but it's also the collective experience of it all working together in unison to create one synonymous experience so with all that being said let's make this shall we wow there it is we are for one thing and one thing only eight piece the three-point test we i forgot what did we rate this last time visually two out of ten because i don't like the combo collab i like things kept separate like that i don't know how to describe it menu one out of ten oh it's got a jack harlow meal i forgot about that i'll give it a three out of ten cause jack harlow can i just get the eight piece meal we get look at this gunk this building well two things that guy made this experience significantly better although he doesn't work here i'm gonna give service 10 out of 10. that dude was very nice the building is getting lowered to a negative one out of ten that is horrible if it looks like that on the outside what does it look like on the inside gotta upkeep it you know i feel like we've had a whole adventure almost had good food let's end this we got the bag what's that say it really depends on how you read this i'm full of chicken and side dishes jesus christ bon appetit this looks like a chick-fil-a nugget i asked for a side of mashed potatoes they gave me two coleslaw we ordered two of these because we need one for the thumbnail coleslaw coleslaw are you serious do you guys legitimately think that we want two and a half quarts of coleslaw go blow up a tea here's the chicken it's soggy what's the point of this this didn't do anything just put the is this 1832 a spork i guess i'll eat all my coleslaw with it i'm so disappointed right now holy sh yep extra crispy i don't want to eat this look at how dry this is jollibee is destroying kfc please go to jollibee please holy sh and it's under season oh jesus this is bad out of all the meals we've had about better this is by far the worst i'm sorry i can't i can't eat that someone come smell this i almost actually that's actually kfc literally left no room for anything good they closed the door all right we got our mashed potatoes holy that's the sock at the bottom of my hamper i've never had into the mashed potatoes before i'm actually kind of nervous oh where's my coffee here's the gravy i can get with that that's not bad there's no helping there that made their case worse back to it a fried chicken meal isn't just a meal it's a multi-level experience consisting of fine biscuits mashed potatoes a luxurious gravy a refreshing slaw and of course the star buttermilk fried [Music] let's start with the biscuits in a food processor add two and a half cups with 375 grams of all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons or 12 grams of fine sea salt 1 teaspoon or 5 grams of granulated sugar pulse a few times to incorporate and then add 1 cup or 225 grams of very cold unsalted butter cubed into three quarter inch pieces pull six to eight times or until you get small pea-sized balls all throughout the flour add that to a large bowl and then while constantly stirring stream in one cup or 240 milliliters of buttermilk once you get a rough dough roll that out onto a work surface and gently knead together until you barely get dough mass now listen every time you touch the stove with your hands you're just ruining everything you love so at this point let the rolling pin do the work roll your rough dough out into a half inch thick rectangle or sort of a rectangle fold it like a letter into thirds repeat that rolling and folding one more time and then at this point it's not only gently needed but slightly laminated for better layers roll it out one last time to get a half inch thick rough rectangle then using a circular biscuit cutter cut out as many biscuits as you can place those on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper scrap just gather all that together very nicely gently knead together then roll back out into a half inch thick rectangle cut out more circles now be sure to place those biscuits at least half an inch apart brush their tops with some additional buttermilk and bake it 425 for 10 to 15 minutes or until beautifully puffed and the tops are golden brown optionally after they come out of the oven immediately you can brush them with some melted butter and maybe a small pitch of flaky salt cool in a wire rack and look at that okay next mashed taters start with three pounds or 1.3 kilos of russet potatoes peel and cut into one inch chunks toss in some lightly salted boiling water and boil until just fork tender drain and pass all those through a potato ricer while still hot then in a medium saucepan add one cup 227 grams of unsalted butter one head of garlic cut in half one shallot quarter half a cup 120 milliliters of heavy cream and one cup or 240 milliliters of whole milk heat that until steamy hot and just about to boil and all the butter is melted cut off the heat and let that seep for about 5 minutes now strain half that liquid into your rice potatoes mixed together and add more liquid as needed once you have beautifully velvety mashed potatoes season generously with salt if you put a spoonful that mashed potato in your mouth isn't immediately watering like got dang niagara falls then you got a problem next gravy in a medium saucepan add 4 tablespoons or 56 grams of unsalted butter heat over medium just until melted then whisk in 4 tablespoons of 41 grams of all-purpose flour cook that while continuously stirring for 30 seconds and then whisk in two cups or 480 milliliters of your finest chicken stock this is the exact moment you're gonna want that homemade chicken stock now heat until just beginning to thicken then whisk in one tablespoon or twelve grams of mushroom soup powder seasoning and one teaspoon or four grams of handashi once again cut off the heat and add one sprig of rosemary and three sprigs of time let that sit for 10 minutes remove the herbs and it's done moving on i've said this before coleslaw is underrated because the majority of fast food coleslaw is just abhorrent let's make it right large bowl four cups of green cabbage thinly sliced which is roughly half a head one red onion thinly sliced two carrots grated and to that you'll add two and a half teaspoons or 12 grams of granulated sugar salt and pepper to taste two tablespoons or 20 grams of white distilled vinegar three tablespoons or 50 grams of creme fraiche half a cup 110 grams of mayonnaise tossed together til thoroughly incorporated and it's done it's refreshing you got a little tangle of tartness and just a touch of richness we've made it to the world famous chicken let's be serious here good chicken only comes with great seasoning that includes salt the other thing is not being a wanker and excluding breast please wings thighs drumsticks all are acceptable now large bowl two cups for 475 milliliters of buttermilk one tablespoon or 11 grams of salt one and a half teaspoons or eight grams of two teaspoons or six grams of ground white pepper one tablespoon or six grams of sweet paprika one tablespoon or ten grams of garlic powder whisk all that together then add in four chicken drumsticks and four small bone-in and skin-on chicken thighs feel free to add some wings here if you like toss the coat and let that marinate at room temp for five minutes but ideally overnight in the fridge now for the dredge large bowl add 3 cups or 450 grams of all-purpose flour and enter the one and only [Music] first teaspoons or six grams of fresh ground black pepper two and a half tablespoons or 28 grams of kosher salt one and a quarter tablespoon or 18 grams of msg two tablespoons or 18 grams of ground white pepper one tablespoon or six grams of ginger powder two teaspoons or five grams of celery powder one tablespoon or 12 grams of garlic powder 2 tablespoons or 12 grams of sweet paprika 2 teaspoons or 0.8 grams of dried oregano 2 teaspoons or 1 gram of dried thyme 1 tbsp or 6 grams of mustard powder whisk all that together and you have your dredge the rest is simple get a heavy bottom pot with at least 2 inches of oil without going more than halfway up the pot heat to around 330 fahrenheit bread your chicken by first drizzling a few tablespoons of your marinade into the flour and tossing to create tiny little balls of dredge in there remove your chicken from the marinade and then toss and press your chicken into the dredge until each piece is coated edge to edge now repeat with all your chicken and once everything is beautifully breaded in two to three batches gently lay your chicken into your hot oil and fry for six to eight minutes or until beautifully deep golden brown and your chicken is just cooked through now drain on a wire rack and repeat with all of your chicken now we're finally done this is a feast but we do need a bucket so buck it down add in your chicken pieces nicely now you just need to serve with your mashed taters gravy slaw and your stunning biscuits for a soon to be unforgettable experience but let's not forget the challenge here how did we fare against kfc let's taste test and find out start with these goddamn mashed potatoes after all this we're starting with that good god it's okay you don't need them i have nothing to say the chicken did the talking for me the gravy good lord both gravies are good this is sort of like a sheet of paper and this is like a leonardo da vinci painting look i'm gonna be honest with you i'm not eating that now these have uh gone completely cold but whatever biscuits are a little dry when they go cold by the way these were warm when i had them just so you know you just dunk them that is nuts this is a family table dinner and this is hospital food now we bring on a taste tester to finalize this boat a lot of elements here to taste vikram so we're gonna make this quick mashed potato number one okay mashed potato number two choo choo that's the better one chicken leg number one okay chicken leg number two it's easy look you don't have to eat the coleslaw you don't have to there's a part of me that knows i don't want to eat it but i also feel like no one's eating it and i should give it that chance here's number one very good slime number two what you don't even know which one this is vikram [Music] yep not even worth swallowing the first one is way better i just don't know why it's sour this is so gross so it's biscuit time both biscuits are quite dry let's get everyone all right number two mmm save this one for later here's number one gravy number two second one's miles better that is yours the first one is good you can definitely tell msg heavy gravy but like the depth of flavor on the second one is just like over here what would be good is like opening one of these oh yeah tear that off and then do this like that and then the gravy on there like that kfc's timbers are shivered kfc more than shimmer shimmer tippers or whatever they're sh themselves but you want to know what else itself b-roll [Music] [Music] [Music] you

don't you forget we got papa toppa boom still available limited time only go get it link in the description so today we are making the hawaiian mixed plate also known as the hawaiian plate lunch what is this it is very simple anybody can make this and should make this if there's anywhere you want to start on your culinary experience that has a close tie to chefs a close tie to a strong culture that's easy to make this is that item it's got so much flavor it's gonna pick up your face and ain't gonna know what the hell hit you it's usually gonna be done with teriyaki style chicken or maybe pork sometimes beef rice and this is where it gets a little interesting a macaroni salad somehow these three items this holy trifecta creates one of the best combos i can possibly imagine in rice bowl history so with all that being said let's make this shall we this is like the meat in three of hawaii but if one of the three was just another meat now we've got our rice macaroni salad hawaiian teriyaki chicken and an undeniably crunchy porkatsu first let's talk rice so it's gonna be two and a half cups or 450 grams of washed short grain rice pop that into a rice cooker cover with two and a half cups or 600 milliliters of water close your rice cooker and let it rip after a few magical moments you'll be greeted with beautifully cooked and textured rice okay macaroni salad trust me on this you do not skip the macaroni salad in a plate lunch bring a pot of water to a boil season generously with salt add one pound or 450 grams of macaroni and cook for about one to two minutes less than the recommended amount of time because you want this al dente drain the pasta and rinse with cold water until completely cooled now add to a large bowl 2 cups are 440 grams of good mayonnaise 2 carrots grated 2 ribs of celery very finely diced 3 cloves of garlic very finely chopped salt and pepper to taste 2 tbsp or 28 grams of apple cider vinegar in one tablespoon or 12 grams of shiradashi mix together until combined and then add in your cooked macaroni and fold together until fully incorporated and that's your max salad this is best if you chill it in the fridge overnight before serving next teriyaki mommy chicky yeah i'm sorry about that that was not good first you'll need two pounds of boneless and skinless chicken thighs cut those into bite size cubes and then in a separate large bowl add three quarters of a cup 180 milliliters of pineapple juice three quarters of a cup 180 milliliters of dark soy sauce three tablespoons of 42 grams of rice vinegar half a cup 110 grams of light brown sugar whisk together until the sugar's dissolved and then add two to three thai chilies thinly sliced a two inch knob of ginger grated then add all of your chicken mix together to coat fully and marinate covered ideally overnight in the fridge once marinated strain your chicken through a large mesh strainer reserve the liquid and now heat a large wok over very high heat add in about three tablespoons of vegetable oil half your chicken syrup tossing occasionally until the chicken has some nice color and is cooked through place the cooked chicken into a bowl set to the side and repeat with the other half once that's cooked remove then add roughly half your marinade to your now empty wok bring to a heavy boil and reduce for 2 minutes or just until it begins to slightly thicken then simply whisk together 1 tablespoon or 9 grams of corn starch and 1 tablespoon or 12 grams of water until homogeneous start by adding half of that cornstarch slurry to your boiling sauce and once it thickens determine whether or not you need to add more slurry to thicken it further now add all your chicken back toss to coat cut off the heat add two cloves of fairy finely chopped garlic and toss the coat once more that's done move on to the katsu which is arguably easier you need four pork chops about one inch thick each ideally a nice heritage chop will get you a better tasting and more intramuscular fat remove from the bone if needed beat your meat until it's about half an inch thick and spread out nicely season generously with salt to taste then get your three-tier katsu breading setup going one medium bowl with one and a half cups or 225 grams of all-purpose flour another medium bowl with three eggs plus a splash of water beaten together till homogeneous and finally two cups or 150 grams of panko bread crumbs this is the easiest thing to bread in the world okay first you go in the flour coat all sides dust up the excess fit into the egg mixture coating every little crevice and finally press aggressively into the panko breadcrumbs until you get a beautiful crust so good it practically already looks crispy now get a frying vessel like a six quart dutch oven filled with enough vegetable oil to give you around two inches of depth heat to 350 fahrenheit and then plunge one to two katsu at a time carefully laying away from you and fry for three to five minutes or until a beautifully golden brown and the inside of your pork is just cooked through around 150 fahrenheit now pull it up from the oil with a spider drain onto a wire rack and while it's still piping hot season immediately to taste with salt and a light sprinkling of shimmy togarashi now assembly is specific but simple first you're gonna need an ice cream scoop with the click release button put not one but two scoops of rice onto your plate followed by one generous scoop of macaroni salad of course a little bit of green onion on your macaroni salad is fine as well then a generous scoop of teriyaki chicken and last but not least your porkatsu sliced beautifully and as for the meat the serving size is up to you and how much you can eat now let's taste test and maybe have a bed nearby in the event we need to take a nap until the next day the hawaiian mixed plate also known as the hawaiian plate lunch or vice versa whichever you prefer only eat this if you have either a worked out or b plan to go to sleep one of my favorite meals of all time and has everything you could possibly want it is carbohydrate heavy protein meat heavy one of my favorite things teriyaki chicken pork katsu rice macaroni seems a little out of place but it's never had a better home dress it up how you want you can have it as is or get a little bit of a nice katsu sauce would do well i don't care what you say i love macaroni salad a little bit of pork quack quack this is my top three rice bowls depending on my mood this is number one at the list but it has just about every texture and flavor you could want and of course it has that nice rice fluffed up beautiful chewy but also somehow light the chicken's rich salty it's got a little bit of sweetness garlicky and of course the porkatsu is just super meaty and savory and crunchy so where the hell does the mac salad come in it's a palette cleanser this is hot spicy warm and then all of a sudden there's a cool refreshing little there couldn't be a better combination of ingredients on a single plate hawaiians we thank you we love you but you want to know what else we think and love b-roll [Music] [Music]

crew neck we're almost like three quarters of the way done all this stuff is freshly cooked it hasn't been sitting for an hour or whatever it's not about better i'm just trying to make a point chop some cilantro the rice is nearly done you know it's funny i feel like some of the greatest flavors i've ever made was in a rush my seasoning tends to be the most accurate when i'm moving quickly so i'm scared it works every time like a goddamn charm look at that fastest rice in history also that's already in a bowl you want to speed this up even more paper towels just enough of a barrier a little bit of butter in lime juice mix that up until it's all coated it's super hot so it's going to melt the butter nicely i'm going to hit that with a little bit of salt to season it got lime juice in there so it can take a little extra salt add our cilantro in oh lovely you know i was nervous about this one no i'm not all rice is nice real nice you know what i just dropped my phone i really like burrito bowls and i kind of want to eat the one i just got i think if i eat a little bit you'll know steak might be a little overcooked so i'm being totally honest oh that's not bad at all it's a

good dollop i like putting dollops of sauce on things but it always looks pretty ugly what do chefs do when they make something a little ugly they use micro greens we're not going to use micro greens because that wouldn't be very fair so we're going to use a little bit of cilantro i almost like want to like just lie and say that they won because i feel bad for them and then of course we finish it with a touch of fresh maldon you know it really grinds my gears is when i show up obviously you won't bro why are you drinking a cup of wine what's up with that bro cheers gentlemen yeah oh oh are you

Additional...",2022-12-02 21:59:44.385768, ever had an incredible steak dinner and then put it in a sandwich and then had it for this price that is but cheaper [Music] when you go out on the town oh i'm gonna go get a steak sandwich and on average you're paying this and at a steak house you're paying this what the the reason why this sandwich is this instead is because we have technique we look at all the arrays of meats wow that's a lot of meat up there and we choose not only the cheapest but the most idealistic cut that we can make as beautifully as possible with technique and care with all that being said let's make this shall we a stick sandwich like this is quite simple in terms of the list of elements within its tight buns or well toast in this case you got the bread the boof of course and all the toppings including a wee cheese sauce first bread i don't care if it's about cheaper but better one of them god dang tweeters making your own bread is the greatest way for the ultimate eating experience for any sort of a sandwich or dining experience doesn't matter and guess what brother it's almost always the most economical at the same time it's almost like it was made for a butt cheaper right large bowl add in 750 grams of all-purpose flour 17 grams of fine sea salt 45 grams of whole wheat flour mix all that together until thoroughly combined separately i got 562 grams of filtered water around 95 degrees fahrenheit oh my gosh josh how many grams what about cups well don't you worry we have conversions if you go to the link at the bottom of the description to that whisk in four grams of mince and yeast don't try and get fancy and add more yeast okay just this amount once dissolved pour your yeast juice into your flour mixture and mix by hand until you get a relatively shacky dough rest your dough for 10 minutes then give it a nice slap and fold or you can knead it in the bowl like this by picking it up and slapping it against the bowl sort of in a scooping motion until it begins to turn relatively smooth cover with plastic wrap and rest for 15 minutes then grab a small piece of the dough near the edge of the bowl stretch it as much as you can without tearing it and fold over the dough repeat all the way around the perimeter of the dough till you reach your original starting point cover it again and rest for 15 more minutes repeat that stretch and fold process including the wait time two more times then cover it up one more time rise at room temp for one and a half hours and then pop it in the fridge overnight the next day you're gonna take it out and do not punch it down this time right he gets to live using a dough scraper carefully sweeper your dough onto a work surface it will be very sticky okay so where some practice is gonna come in split your dough into two even pieces pre-shape each piece into a light ball by carefully scraping underneath your dough with your bench scraper while simultaneously slowly rotating it to generate tension leave it to rest uncovered for 15 minutes then one piece at a time dust the top generously with flour carefully flip the floured side down onto the board exposing the sticky side stretch and fold the left side over to the middle then the right side over the left fold fold the bottom towards the middle and then finally stretch the top up and down to the base now optionally you can stitch the sides together over one another to create more tension gently roll it from the top to the bottom so the seam now faces down towards the board now gently drag it an inch or two towards you quarter turn repeat that pull towards you again pour the turn yet again repeat the pull quarter turn pull until you go around the whole got dang doe and now you have a taut pool carefully pick that up and pop it into a bowl that's been lined with a generously floured cleaned kitchen towel or of course a banaton with a banaton liner also dusted with flour repeat that with your other piece of dough then cover tightly with plastic wrap and rise at room temp for 1-2 hours or until while that's rising pop a heavy bottom pot or dutch oven with a lid into the oven let it heat to 500 degrees fahrenheit or whatever your oven max is for at least one hour this needs to be something thick and heavy like cast iron and if you don't have that well then borrow one from a family member or go buy bread at the store and honestly it probably won't add much price but it will most likely take away some flavor anyway once your dough is proofed pull out your piping hot dutch oven carefully you know probably using gloves would be a good idea dust your dough with flour and then carefully invert it into the bottom of your dutch oven being careful not to score the ever loving out of yourself optionally using a razor blade score the top of your dough in sort of an x shape cover with the lid and place back in the oven for 20 minutes then remove the lid reduce the heat to 450 and bake for another 15 minutes uncovered or until a deep burnished brown now remove it place on a wire rack to cool the room temp place your dutch oven or cast iron back in the oven with its lid to preheat for another 15 minutes and repeat with your other loaf all right for the steak element look this is tough because most steaks are going to put you out of the price range no matter what you do unless you know the butcher you can give them a little kiss for a nice discount that is until i discovered the beef chuck tender roast it's the solution to the chewy eye round that nobody really wants and you're gonna need about two and a half pound or one kilo piece optionally you can tie it off at three to four intervals across the whole length of the roast to help it cook evenly season then generously salt and pepper to taste now get yourself a medium sized pan add just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan heat to medium high until ripping hot add your roast sear for two minutes per side until beautifully crusted and browned deeply then pop that bad boy into an oven set to 225 for about 45 minutes or until the internal temperature hits around 132 fahrenheit remove from the oven and rest for 15 minutes before slicing now while that's resting let's make our toppings first off do not disrespect the humble peppers and onions specifically referred to as peppers onions it's an undefeated combo for many things so get yourself a 12 inch pan with just a vegetable oil to coat the bottom heat that over medium-high until hotter than it was before more specifically nearly smoking add in one sliced onion one green bell pepper sliced into half inch wide strips saute until it starts to develop some color then season a taste of salt and pepper continue to saute until just softened next mushroom quite literally one pound or 450 grams of cremini mushrooms sliced and yet again 12 inch pan over medium high until searing hot add in your mushrooms and sear aggressively stirring occasionally for four to six minutes or until you get some good color on those mushroom and they're nearly cooked through season a taste of salt and pepper reduce the heat to medium and continue to cook another minute or so until beautifully cooked to your liking now set that stuff to the side move on to the sauce a cheddar-based mornay sauce let's keep this classy medium saucepan add one tablespoon or 14 grams of unsalted butter set to medium heat once melted add in one tablespoon or nine grams of all-purpose flour cook stirring often for 30 seconds whisk in one cup 120 milliliters of whole milk then continuously heat and stir until it begins to thicken cut the heat off and then whisk in one cup of 65 grams of grated cheddar cheese and continue whisking until completely melted and smooth add a touch of salt and pepper to taste and that's a basic but fulfilling cheddar cheese sauce look you can always add other stuff to it if budget allows all right but this is bud cheaper time for assembly slice your rusted roast thick or thin but ideally enough to get all the servings here which is gonna be about six to eight servings i will note that there's a line of sinew that runs through the middle of the roast here so i cut the roast in half against that to remove the sinew and then slice the beef against the grain next slice your beautifully crusty loaf of bread into half inch thick slices toast each slice on one side in a pan with butter or in a toaster even a broiler if you got it until toasted to your desired level you want a nice sort of golden brown crunchy depth on that side but still now starting with the untoasted sides add a light spread of mayonnaise on both slices and if you don't like it then be sure to go ilyeki in the comments follow with a generous spoonful of your cooked mushrooms layer on some of your sliced beef a nice stack of your peppers and onions and lastly a light drizzle of your cheddar sauce top with the other slice of bread toasted side facing up of course and this just looks beautiful that's a stick sandwich i'd pay 15 freaking dollars for by golly i might even pay more but you're only gonna have to pay this per serving now we know this has to be good but what about that beef huh does it live up to my standard let's find out we could channel our inner julia child no stick steak sandwich wow look at that immediately when i put this together my first thought is i paid 15 for that hell i paid 20 for that oh yeah i want you to close your eyes take a seat singing a nice dinner table candlelight you're waiting for your loved one they're on the way or if you're single sorry smell the meats emanating in the air plate comes down it's a beautiful steak juicy wait a minute it's a sandwich oh there's peppers and onions and cheese and all sorts of wild things and it's this sandwich you wouldn't have been able to tell the damn difference and for this price right here you'll never have a sandwich this gourmet for that but

what's that just chilling there august 10th okay so today we are making the one and only cheez-it there's all sorts of different iterations but you know what i'm talking about original is this something that people are gonna make at home probably not but what was surprising was this is probably one of the easiest fastest butt betters we've ever done but we should point out one important thing if you ever wanted the giant cheez-it from the taco bell tostada thing that everyone was freaking out about for a little bit now you can so with all that being said let's make this shall we we're at target the three-point test it's target but this one's huge though appearance wise i'm gonna give it an eight out of ten everything else is a two out of ten it's target five out of ten for having good shirts hey yo they got about card skelator do they not have cheez-its the irony of it having like its own aisle basically these are for kevin kevin really likes them extra toasty all right let's go we got the box there's two here the extra toasty should just be the original and then just throw this away the key to opening these boxes by the way i'm tired of seeing people just go this little thing you gotta keep the tab on finger under in like opening an envelope clean i'm sorry but that was solid a fart in my face all right next time you open cheese it's open them and smell immediately i guarantee you fart let's at least define the difference between the two of these regular yeah sorry extra toasty way to burn 15.8 flavor increase that's it less sharp tartness from the cheddar because they killed it off cheez-its are all right i like them i can eat them in most cases the time that they're meant to be eaten is when you are either intoxicated or you're in southern california and maybe you have just eaten the wrong gummy bear no this is unfamiliar to me i got the data that i need so can we make it better yeah look if we're gonna make a cheese that we're doing it right it feels wrong to make this without actual proper cheese little cheddar a little emmental it's a good time now you can totally use a large bowl with an electric beater but i'm using a stand mixer to the bowl add a quarter cup or 54 grams of unsalted butter seven ounces or 200 grams of grated sharp cheddar cheese that's room temperature and please don't use the pre-shreddage because that's a big no kiss fold that with one ounce or 28 grams of grated broom tap and mental cheese 2 teaspoons or 6 grams of nutritional yeast optionally 1 tablespoon or 4 grams of cheddar cheese powder link in the description for where i get mine 1 teaspoon or 5 grams of fine sea salt a light pinch of paprika for color now just let that mix on medium speed until smooth and homogenized as possible once you have a nice paste add in three quarters of a cup or 112 grams of all-purpose flour let that mix using your spatula to loosen any of the paste from the bottom of the bowl and once you get a nice crumbly look you'll then add two to three tablespoons or 28 to 37 grams of ice water just until you form a nice dough mass form that into a thick disk wrap in plastic wrap and place in the fridge to chill for one hour try to be proactive here and preheat that oven to 375 while you're waiting then pull it out divide it into two even pieces and one piece at a time roll the dough into a rough rectangle that's as thin as you can get it around 1 6 to 1 8 of an inch now for the easiest part cut this as big or as small as you like my recommendation is to use a five wheel stainless steel cutter like this for pasta but of course a knife works as well i made my cuts in such a way that i would get one and a half by one and a half inch squares because i want mine big now pop those bad boys onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet repeat with the other piece of dough then using chopsticks poke a hole right in the middle of each cracker then one baking sheet at a time bake these bad boys for about 15 minutes or until they are very lightly toasted around the edges and stiff pull out of the oven immediately season the taste with salt and cool on a wire rack repeat with your other baking sheet and look at that pal you know i was actually pretty shocked with how much these actually look like a cheez-it but hopefully ours tastes better so let's find out two cheez-its these look a lot more like cheez-its than i anticipated immediately texture 10x not only is the flavor more deep but the texture has many many maybe this is just kind of crunchy and crumbly the other one is almost like the mix of a perfect cracker and a nice buttermilk biscuit it's flaky this is what they serve it the ritz carlton it's buttery it's rich you can taste each layer of well the two cheeses but the emental cheese kind of gives a little bit of richness to it it's such a sharp cheddar there's like a rich umami cheese in there and i'm saying but you can't say that without a taste test so in comes kevin b mine is too big kevin will be able to tell thank god cheese and now makes big ones so that should help even the playing field i'm ready open up buddy like a normal person like you're about to put a cheese in your mouth yeah exactly exactly wow number two i don't know if i want number two anymore i would like number one again please there were only two on the board so what's your choice number one number one was incredible i love cheez-its this man is a cheesy aficionado every single day that he comes to work all he eats is almonds and cheez-its that's it and the crazy thing is he's not farting it's silent as someone who loves cheez-its the normal cheez-it tasted like plywood compared to number one your cheez-it three-dimensional it was five-dimensional not skipped four dimensions it was just everything i wanted i could feel the cheese flavor it felt like it came straight off of a cheese tree it really is the difference between a frozen meal and a nicely cooked meal and i didn't expect something like that from cheez-its i was blown away by them incredible review incredible thank you kevin this seems very basic we shouldn't stop here we've all seen the toast data circulating on twitter and everything we can do better than that now obviously you can cut these into regular-sized cheez-its and boom it's a cheesy but better but we're here for the big dog the tostada from here you'll cut the dough into four and a half inch by four and a half inch squares either with a knife but ideally a fluted dough cutting wheel so it's the size of a tostada but square pop those onto a baking sheet lined with parchment you can fit about three to a sheet then optionally you can lightly score the center of each cracker kind of like you would a pie crust to prevent it from puffing too much repeat with all of your dough then bake for about 15 minutes or until the edges begin to toast and the cracker is stiff let this cool completely on a wire rack i just want to show this one piece off do not score too long or too deep otherwise you will end up with it splitting like this in a moment of silence for this cheez-it while that's cooling let's get our taco bell beef topping going medium-sized sauce pot set over medium high lightly spray the bottom with oil to prevent sticking add in 1 pound or 450 grams of ground beef around 70 lean press that bad boy down for that full contact sear for two to three minutes season a taste with salt flip sear another minute then using a hand masher crush your beef over and over until you get fine crumbles continue to cook at medium high stirring occasionally then once you get some nice crispy bits in that pot add in half a small white onion finely chopped and three cloves of garlic very finely chopped season to taste again with salt sir and let that cook just until the onion begins to soften about two to three minutes then add in two tablespoons or 34 grams of tomato paste stir till distributed then let that cook for 1 minute then add in 1 tablespoon or 7 grams of smoked paprika half a teaspoon or 2 grams of ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon or 2 grams of ground cumin and 1 teaspoon or 32 grams of ancho powder cook stirring often for 30 seconds or until very fragrant lastly add in 1 cup or 240 milliliters of good beef broth bring to a boil scrape that fond off the bottom of the pan reduce the temperature to low and simmer until all the liquid is gone about seven to ten minutes now you have what i'd call feeling ideal for gordita maybe an enchilada or in this case some sort of odd cheez-it tostada next jalapeno emulsion crema snag yourself five jalapenos throw those bad boys from edge to edge over an open flame pop into a bowl cover with plastic wrap for three to four minutes then remove from the bowl wipe off the charred skin with a paper towel remove their stems and pop the whole peppers into the blender seeds and all i really encourage you to try it with the seeds the spice gets quite mellowed next add the juice of one lime seven cloves of garlic blend on high until extremely smooth then while that's continuously blending stream in three tablespoons of 42 grams of vegetable oil and once that's emulsified in it's done now get a separate bowl add three quarters of a cup 165 grams of mayonnaise half a cup 110 grams of sour cream all of your jalapeno emulsion season a taste with salt whisk to combine and your creamy green is ready to do naughty things to that tostada all of your other toppings are pretty basic thinly sliced iceberg lettuce diced avocado one nice tomato diced as well now we assemble tostada down followed by a couple generous spoonfuls of your beef a light generous drizzle of your crema you should also serve a ramekin for this on the side trust me a generous handful of your thinly sliced lettuce some diced tomato diced avocado and look this part bothers me to absolutely no end but i'm gonna do it to mimic taco bell's weird cold cheese on top but just for a second like why cover that up with a few nice leaves of fresh cilantro and i'm not gonna lie i'm a big fan of how this turned out it's sort of like a re-imagination of what a tosada should look like but now we need to see how we did here we are with the tosada of the age conceptually i like this the square i kind of would have liked into a circle like an actual tostada but you know it's a cheez-it so oh [Music] pretty good you know what if this just had a little bit of extra acid you put a little lime juice on this i would argue but this is a pretty ideal tostada it makes a lot of sense right it's kind of like the cheese wrapping something we've got that toasted cheese flavor and the crunch from the tostada and then of course all the other toppings you would expect the meat is rich it's anxious it's fatty we've won this is gonna be weird taste test i'm not really sure how we're gonna do this so i think someone should just come in take a bite tell us what they think oh oh my god it was incredible that's absolutely amazing it's got great texture it's like a mixture between like crumbly and like flaky come on it's a big cheez-it it's that sharp cheddar and emmental thank you i don't feel like i have to talk about the meat it's literally beef chicken onions it's good i feel like this is more about the cheez-it than it is about anything else so we already beat that at the beginning so we're beating it two times over the horse is dead and then we're like ah take that cheez-it oh just kidding the horse is okay oh he's back along just kidding it was never the horse that was dead it was actually taco bell i'm gonna get out of here whoa that was even like an aftershock all right so you heard it here big cheez-it there's nothing wrong with it you can put anything on it and it's going to be great i'll tell you one thing you make this and it's definitely going to be better than taco bells you know what else is better than taco bell's b-roll [Music] [Music]

coming just for you [Music] i know you've waited a long time for this and i want to give it to you i'm going to give it to you you wanna get notified link in the description august 10th next butt faster i'll see you there okay so today we are making not just some fast food calzone all right there's more to it animal style fries bacon cheeseburger and a chicken nugget meal there's this yearning question of somehow i feel like this could be good so with all that being said let's make this shall we look this is a big step off from what we normally do but it's something that seemed like it needed to be explored we have three calzones the first one being a classic at any self-respecting and let's be honest also non-self-respecting burger establishments a bacon cheeseburger followed by animal style fry and finally a chicken nugget inspired version each of these have some tradition which has been utterly defiled by the idea of a fast food concept or has it let's at least start off with a traditional base a neapolitan dough which to make me feel better we're going to do this dough all in grams whisk together 3 grams of instant yeast into 512 grams of water that's around 95 fahrenheit until dissolved separately snag yourself 80 grams of double o tipo flour it was skin 16 grams of fine sea salt until combined mix your yeasty juices into the dry and stir until you get a shaggy dough from there just knead that for about three to five minutes until you get a relatively smooth and supple dough now lightly coat the bottom of your bowl with super duper virgin olive oil cover with plastic wrap and pop in the fridge overnight overnight josh yes overnight if you're going to take something traditional and try to make it fast food you could at least let the dough get some gut dang flavor dip all right now once the dough has had a nice rest a little sleepy head now punch it down brother and divide it into six even pieces about 250 grams each roll each piece into a rough ball placed in a floured pizza proofing box or baking sheet cover with a lid or another inverted baking sheet and let it proof at room temp for three to four hours wow well since that has some time to proof instead of playing fortnite until your retinas burn out of your skull let's get to work if you're going the burger route let's begin with their patties which in this context feels only correct in the form of my i mean meatballs in a large bowl add one pound or 450 grams of ground beef half a cup of 36 grams of panko bread crumbs one and a half teaspoons or 10 grams of fine sea salt half a sweet onion finely chopped mix and need until thoroughly combined and you want it to be a bit tacky and bouncy bouncy tacky meat you know everyone's favorite pastime now line a baking sheet with parchment grease it up then using your cookie scoop scoop out as many pieces of your meat onto the baking sheet once that's done roll each chunker into a perfect little ball all the way down your sheet organize them nicely you should be able to fit all of them onto one tray now pop that into an oven set to 400 degrees fahrenheit ideally on convection if you have it for 16 to 18 minutes until a beautifully browned crust is formed around fully cooked yet juicy juicy meatballs now moving on to the sauce let's make a quick point this is not and never should be called a tomato sauce and i'm not just saying that for the italians okay it's gonna seem wrong until i make it right and even then it might seem a little weird right medium sauce pot add two tablespoons or 16 grams of olive oil turn it to medium heat once hot add in five cloves of rough chopped prosciutto four cloves of thinly sliced garlic and saute just until fragrant and lightly toasted about one to two minutes then add a six ounce or 170 gram can of tomato paste saute till it starts to caramelize about a minute then add two tablespoons or 24 grams of sugar yeah yeah i know okay i can hear the italians from here now salted taste a third cup or 80 milliliters of water to deglaze then simmer and reduce until thickened about five minutes during occasionally unless you want to burn it at the bottom of the pot now just let that cool completely in a bowl and once cool add in one cup or 220 grams of mayonnaise stir took a mine and you sort of have something reminiscent of a burger sauce that was simultaneously meant for a frankenstein experimental calzone the rest of the burger elements are of course bacon and cheese and you can add any other elements you want so let's go and make our other fillings next all right animal style fries actually use the exact same recipe for my in and out animal style fries but better video link in the description for that see you like that plug it's pretty good but to put it simply it of course is rusted potatoes cut through this thing which i impulse bought so matchsticks soaked in a light brine drained dried off lightly fried drained again oil temperature increased and fried again until crispy and lightly golden pulled out it was salt and of course the massive iconic fan favorite in-n-out spread which by the way let me just take a second and say thank you so much for all your love and respect you guys give not just to me but these recipes not only are you making them but they've become regulars in your home just means the world to me really i love you so much big kiss nah bowl mayo ketchup dijon worcestershire sire sauce chives one diced to be good one caramelized onion garlic grated salt and pepper to taste whisk until combined and cry tears of in and out spread joy angel singing from afar trumpets blasting in air this is a sauce although not usually for a calzone hopefully it's not awful okay next and final a chicken nugget combo meal look let's just do this without holding back starting with everyone's least favorite the slaw half had a green cabbage very thinly sliced if you want to use a mandolin death trap feel free to follow with two carrots grated half a bunch of chives thinly sliced one clove of garlic grated the zest and juice of one lemon ah that's a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of buttermilk i swear salted taste half a cup 110 grams of mayonnaise pepper to taste not sure why i segmented the salt and pep there but anyway sauce together and slaw wow now for the sauce i figured we could roll with essentially a cane sauce which is three quarters of a cup 150 grams of mayo god just an unreasonable amount of mayo in this episode five tablespoons are 90 grams of ketchup one and a half tablespoons or 18 grams of worcestershire sauce ooh got it there salted taste three cloves of garlic grated fresh pepper to taste whisked together and that's quite literally it the chicken recipe is pretty basic one and a half pounds or 680 grams of chicken thighs and skinless cut into bite-sized pieces in a small bowl add 3 tablespoons or 32 grams of kosher salt one half teaspoons or seven grams of um three quarters of a teaspoon or two grams of sugar whisk together till combined and season your chicken generously with your cure and let it sit for about seven minutes cover with plastic wrap at room temp to very lightly cured for the dredge 2 cups are 300 grams of all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons or 21 grams of garlic powder half a teaspoon or 2 grams of msg 2 teaspoons or 6 grams of paprika 1 tablespoon or 11 grams of powdered sugar a touch of salt to taste mix together token mine then in a separate bowl make your dredge with two eggs and one cup or 240 milliliters of whole milk whisk until combined and dredging these works like this each piece of chicken will first get tossed in a light coating of your flour mixture shake off the excess coat in your egg mixture then back into the flour to go completely edge to edge once it looks nice place on a baking sheet and repeat with all of your nuggets and the rest is simple in batches fry your chicken in a pot of vegetable oil set to around 350 fahrenheit and do me a favor as i've said please don't fill your pot above halfway with oil this isn't even about a papa kiss all right it's about your safety pal and if you don't care about your safety then maybe don't make chicken nuggets remove your chicken nuggets from the oil place in a wire rack and hit them with salt to taste okay we're ready it's time to assemble pull a piece of proof dough place on a generously floured work surface dust your big old plump ball with flour then using a rolling pin roll it out into a sort of a vague rectangle about ten inches long and seven inches wide and this is the base of each calzone now first our bacon cheeseburger working from the bottom third of your rectangle leaving a slight border and a nice smear of your tamaoli which is really nothing like an aioli but it's fine sounds good follow with your meatballs which each of them have cut in half add as little or as many as you like just try not to overstock this follow that with fresh sliced tomato and yes we're salting to taste optionally fresh or pickled onion a slice or two of cooked bacon and a sliced cheese of choice this is white cheddar fold your empty top over your filled bottom half crimp your calzone shut all the way and please make sure it's fully sealed there's nothing worse than your calzone tube now now to all your dang feeling all right next animal style fries again dough ball roll it out this time a thick smear of your in-n-out spread your fresh crisp homemade fries and for a little extra i added some cube to legio but of course to keep this as wrong full as this is two slices of american cheese another dollop of your in and out spread and lastly more caramelized fold and crimp and then on to our final calzone yet again dough roll it out this time add cane sauce and really to make this a true chicken nugget meal you gotta add french fries which we happen to have left over from the animal fries followed by a nice row of your chicken a layer of your coleslaw and finally three to four slices of provolone cheese fold and crimp now optionally you can score your calzones three times and now we're ready to bake dust a pizza peel generously with flour plop a calzone on it and launch it into a pizza oven set to 560 degrees fahrenheit for about one minute rotating often until just cooked through and beautifully burnished like this but for the record you can totally do this in a regular oven with a baking steel or even an inverted baking sheet if you don't have one just make sure that you preheat your oven on max for at least 30 minutes before baking and bake closer to like seven or ten minutes and all that matters is they look beautiful puffed a little bit of char and ready to be taste tested let's just hope that this wasn't a complete waste of time first up our borgore i mean it kind of looks like a burger wow right away that nice like tooth some chewy pizza texture is throwing it off a little bit because my brain is kind of going oh is that a pizza wait a minute is that a burger i'm confused but i like it it doesn't taste exactly like a burger but it does taste nice all right on to the animal style fries oh yeah this is completely different than i expected first off imagine a pizza got that image in your head and then a calzone you're chewing your eating and you're like did i just eat an animal style fry and then your brain is like switching again back and forth between pizza french fry pizza animal style pizza in and out god damn all right last one chick-fil-a cane sauce french fry combo holy sh look at there's a piece of fried chicken in there cheese and a stack of french fries what do you think i'm gonna say about this this is probably one of my most favorite calzone i've ever put in my mouth and i know it feels wrong the culinary part of my brain says no but the human side the unbiased side the thing that only cares about the immediate thought of good or not good this is good this has a place on the table maybe not an italian table i know the italians are freaking out you want to know what's not freaking out beware [Music] [Music] you

Get My Cookbook: http://bit.ly...",2022-12-01 21:59:44.385768, normally when we order chicken tikka masala but we don't worry about it because it tastes good but you can have it possibly better for this that is but cheaper cheaper [Music] so I've been feeling this is gonna be a bit of a challenge because this is a heavy spice recipe and spices kind of jack up the price of things so not everybody has the spice on hands they got to go buy one and then we gotta factor in the whole bottle oh so we're gonna have to delete spices and somehow configure and mechanize this into a fully functioning robot of flavor I don't know why I'm using mechanization and Robotics to describe this but I know that we can do it we've never backed down from a challenge so with all that being said let's make this shall we this recipe is so fast you might as well call it a God dang butt faster first in a large Vulcan mine one cover 240 grams of full fat yogurt two teaspoons or six grams of kosher salt one and a quarter tablespoon or 11 grams of garam masala oh it's a fancy spice Josh look it encapsulates all the spices you need because then you don't have to buy like four five six however many spices you need one teaspoon or three grams of paprika five cloves of garlic finely chopped two inch knob of fresh ginger grated mix all that together until thoroughly combined then cut two pounds or 900 grams of boneless and skinless chicken thighs pause look we all know chicken thighs are the superior Choice here right first off it's cheaper than the breast second off yeah sure use breast but I'm sick of being Overjoyed with the delightfully flavorful sauce only to bite into a piece of compressed wood sawdust like overcooked chicken breast the thigh will save you from that so please use it and enjoy the juicy tenderness and thank me later anyway mix all that together and loud to sit for 10 minutes at room temp but ideally overnight in the fridge now get yourself a large saute pan or some sort of a large and deep Skillet you could also use a small pot look this is the only cooking vessel you need to use here so you know be kind of choosy but it's fine add just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of a pan heat over medium high until nearly smoking then add all your chicken in batches and sear for two to three minutes per side so you get some nice Browning don't get all like oh gotta cook chicken all the way through it's gonna get cooked later so once everything's seared remove all your chicken add a touch more oil if needed lower the heat to medium add a mix of one large yellow onion sliced a two inch dump of Ginger thinly sliced three cloves of garlic also thinly sliced season lightly with salt to draw that water out it's gonna help it cook faster and saute for three to five minutes or until all the vegetables are softened then add in one teaspoon or three grams of paprika one piece 203 grams of cayenne powder 1 tablespoon or 9 grams of garam masala 2 teaspoons or 9 grams of granulated sugar and saute until so fragrant you can barely just Gap then help yourself then add a 15 ounce or 425 gram can of crushed tomatoes stir that together and let it reduce for five minutes and this next step is optional I want to see in the comments complaining no you don't have a blender look you'll literally be fine if you don't have one just don't blend it anyway once reduced and all your vegetables are super soft pour all that into a blender and blend on high speed until as smooth as physically possible then place it back into the pan or pot or whatever the hell you're using bring it back to a simmer reduce the heat to low add all of your cooked chicken and simmer stirring occasionally for 10 minutes or until the chicken's cooked beautifully then stir in one cup of 240 milliliters of heavy whipping cream and reduce for seven to eight more minutes stirring occasionally or till thickened there's no other way to describe this other than voluptuous now seasoned taste with salt as needed and serve next to a nice big old chunker of plain steamed rice optional you can garnish with cilantro but really you don't need the expenditure if you don't want to and look I'll be honest this looks beautiful but I did have to remove a couple of things that I'd usually put in here to keep the cost down because but cheaper that's why we use garam masala it has the majority of the flavors that you need but if you want it even better and you happen to have it on hand then I would suggest adding one teaspoon of ground cumin to the spice mix but again only if you have it on hand that being said can this still taste as good despite that for the sake of our wallets let's find out so we have chicken tikka masala for this price right here let's just taste the damn thing wow this is great I mean this is equally as good as our other chicken tikka masala recipe I almost don't want to say it because all the people are like yeah cost benefit I'm never gonna make the other one again but this one is just as good even with the reduction of spices you get that strong deeply flavored spice right to the mouth it's creamy but not too creamy mostly tomatoey a little bit tart a little bit spicy you got that Umami from the chicken fat if I ordered this chicken take Masala and they gave to me for 17 I'd be like okay but it was only this but you want to know what else is cheaper b-roll foreign [Music]

Sheet Tray: https://amzn.to/3...",2022-12-01 21:59:44.385768, hot dog has to be one of the cheapest items i can think of unless you go to like a ball game for 10 bucks out the window but today we're making probably one of the most expensive that's ever lived [Music] all right so today we're making a hot dog and a hot dog but they're very different i don't know it's an absurdly expensive hot dog with a plethora of not just luxurious but rare ingredients combined to see if we can make something better than something that i think is probably one of the most basic items that we know it's a little weiner in between basic buns ketchup mustard maybe some relish and that's it can that defeat something as ridiculous as this well there's only one way to find out brother so with all that being said let's make this shall we okay you got a hot sweaty stadium dog and then you have another sitting at a table of calcutta marble and only the finest distilled water at your side or whatever look the basic dog is what it is you need all this stuff hot dog buns you can find at a grocery store your choice of hot dogs we're going all be frank's obviously sear or grill your dogs place them in a warm bun top with ketchup mustard mayo optionally you can add some pickle relish finally dice sweet and well that's really it sure it's simple and it looks exactly as you'd expect but how does our hot dog compare this dog is comprised of completely hand-slashed homemade hot dogs with some of the most rare pork and beef on the planet a king crab dog spruce tip pickled mustard seeds an onion fondue aioli and much more so let's begin and make this quick the bread is straightforward this is the exact same bun recipe for my most recent homemade hot dog video link in the description for that just know that we made these completely from scratch which ultimately actually saved us money so far so not a good start on the expensive aspect here so next up the dog oh my god look who got a new meat grinder you know it's just like they say there's nothing more beautiful than a young soul in his brand new meat grinder now anyway start by grinding a mixture of four pounds or eighteen hundred grams of kurobuta pork two pounds or ninety grams of the finest texas wagyu tri-tip i didn't do a5 because that felt a little too sacrilegious one pound or 450 grams of foie gras that's been sliced scored and seared on both sides and half a pound or 225 grams of pork fat grind all that together and once it's all fully ground run it through your meat grinder one more time to get it extra fine now in a separate large bowl add 72 grams of sausage binder flour 2 teaspoons or 5 grams of ground black pepper 2 and a half tablespoons are 24 grams of smoked paprika 1 tablespoon or 5 grams of ground coriander 1 tablespoon or 12 grams of garlic powder 2 teaspoons or 3 grams of sancho powder 2 tablespoons or 24 grams of salt good lord there's a lot of words 1 tablespoon or 15 grams of brown sugar and exactly five grams of prog powder number one don't get this stuff confused and try to eyeball it or buy a different one this isn't a papa joke okay please be careful so i can continue to scold you now whisk all that together and then mix in three quarters of a cup or 180 milliliters of ice water until you get a nice paste add that to your meat mixture knead together until thoroughly combined and looking lovely like this grab yourself some sheep casings rinse them and let them sit in water for 25 minutes before using hook up a sausage filling attachment to your grinder or stand mixer attachment add on your casing like so and guess what fill her up nice and good i want that thing plump but you don't want it too tight otherwise you'll risk it bursting and when your sausage bursts you didn't want to call the ambulance the flavor ambulance that is so let it hang loose do a little dangle for you do your best to stay as appropriate as possible when you see your sausage just swanging in the twilight then once you've got your casings filled and you got this big long boy pinch it on multiple intervals to the length of hot dog that you want should be around six to eight inches if you can handle that cowboy then just spin each individual link to titan pop that onto a wire rack repeat with the rest and then place in the fridge uncovered overnight then get a smoker rolling at 250 degrees fahrenheit take your sausages out place them inside for 40 minutes or till the sausages are just cooked through pull them out and pop immediately into ice water until completely cold separate your dogs and you have luxury wieners ready for your plump buns next up the mustard seeds two medium sauce pot add half a cup or 82 grams of yellow mustard seeds add enough water just to cover place over medium high and as soon as it comes to a boil strain that through fine mesh strainer place the seeds back into the pan cover again with fresh water and repeat the boiling and rinsing process two more times after you've drained it for the third time add your seeds which should be getting nice and uh thicky wicky by now back to your sauce pot followed by three quarters of a cup or 180 grams of apple cider vinegar a quarter cup of 65 grams of rice vinegar 1 teaspoon or 3 grams of fine sea salt 1 tablespoon or 18 grams of honey set to medium high bring that to a boil and let it cook for about 1 minute then cut off the heat add in 2 to 3 spruce tips and pour into a heat proof container now you're just gonna let those spruce tips steep for at least one hour and up to overnight and of course cool to room temp before refrigerating you silly goose onion fondue aioli sounds fancy but it's also very easy medium sized pan add in 2 tablespoons for 28 grams of unsalted butter heat until melted and bubbling over medium heat add in one sweet onion diced using a taste of salt lower the heat to medium low and cook stirring often for 20 minutes or until lightly caramelized to a nice golden brown i said easy okay not fast anyway add a light splash of your most expensive whiskey a thousand dollar bottle not a bad idea look at this point i'm just trying to add on cost here as soon as that comes to a boil carefully ignite the steam from afar with a blow torch and let it flambe until the flame goes completely out continue to simmer until all the liquid is gone toss adjust salt levels and it's done in a medium sauce pot combine 10 cloves of garlic one and a quarter cup or 300 milliliters of vegetable oil heat it over medium and just let those cook they'll start to bubble simmer whatever you want to call it really it's a comfy and you're just gonna let those cook gently until the garlic is soft and golden don't overdo it strain the garlic out and leave them separate to cool to room temp now to a blender add in your caramelized onion you're cooked now confit and cooled garlic cloves half a cup or 30 grams of parmigiano reggiano a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of lemon juice one egg yolk two tablespoons of 32 grams of dijon mustard blend it on high speed and use just a light drizzle of water to loosen the mixture without watering it down it needs to be thickums all right now once it's blending and vortexing nicely let it rip until as smooth as possible about 15 to 20 seconds and then streaming all of your garlic oil from confiting the garlic earlier uh you cooled it down to room temp right brother because if you didn't cool that down not only are you not gonna get a little peppa but you also break your emulsion and waste all the time that you did with your wouldn't that just be magical now slowly add all that oil until you get a beautiful aioli like emulsion like this season taste of salt and black lime zest yes a lot of exotic stuff replacing typically inexpensive stuff is it worth it i hope pop it into a scrub bottle and set to the side now the king crab dog is actually quite literally just a whole segment of a king crab leg so get your crab meat extracted from at least three to four whole crab legs then in a medium saucepan and half a cup 115 grams of salted butter set to medium heat and let that melt swirling occasionally until the milk salts begin to toast to a golden brown you can even go a little darker than this if you wanted to about two to three minutes add in your crab and no need to heat it up any further just let those sit it's tossing occasionally and let it get to know the ocean of brown butter it is now meant to swim in and as soon as that crab is hot you're ready to assemble sear or grill some of your dogs split your buns toast them on both cut sides beautifully like so split them down the middle like you see here now spread those sweet soft buns for papa and add a thick boy leg of crab to make sure you're filling the whole length of your bun brush with a little extra brown butter that the crab was heated in follow that with your glistening hot weiner a nice drizzle of your onion fondue aioli little dollops of your mustard seeds along the whole dog a generous dollop of platinum cetera caviar all the way down that dog yet again you can go generous here don't be scared and finally some dainty fresh dill to garnish your dog beautifully you ever garnished a hot dog well if you have then good on you honestly this dog does look expensive it really does but is it worth this and can it beat the original boy i i really hope it does because this was expensive this is not a hot dog that's a thot dog and then this is our regular wee-wee not bad okay imagine a hot dog what that tastes like there you go wow the expensive one by far is the winner i'm sorry it just is i've had a million of these and it's a classic flavor and it tastes good but this is like a whole experience what really makes this great is the combination of the crab and the homemade hot dog and the crunch of the mustard seeds and onion fondue all right we have one professional opinion but i like the second one yuma this man has worked in fine dining alongside me before and he's here to taste my wiener i really like it you can feel the smokiness the bread of course just like a lobster roll but with that smoky sausage is really really good it's not like this needs to be super expensive what really makes this great is the addition of the crab the mustard seeds and the onion fondue that is what makes the difference okay but i also don't give a if you make it anyway but you want to know what i do care that you make b-roll [Music] so [Music] [Music] you

We’re making it all homemade with a little bit of *spice*. 

Learn more about what's coming (Papatapa Apparel):...",2022-12-01 21:59:44.385768, look I'll be honest I like the Five Guys they seem nice name one time that's ever stopped us [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey that looks nice doesn't it someone's coming soon something you've asked for for pretty much a year this is more than what you might be imagining this is just the beginning and if you want to stay up to date the link is in the description okay so today we are making the Five Guys it is called Five Guys Burger and Fries all right the fries we can do another time all right I'm saving that for some special I think the main question you can ask is at this point is there really a difference between every burger at every place if you think the answer is that there's no difference you're out of your mind they want their own sort of like Flavor branding you take a bite you know it's a McDonald's burger you take a bite and you know it's a Five Guys burger but is one better than the other and that's the magical argument the element about Five Guys is that everything 's cooked relatively fresh I think that presents a little bit more of a challenge but this is but better so we'll make it better and with all that being said let's make this shall we yes there are a lot of people here I hate these kinds of strip malls I avoid them at all costs I really do I'll be back uh we got the bag honestly I'm having a great day I hope you guys are too okay three-point test I love the interior honestly so we're just gonna judge the interior because they're always in strip malls I'm gonna give it eight out of ten very nice service since we're back in the car service is 10 out of 10 that were very nice and quick nothing negative to say about that menu eight out of 10 for being classic all good ratings now let's begin we got the bag I like this design this is good or bad that's all it needs to be for two burgers and no fries no drink I don't know if everyone was like let me show me I get it I spend a lot of money on food but that's a lot I will say that this burger weighs 400 grams that's a big burger look at that I'm excited about this one Bacon's good toppings are there what I don't like they put the Mayo on the top and then on the bottom they put the other stuff like why not put them both even and out Mayo ketchup mustard boom Mayo ketchup mustard boom you want it in every bite I don't get it still big fans so far cross section very nice I only have good things to say about this place the buns are way too soft though they kind of like just fall apart and when they soak with liquid they're just smells nice God damn it you're so close fatal error is that none of this is seasoned there is no salt in this no matter how fresh all this stuff is there's almost no flavor in this burger whatsoever and I'm so disappointed because I actually like Five Guys this isn't a full demarking but this ain't gonna help you in the end a burger isn't just meat buns Patty there's more to it than that that's why each burger from every joint is different first off these buns are sweeter and eggier than most eggy not a good word but descriptive now here we're working off my cookbook all-purpose bundo with some minor changes Link in the description for that by the way that's a plug so start with three quarters of a cup or 185 grams of whole milk at 90 degrees Fahrenheit whisk in two and a half teaspoons or 10 grams of instant knees till dissolved separately in the bowl of a stand mixer add three cups plus two tablespoons or 469 nice grams of all-purpose flour three and a half tablespoons or 50 grams of granulated sugar and one and a half teaspoons or five grams of fine sea salt mix the dry ingredients to combine then to your milk add one egg yolk and two whole eggs whisk together till homogeneous then pop on a dough hook or spiral attachment begin mixing on medium low and add your liquid let that mix and need for two to three minutes or until you start to get a rough dough then add in three tablespoons or 42 grams of unsalted softened butter mix another two to three minutes or until you get a smooth and extensible dough roll that bad boy into a rough ball pop into a grease Bowl cover with plastic wrap and rise for one and a half hours at room temperature or until doubled look at the little punch it down divided into ton even pieces weighing 80 to 90 grams each roll each of those into balls and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment you're likely gonna need two baking sheets once you have all your balls lightly tent with grease plastic wrap and let that proof at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes or until your balls nearly double now you've all seen this before brush your buns with egg wash consisting of one egg whisk together with a splash of water until smooth hit it with some raw untosted sesame seeds and pop in a 375 degree oven for 15 to 17 minutes until you get beautifully Road tunned glistening Golden Globes practically floating out of the oven they're so light now optionally good brush them with a little melted butter immediately upon removing from the oven and then just let this cool to room temp on a wire rack now this burger has a lot of cook toppings so let's begin with our own get yourself one white onion diced heat a large pan over medium high if that was just enough vegetable oil to cook the bottom of the pan and once that's hot enough to slap your got dang knee I don't know when you'll toss the coat with the oil season it taste with salt and cook tossing occasionally for four to five minutes or until your onions are softened and have developed a nice lightly browned color boom essentially griddled onion popped it to the side clean out the pan and then in that same pan addition of vegetable oil to coat the bottom yet again heat it over medium high and once it is yet again hot enough to sear just about any goddamn thing add in half a pound or 227 grams of fresh shiitake mushrooms that have been stemmed and sliced half an inch thick let those cook and sear against the pan and do not stir or season them yet otherwise they're going to release too much water and they'll go limp I would say most scenarios when things go limp not a good thing right now you really want to treat these a bit like a steak right that's the key to having mushrooms that are so good your friends and family will bow before your mushroom cooking might now once those have a nice golden brown crust you can then season them with salt give them a nice toss and let them continue to sear stirring occasionally until cooked to your liking now you'll notice I only hard seared one side and the reason is we want that nice my yard like flavor but without drying them out if you wanted them seared on both sides you need to slice them thicker which is not ideal for a sandwich anyway those are your mushrooms place in a bowl set to the side and the bacon is pretty straightforward you don't need me to explain that right Choose Your Own Adventure here you're making a lot of bacon put it in the oven if not then you can slap them in a pan and cook them old school style you know flip them over and over until they're done drain on a paper towel see now we need to talk about our pop guys Prides itself on the freshness of its ingredients so although we need two pounds of 900 grams of ground beef obviously I would recommend grinding it yourself do you have to of course not but if you choose to do so I recommend a really nicely marbled boneless chuck roast cut into long strips and fed through a meat grinder and don't ground pretty straightforward now that we have our buff we can cook and assemble Buns of course should be sliced and toasted if you want to have that proper Burger experience come on now it's like a universal rule I don't ever want to see an untosted bun again Papa love you now get yourself roughly a four to five ounce ball of ground beef get a medium-sized Skillet over medium high cut the bottom with just barely enough oil to create a nice slick once the pan begins to smoke add in that one ball of birth grease a large spatula or a press and you get test it press your beef down until it's about one inch wider than your buns and around a half inch thick season that Patty to taste generously with salt and pepper let that syrup hard for one to two minutes get your spatula under the flip and season the other side with salt and pepper again and of course the quintessential slice of American cheese I know blasphemy let it sear for another minute then take it immediately off the pan add your second Patty boom same thing press it down season taste with salt and pep sear clip again salt pep another slice of cheese which you can totally switch up here right you can do American cheese again or you could go cheddar monster I like to mix it up it's kind of boring if you don't right now pick up your older Paddock you made from earlier place the newest one on top of that doing this is gonna help melt that cheese if I step back in the pan reduce the heat to medium and let it sit until both cheeses are melted and now for the Moment of Truth Listen we're making this burger in a way that is called all the way if you don't like your burger all the way get the out of here kidding just you know don't add something you don't like to the Burger there you go right anyway bottom and top bun add a nice generous smear of mayo follow that with a drizzle of yellow mustard both buns and a drizzle of ketchup both buns yet again now begin your style stacking on the bottom bun first a nice shingling of dill pickles that have been sliced lengthwise for maximum sandwich surface area coverage two to three slices of cooked bacon your double Patty oh boy this is looking a bit larger than anticipated one beefy slice of ideally heirloom tomato which yes has been salted some of your seared mushrooms your griddled onion rough chopped iceberg lettuce which honestly doesn't need to be on this burger it does nothing we're doing it for posterity and finally grab your top bun and you better bet your ass it's a royal moment because we're gonna Crown our King for what looks to be a touch larger of a burger than necessary but let's hope its flavor can match its size so that we can find our winner Burger Time Burger Time theirs was a little squished I'll give them that so I'm not going to mark them off points for being ugly but I squeeze this together so it might be a little bit ugly now too but I had to conform it somehow right now that this is one unit an absolute one at that Jesus look at that the verdict is in I'm a big fan of the flat top but if you don't get a good sear these patties have no color at all the crispness of the meat it's seasoned perfectly nice and fatty not too dry they're Meats drier than it usually is and we ground this fresh you can taste the Applewood smoked bacon everything is coming through but more importantly because I salted the goddamn tomato guess what this is balanced bun wise I think this matches up nicely because I remember reading oh this has a little more egg and a little bit more of the sugar and this and that I tried to make a little bit more of a gooey bun and we I think we achieved that so there's some similarities but the freshness of this still shines through season perfectly cooked perfectly I mean this is an easy dub honestly and I didn't think it was going to but we need a taste tester to finalize are you a Five Guys guy I love Five Guys actually used to get it a lot more get these Five Guys in Kendrick's mouth so this is the flat end here I can't see what you're pointing at wow that was number one number Deuce nice first one was better personally and it comes down to flavor there's so much in here there are a lot of really good textures it's so flavorless though there's not an ounce of any kind of seasoning to be found in this Five Guys burger you're a burger a lot of similar textures but I agree your meat is a lot more crisp I got a good sear on it I'll encapsulate this all thank you Kendra I'm gone I'm not here wow what it comes down to Five Guys I'm actually still a big fan today not their best day I'll give them that all they had to do was season it properly and also their meat was low-key kind of dry it had no color on it but that's the difference between something good and bad is technique and you don't have to make your own buns and still make a Better Burger in like what like 15 minutes if you're not making the buns and all the other bowls but you want to know what else doesn't have to make its own buns b-roll [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music]

Today we pit arguably the two most famous together to find an ultimate grilled cheese. 

Get My Cookbook: http://bit.ly/JWCoo...",2022-12-01 21:59:44.385768, you really think america's the only one with the grilled cheese there happens to be a contender so we're gonna find out if there's a winner [Music] [Music] so today we are making an american grilled cheese versus a french grilled cheese now there's really multiple grilled cheese across the whole spectrum of the world right there's the cheese toasty in england which is kind of the exact same thing but they just call it a different word maybe there's a slightly different preparation let us know in the comments but there's also many other versions think about a quesadilla that's not far off from what a grilled cheese is it's just a different vessel of starch if you will the closest but most significant comparison is the proc monsieur it does use ham that's kind of an unfair advantage so we might put a little ham in ours just to give us a little leverage right it's a grilled cheese with ham not a ham and cheese get it right we'll talk about that later with all the being said let's make this shall we everyone does grilled cheese a little bit differently we're gonna make a very basic american version so start off with some sliced sandwich bread spread some softened unsalted butter onto one side of that slice make sure the butter gets edge to edge heat your pan to medium and place it in the pan butter side down now add on two slices of your cheese of choice if we want to go traditional american then we're gonna use obviously american cheese usually i prefer my grilled cheese to have more flavor but there is a special nostalgia to using american cheese despite how wrong it feels to my culinary soul now add on another slice of sandwich bread and yes you guessed it but butter the other side of that bread so it's coated edge to edge as well then once the side that's been toasting is a nice golden brown flip and toast the other side here's the key you don't want to toast too fast or too slow you want it for roughly about a minute or slightly longer so you have a nice deep toast with a good crunch and obviously the cheese needs to look like this when you cut into it because hat right there make your slap your knee to the goddang cows come home now that we have that out of the way it's obviously not fair to put a regular grilled cheese against a grilled cheese that also has ham so now they both have ham now let's begin for the american grilled boy representative begin with sandwich bread down one slice of pepper jack cheese two thin slices of ham one slice of american cheese another two thin slices of ham and another slice of american cheese top your sandwich just as before go to the other sides edge to edge lay in a pan and toast for about one minute flip and repeat on the other side until the bread is beautifully golden brown when we slice that bad boy in half what happens angels sing moving on to the clock monsieur pronunciation can we get a check on that nice first off our morning topping start with one tablespoon of 14 grams of unsalted butter in a medium sauce pot set over medium heat once that's melted and blue blend add in 1 tablespoon or 12 grams of all-purpose flour whisk it together and let that cook for about a minute till it begins to reach a light nutty brown then whisk in one cup or 240 milliliters of whole milk let that heat while stirring constantly until begins to thicken cut off the heat and stir in one cup or 80 grams of grated gruyere cheese now once that's completely melted and you have a glossy sauce season in a taste with salt and pepper and an optional touch of fresh grated nutmeg for the bread you're going to want a nice quality country sourdough of some sort of course we have many guides for that but if you have a good local bakery well get your ass on over there and support a local business slice that bad boy into half inch thick slices load the bottom slice up with grated gruyere cheese two slices of jambon de perry by the way this ham is a classic choice for this sandwich i'm not just doing this to sound fancy top with some grated gruyere cheese and finally add your other slice i'm going to spread on more unsalted softened butter just like the other one pop that bad boy into a pan set over medium heat and let that toast for about one to two minutes until you get a deep golden brown crust spread some more softened butter on that breads exposed bare bottom flip and repeat on the other side once you flip it lower your heat just slightly just so that we make sure we melt that cheese without burning your bread anyway once your sandwich is beautifully toasted pop it onto a small sheet tray coat the top with your mornay sauce a light layer of grated mental cheese pop that under your broiler for one to two minutes or until the cheese is melted bubbling and ever so lightly charred that is a crock monster if i've ever seen one oh but one sandwich is so much bigger listen are you trying to tell me that size matters anyway let's taste test these and decide our winner two sandwiches quack monsieur and uh little uh and cheese we added the ham just to make a little bit fair all right but i mean it looks good god oh boy okay american it's not bad either look this is the power of nostalgia i can eat both of these and say these are both good would i pick this one over the other one probably because i want like a little bit more of an experience usually but when i eat the american version i close my eyes and i envision my childhood and i'm frolicking that is the beauty of nostalgia this on the other hand it's like a culinary experience the chewy meatiness of the ham you got that crispy crust on top the creamy mornay falls in you got so many different intense deeply flavored cheeses and then of course this incredible bread so this is a full-on experience but this one back to your childhood it's still good and the fact that it can even be in the same ring as this is something special but you want to know

we're making Greek guidos for a very cheap price of two dollars wow pull your got mang wallets out blow it out get it all lubricated and guess what you too can make guidos with minimal equipment you don't need all the fancy spindles and this and that shirt it's nice to have you can do this with a basic oven some skewers oh but Josh you're gonna use the little baking steel for the pita okay listen Peter you have to put a baking sheet in the oven and let it get hot in the same way you would have baking seal and it would work so with all that being said let's make this shall we okay we got gyros gyros are simple Pita meet satsiki maybe some other fun accoutrement but that's really it what makes it good is giving it to use proper technique I cannot stress this enough and I know I always like to make my own bread and people like oh look at Josh being so cute listen most store-bought Pita is so trash its shape is better suited to be a frisbee than anything else so making it yourself will present thousands of miles worth of a difference and it's super easy two cups are 487 grams of lukewarm water in a container then whisk in one tablespoon or 14 grams of instant yeast followed by one and a half tablespoons or 18 grams of granulated sugar was still dissolved and separately in a large bowl add five cups or 750 grams of bread flour in one tablespoon or 15 grams of fine sea salt mixed together token mine for your yeasty juices into your flour mixture stir by hand to get a Shaggy dough the need for three to four minutes or until you get a smooth end dough cover with plastic wrap and rise at room temp for one hour or in the fridge overnight if you want to make it ahead look at you planning ahead that's a nice little good stuff 30 minutes before baking either using an inverted baking sheet or a baking steel place that into the middle of your oven preheat to 475 Fahrenheit for 30 minutes and then punch your dough downs but at eight pieces around 150 grams each form each piece into a DeWitt ball cover with a damp towel or grease plastic wrap and rest for 15 minutes then just take each ball and roll them into discs around seven to eight inches wide then one at a time open your oven up and carefully slide a disc into your oven using a floured Pizza Peel or a cutting board close and bake for one to two minutes or until it begins to nicely flip it over and cook for one to two more minutes then immediately remove place it Intel to keep it from drying out and repeat with the rest next up papa's big meat oh Josh but cheaper how can make gyro meat without a spindle listen imagine a life where instead of looking for problems you look for Solutions so first you'll need three pounds or 1.3 kilograms of boneless pork Boston butt cut that roughly into half inch slices it does help to freeze this for about an hour before slicing now once all that slice let's make a basic spice mix consisting of one tablespoon or three grams of dried oregano one tablespoon or 9 grams of paprika two teaspoons or six grams of fresh cracked black pepper one tablespoon or 9 grams of kosher salt one tablespoon or three grams of finely chopped Rosemary mix so combined then add five cloves of garlic Theory finely chopped mixed together one more time and stir in two tablespoons or 30 grams of vegetable oil until you get a nice paste rub your meat off with all your seasoning paste then once fully coated get yourself long skewers at least eight to ten inches long optionally you could stab them into an apple or onion then one slice at a time stab and stack your meat onto the skewers stacking all the way up until you have a glorious meat Tower pop that bad boy onto a foil Latin baking sheet ideally with a wire rack set on top if you have one and roast in an oven that's been preheated to 400 Fahrenheit rotating often for about 45 minutes or until cooked to an internal temp of 155 to 160 fahrenheit and beautifully Brown and lightly charred in little spots then remove and let it rest for 15 minutes now this will be sliced thinly and beautifully but only when you're about to serve do not slice the meat and let it sit to dry out like it's in the Mojave Desert in your cave we're not making jerky next we're gonna make our toppings what comes after Papa's big meat Pas medium-sized Bowl start with two cups or 450 grams of full fat Greek yogurt that's full fat half of a seedless English cucumber grated which will then be lightly salted tossed and squeezed of its excess moisture once it's given up a good amount of its liquid you can then add it to your yogurt along with a quarter cup or 15 grams of very finely chopped parsley salt and pepper to taste three cloves of garlic grated and two tablespoons or 18 grams of extra virgin olive oil and you have my big thick Tzatziki moving on have a red onion slices thinly as you can mandolin not mandatory but helpful pop those into a small bowl cover the wire rack and wash and soak for about 30 seconds drain the water and you have raw onion so good while raw you'll be spanking yourself wondering why you ever cooked it for tomatoes you'll just need two Roma tomatoes sliced moderately thin and salted just before serving now albeit optional this is probably my most favorite topping of all time a humble french fry cut two russet potatoes into matchsticks pop into a bowl generously seasoned with salt cover with water and let that soak for 15 minutes drain the water dry the potatoes off with paper towels get yourself a pot filled halfway with vegetable oil so about two quarts heat to 325 Fahrenheit fry your potatoes in batches about one to two minutes or until just barely cooked through remove from the oil and drain then increase the heat to 375 Fahrenheit and yet again in batches fry your potatoes and this time until they get a beautifully crispy golden brown crust around the potato remove from the oil and drain remember always immediately hit generously with salt while it's still hot and fresh but Josh what happens if you let them sit too long well the salt will bounce right off them brothers now the time for assembly has come big boy peted down I mean wow these things are fat and there ain't no problem with that you could totally cut each ball in half when making the dough by the way and get more Pita that's moderately sized add a nice generous pile of your meat which you waited to slice fresh right do you want your kiss from Papa or not fold that up with a generous dollop or two of your Satsuki don't be scared to be generous here stuck on some hot salty french fries your tomato slices which have been salted your red onion and optionally to finish things up you can add some fresh parsley on top a little pop of green now let's taste and see if this is as good for our mouths as it is for our wallets look at this baby Ah that's busting oh my goodness look at that you got the potatoes the tomatoes greens beans tomatoes potatoes four four yo yo something this beautiful for this price bottom is like crispy but the top is Fluffy Jesus I don't know that I would be able to tell any difference between a butt cheaper version and a normal version this is kind of like everything you need and it also shows the beauty and simplicity of Greek cuisine you don't need a lot of money to make a great Greek dish an incredible wrap sandwich whatever you want to call it we're bringing a representative of Greek culture and today Hano step in this is his moment to shine every single day he's told us that he's Greek like we've forgotten we get it okay you agree emotionally preparing myself because I know how good this is going to be oh my goodness I'm not kidding I didn't watch you do the seasoning for the pork in Greece when they make egos they don't do like the lamb and beef that they do in the United States as much it's not as popular they use this pork however you seasoned it tastes exactly like it's from Greece the proportions are a little bit different than you'd get in a restaurant in Greece but the exact same flavor emphasis on putting the fries in the Middle with the Tomato the onions if you hit it on the head the Greek sign off we're better than Italians just kidding Italians are great there's Greeks no food a little bit better as Gordon Ramsay he said it no you phenomenal job all right we got the Greek sign off you heard it here and all for an affordable

new york how would you know that because i got poland spring second you see this you know someone's in new york so we're gonna go down to the local bodega i'm gonna go pick up a nice bacon egg and cheese taste it i've had them before but i need to revise my memory to really make this properly so whipping it up classic style on a roll i did salt pepper ketchup you know not always do people do that but it's a classic nothing wrong with it somehow they have everything you could possibly need in one place all things are possible beautiful and bacon egg and cheese is plentiful and the garbage truck is loud yeah there's something special about this is it dog poop is it drugs or is it alcohol that he's gonna drink in public no no no no this is a bacon egg and cheese when you say the name of this sandwich please be aware that if you're in new york for some reason it's all one word it's bigger i can choose the less syllables the better i would say there it is but i mean come on come on i'll put this in my there are many things of a culture of new york that ties everything together earlier vikram was talking about how he really doesn't want to live in new york fine everybody teach their um i'm not sure if i would either but it's moments like this that do make me want to live in new york it's a little quaintness of it step outside your brownstone or your apartment or whatever wherever you're living right scroll down grab a crappy coffee in one of these and it just feels right got all these beautiful buildings history but this bacon egg and cheese for some reason ties it all together for me i hate when i get a breakfast sandwich that doesn't have enough bacon you know what i'm talking about every breakfast sandwich from every fast food chain get a little paper thin razor thin piece of bake i don't even know how they slice it that then this is chock full of it wide open in your mouth it's a classic i don't think this is about making it better but i do think that it's about elevating all of the elements that we love the most about this sandwich and making what i think might be the most iconic bacon egg and cheese if not close to it okay so we're back in the kitchen from new york you already heard my key takeaways but i have all the flavors in my mind in my mouth now so i'm going to spit all that back up onto a plate with all that being said let's make this shall we right as i've said this isn't just about a bacon and cheese breakfast sandwich it's the culture and the little tricks and things that create something much more special this is a bacon egg and cheese now one of those classic elements is a soft kaiser roll sure you could go buy one and i can tell you right now the logo bodega is definitely not making theirs people are gonna complain oh he bought him what the so guess what i'm making it so stained mixer bowl add 450 grams of all-purpose flour yes i'm using grams on a new york bodega sandwich why because i want consistency in your bread game and if you don't want to use grams link at the bottom of the description for the full recipe anyway in your flour 3 grams of food grade amylase powder 9 grams of fine sea salt and 8 grams of sugar mix until combined separately you'll need 170 grams of water at around 95 degrees fahrenheit whisk in 8 grams of instant yeast until dissolved followed by one large egg and with your stand mixer fitted with lesbian begin mixing at medium low and add your yeasty eggs let that mix until you get a rough dough then add in 28 grams of unsalted softened butter keyword is softened here pal all right don't make any mistake you wakeys mix completely until incorporated then continue to knead for two to three minutes or until you get a smooth supple dough puff that into a grease bowl and rise for one hour or till doubled punch that brother down cut into six even pieces around 130 grams each roll into toit balls did you know that many things start with balls i don't know if that's true now place those balls on a parchment-lined baking sheet and once you have all your balls evenly spaced apart optionally but ideally use a kaiser press link in the description for the one that i use and press that until almost to the point of touching the baking sheet but not all the way through the dough repeat with all your balls spray their tops and non-stick spray flip them over and cover with greased plastic wrap to proof for 25 minutes at room temperature this is a good time to preheat your oven to 375 fahrenheit if you're thinking ahead and once they're done resting gently flip them all back over brush each bun lightly with whole milk then sprinkle all them with poppy seeds and then pop into your preheated oven for 15 to 18 minutes or until a beautiful golden brown kaiser roll emerges let those cool completely on a wire rack and i'll tell you what brother you're about three quarters of the way to a beautiful sandwich let's start our sandal off with mr traditional a classic bacon and cheese with salt pep and ketchup this is one of the only ways you'll see me doing something as sinister as putting ketchup on my eggs first obviously slice your rolls in half lightly toast them for each sandwich you'll need two whole eggs cracked and whisked so eight total if you're making four sandwiches so i guess we'll work off the idea that we're making for sandwiches seasoned taste of salt which again it's okay to season them ahead with salt as long as you're cooking them hard which we will here whisk until homogeneous now you'll need one pound of applewood smoked bacon cooked however you like it the easiest way to pop it on a baking sheet and into a 400 degree oven for about 10 to 15 minutes or until cooked to your liking look i know there's the debate of oh do we go crispy do we go floppy listen this is not the time for flaccid bacon all right i'm all for a moist bacon but i want this crunchy okay part of the texture drain lightly on a paper towel to soak up the excess greasiness and then get a 10 inch non-stick pan heat over medium heat add about a tablespoon of unsalted butter or just enough to coat the pan and once that's melted and bubbling pour in about two whole eggs worth of your beaten eggs and as that cooks bringing the sides to the center of the pan letting the uncooked egg fill up the now empty space in the pan repeat all the way around and once that egg is nearly fully set add one to two slices of american cheese to the center feel free to give it a little bit of pep then fold one side of the egg towards the center then the bottom of the egg also towards the center the other side of the egg towards the center see where we're going here and finally the top down to enclose a little parcel of egg sign it yours truly make sure the got dang address is correct for once and send that off to your nearest goddang bun top it with your cooked bacon and then on the other bun hit with ketchup pepper and salt to taste top that messy thing and this is the most important part in foil parchment or ideally a sandwich wrapper wrap that thing as tightly so that this is essentially steaming the bread to get that traditional texture you'll expect from a good old bacon egg cheese now cut it in half good lord it's a goddamn cross section i'm gonna need to go take lap it's doing something to me and of course don't forget the bev or have hellfire from all new yorkers ring down upon your sins now let's taste test mr original let's pop him out and look at this cross section i mean god that is just good you can really taste why this is so special to so many people the saltiness cheese is melty and ooey gooey the bun is so soft from like steaming inside of this that's the key crunchy bacon and then of course a little bit of balancing on that richness with some ketchup normally i would never put ketchup on breakfast sandwich that is just good all right that's out of the way let's try another one that you guys on my instagram dms just kept suggesting it's literally the exact same thing kaiser roll toasted eggs cheese fold egg down bacon down but this time instead of ketchup you're gonna take a little bit of grape jelly and spread it on both cut sides of your toasted bread for some unexplainable reason you know i thought i was getting pranked when i saw this request so many times but you know what i decided let's try it but uh not so sure about it though now speaking of never putting stuff on a breakfast sandwich grape jelly really weird kind of annoying to be honest a lot of people asked for it in my research it was pretty prevalent if i smoked a lot of weed i would think this is good that's who orders this part of me wants to like it and part of me is like i don't know about this i will say this it provides the same level of sweetness that the ketchup does i can see how it could be used the same way i don't know that i would order it again like that but it wasn't bad it does cut the richness but it's the fruitiness that's a little out of the way for me so i guess it depends on the jam that they use or the jelly not bad not my first choice this is a personalized sandwich okay relax last but not least is the deep pockets bacon egg and cheese that you'll almost definitely never see in but we're gonna do it anyway butter in the pan heat over medium heat melt the bubbling add your eggs attach your fresh sliced chives let that cook while that's going cut a quasam in half place on a heated griddle iron top with a slice of amantal cheese and this time fold your egg into more of a rectangular shape no cheese needed on the inside of this one pop that hot boy onto your cheese quassle follow with your nicest most expensive bacon hit it with some hot sauce to taste another layer of emintol the top of your quasom and press and what happens after that well it got a little more flat than intended i'll be honest with you there's something here i'm sure there's something here this is sort of like i guess uh the cubano of croissants maybe that's kind of cool let's just taste test it anyway last one my flattest concoction on the show in history which is kind of fun it's almost like a little finger food did somebody say oh bonjour every new yorker watching this is like what is that i get it i don't know honestly it's kind of good kendrick do you want to try this pano all right vikram you're trying the fancy one so here's a fancy fork oh he wanted me to feed him i should have fed him despite how flat it is it's actually pretty good there's something fine dining for this i didn't use some restaurant i just like played it like this standing straight up a little little quinel of sauce next to it boom thirteen dollars thank you it's very good the shape is off-putting but the taste is very yeah it looked like a flat turtle it looked like if a turtle got ran over by a car i've seen her turtle ran over by a car it's ugly i'm gonna go cry now i didn't run over it this is not a bacon egg and cheese this is the bacon egg and cheese and now you know how to harness its power do you wanna know what else is power you can harness b-roll [Music] you

much guilt for trash we'll do better [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so today we're making the pizza hut cinnamon sticks this could also be i guess an implication to make the dominoes ones too how pizza's the hut and domino out uh board game the domino so if you don't have a pizza hut near you and you don't know what this is it's essentially cinnamon roll in the form of a stick and they just use leftover pizza dough make them margins real good the thing is like any bread with sugar in their case fake butter is probably gonna be okay-ish as a human being you see bread and you're like i have nothing else i want to add to that so with all that being said let's make this shall we pizza hut the lesser delivery option hey this is just someone just farting in and over and over uh can i just get two orders of the cinnamon sticks god that was awful every every ounce of that i hate it every second i need to go lay down it'll be here we didn't physically go to a building so the three-point test is just a zero across the board i guess i'll give a five out of ten for the customer service because she was nice but also like i could hardly hear her we got the bad branding the same since like 1832 which i kind of respect so these are hot which is nice total came out to 22-17 this looks like the sweaty guy at the community pool who shaved like a week ago and it's starting to grow back and he's like kind of just started working out his stomach area ready tell me i'm raw is this cooked so moist icing why is it yellow it doesn't smell bad it actually smells good i don't know if it's real cinnamon though that don't look right this doesn't taste like icing it tastes like sweetened condensed milk mixed with glue i do like this crispy bottom that's nice smells good call me crazy this is kind of good but it's sweet enough as it is it doesn't really need the icing what i don't like is whatever this fake butter is on here it's got like a margarine aftertaste not a fan coating the mouth grotesque but i like the crunch in the bottom i like the sweetness on the top there's elements to this that i enjoy and then there's a visceral amount of elements that just shouldn't exist ruin you do not need this this on its own is fine but they had an opportunity to make a real experience here i think we'll take that job roido this is one of my favorite breads we've ever done on this channel that's really saying something because we've done a lot of breads something about one of these thick fat logs crispy bottomed cinnamon and brown butter laid in so righteous so naughty and borderline perfect the way they are let's begin the ever so secret dough well hypothetically they would be using leftover pizza dough but it's also pizza hut good for their margins that's for sure now we're gonna mimic the same idea with a sort of a neapolitan style pizza dough quite literally no fat in the dough whatsoever now please do all this in grams i'm not giving you an alternative so sorry but it needs to be done this way for consistency's sake love you so much in a large bowl add 800 grams of double o tipo flour and 16 grams of fine sea salt mixed together till combined separately you'll need 512 grams of water around 95 fahrenheit was get 8 grams of instant yeast and look at this we doubled what's traditional for the yeast here in a proper neapolitan dough and we did it for that now add the yeasty wawa to your flour mixture mix by hand until you get a rough dough yes it will be sticky don't come whining in the comments oh my gosh what do i do with my handy it's supposed to be so to knead it hold your hand in a scoop shape pick the dough up and slap it against the bowl like this within a few minutes of that it should start to pull from the side of the bowl and smooth out and at that point you can knead it as normal in the bowl until you get a taut smooth dough about three to four minutes total depending on the biceps of yours we'll do a light bowl place in a greased large bowl cover with plastic wrap and look yes you can rise at room temp for one to two hours till double blah blah blah but if you want that ooey gooey yeasty goodness pop it in the fridge to rise overnight listen if you're gonna wait to see the new marvel movie then you're gonna wait for some good ass cinnamon sticks anyway once the dough is thicker than me and skin tight jeans punch the dough down dump out onto a lightly floured work surface and divide into 16 evenly sized pieces around 70 to 80 grams each depending on how large you want these roll them into light balls cover the damn towel and rest for 10 minutes once rested roll each of them into three point five inch surges place those in eight by eight or nine by nine trays which will fit two rows of five or two rows of four repeat with another eight by eight tray and you might be thinking in this ten wait a minute josh the this one isn't filled out properly yeah that's because i might have gotten a little cocky and didn't measure each piece out don't do that anyway cover the plastic wrap and proof for 30 minutes at room temp and when you start that proof i'd recommend preheating your oven to 425 fahrenheit the month is big time get yourself a quarter cup or 62 grams of melted clarified butter also known as ghee do not use regular batar you can make your own clarified butter yourself or you can buy it from the store now brush half your multi-clarified butter on one sheet of sticks and then the other half on the other sheet of sticks yes use all of it i want this thing sinking into the tight moist crevices of your thick sticks make it naughty now pop those into your preheated oven and bake for 18 to 20 minutes and while that's baking we prepare everything else first off cinnamon sugar basic small bowl three quarters of a cup 167 grams of granulated sugar 1.5 tablespoons or 5 grams of ground cinnamon and optionally a generous pinch of fresh grated nutmeg whisk until thoroughly combined and just like all my other recipes that have cinnamon sugar this makes more than you need for the recipe i will say nothing else other than you're welcome now obviously their cinnamon sticks are brushed with butter boring what if we made brown butter still boring what is this 2012 what if we smoked the butt er now i can feel my culinary ego coursing through my veins in a medium sized pot add half a cup or 112 grams of salted not unsalted this is what makes this butter fun set that over medium heat and let that melt and cook swirling the pan often and you'll start to notice those milk solids in the bottom starting to toast looks a little darker a little darker and you're gonna let that keep going until it reaches a relatively deep brown color not quite mahogany but close to it now pour that out into a bowl set over an ice bath and continuously stir just until it's fully chilled and into more of a softened butter state get yourself a large heap roof container something like a full or even a half hotel pan works you could also use a large deep baking pan place your bowl of butter in there form sort of a three inch wide bowl shape that a foil something i'm sure some of you juvenile delinquents may find familiar shame on you now if you want to smoke this the easiest way is with this special compressed wood which is super easy to get and there's a link in the description to find the one that i use now get a couple half inch chunks of it place in your foil bowl blast that with a kitchen torch until fully charred and beginning to smoke lightly blow on it trap with the lid and allow to smoke for 15 minutes remove the lid and optionally you can repeat that one more time if you want it super smoky and that's it now before you say anything this hilariously does not make my smoke alarm go off i don't know why opening the oven while literally cooking yeah yeah alarm time is so fun haha literally smoking something indoors but let's look at this butter ah huh pretty good french homies what do we think now at this point your timer should be ding-a-linging or close to it if not while you're probably about to be filled with regret now after that 18-20 minute big time out should emerge a very lightly golden brown bun ever so lightly blistered on the crust nearly focaccia-like with that neapolitan-style dill working its magic now immediately brush each pan with your smoked brown butter follow that with a generous sprinkle of your cinnamon sugar on top each individual bun don't be shy here go hard on both the butter and the sugar yes you will use all the butter you won't use all the sugar see the sugar's gonna melt with the butter and dissolve and look so beautiful this reminds me those little cinnamon sugar toasts that my mom would make me when i was a kid you know what i'm talking about now immediately pull those from their pan and cool slightly on a wire rack very important because you want to preserve that bottom now all that cool speaker cream cheese icing medium sized bowl eight ounces or 227 grams of full fat cream cheese half a cup or 112 grams of salted butter softened beat those two together with a handheld electric mixer and once homogenous add two and three quarters of a cup or 373 grams of powdered sugar in batches until all of it's incorporated and you have a smooth frosting like consistency finally add one and a half teaspoons or nine grams of vanilla bean paste or you can use fresh vanilla bean if you like then add whole milk to thin about two teaspoons at a time beating it in before adding more until it reaches a drizzleable consistency you don't want it too thick and you don't want it too thin you should be able to dip this without it being water while simultaneously not taking the whole damn ramekin with it too when you pull your stick out of it boy that did not read the same way when i say it out loud now all there is to do is pop your bad boy onto a tray or a serving platter with a nice ramekin of your icing optionally you can drizzle these bad boys with some extra icing as well doesn't do much flavor-wise but it does give a little extra visual excitement too now let's put this in our mouths wow look at that two of them are gone because i fed them to the team pono unhinged his jaw like an anaconda first off listen it's okay it's okay it's okay because you can hear it from where you're standing give this a dunk oopsie this is like a two-year-old playing basketball against lebron james i guess i'll describe the flavor although it doesn't matter just make it the texture of this dough is like a luscious cloud mattress that you fall into and you're just endlessly falling into comfort and joy and happiness so the butter don't skip a single technique the smokiness the brown butter it's like every flavor working together into a beautiful harmony so we won but we need to taste tess kendrick's coming in today yeah [Music] you can't keep getting away with it number two i'm ready for disappointment that does taste like glue number one or two you didn't tell me i'll be honest mine are a lot thicker wider longer girthier the difference is immeasurable starting off with the bread bread's so much softer fluffier it's got a bit of sweetness to it that really enhances the butter cinnamon everything just kind of melds together this is hospital food i wouldn't give this to my worst enemy which one did you give me this was one that was no uh which one of these did you give me oh this one that was like probably one of the greatest compliments i've ever received jesus b-roll

time when all you wanted was a little taco now it's steamed in a box disgusting flavorless not today we're done with that fan favorite ulysses call in the restaurant gonna go and get it come back i gotta make it before he gets back let's begin thank you today we're going to win the first flat shirt didn't work so it's a reverse ulysses and i'm a little bit more meaningless recipe on the website i gotta pee this could be a little bit mixed up but we'll start with the beef taco start with breakfast taco onion diced onion in the bowl all right tomato cut that like this baton's icing it all the way home dicing the jalapenos i mean pinot he said who said that and that's the story i've just been chilling right now am i getting too cocky yeah okay chopped cilantro in a little bit of salt peppy whippy and a wee bit of lime juice okay mix that up pico de gallo look at that that's done i'm doing a rager this week because we win it straight win let's make the salsa this is for the steak taco this is not an order in any sense of the words so don't be like oh well which parts what look i'm doing this for speed not for your aesthetic wonder top on just take the tops off of these serranos two of those in the blender tomatillos normally i char them but do i look like i have time a little bit of lime juice i got an onion that i'm gonna cut the bottom and the top off and then in half skin it in there i was messing with josh's equipment so some of the electricity might not be running through gotta be like the strobes and cheat to win baby oh boy that's done salsa can be simple it should be simple i would argue that's a finished salsa i told josh a long time ago he was invited to the carne asada but if he wins he's disinvited so onion cut the top off this is for the top you know how it is you go to taco truck they got the onions and the cilantro you can't knock that that's like probably one of the most iconic combos that just works so beautifully i'm gonna dice that all right that goes in the bowl where are they i wonder where they're at right now you know if the united states government would just let me use my speed powers without any consequences series would have been over episode one we got some cilantro this is also for our garnish very rough chiffonade if you want to finely chop cilantro quickly don't just run your knife through it okay start with a nice little rough chiffonade it doesn't have to be perfect down the whole line and then we went this way now we're gonna go this way very finely and boom you gotta find chopped cilantro you can make a few more pass throughs and it's i shouldn't have chose two tacos what do you think about josh's speed story time the dudes are like yo let's go get some coffee in my fast need for speed cool i'm down to going to spaceship i'm all about going fast man this dude is not fast outside the kitchen car so slow i thought he was running out of gas one pin for the tacos one for the eggs one for the steak boom a little bit of butter just like that sausage will go about that length half our eggs one two i don't know why i chose to make two tacos just making it significantly more difficult but in what scenario are you making a breakfast taco and a steak taco right this should make a good point for those of you at home who are cooking and oh you don't want to take the time this and that look if i can cook these two in time you can at least cook one at least sausage in so i'm using this pan for two different things sausage on one side egg on the other it's the way to go because we don't have a ton of time this needs to be in there like yesterday using that generously with salt and pepper that could have been a little hotter i'll be honest using the other side heavy heavy heavy salt this is a thick steak guys you got to go heavy on the salt sausages are looking good steak is searing i feel great about that a little peppy on the steak we're in a good spot i feel good i feel good traffic where's everyone going i don't know everyone should be at work lunch is over quit your job i don't even know what's what here all right while i'm waiting for that i'm gonna get the rest of our accoutrement prepared we got our avocado or this skillet a little easier we're going to slice it nicely you got to get a good crusty on your steak otherwise what's the point am i right i might have to pop that in the oven because it's so thick rooney sausages are getting crisp all right now we're ready for our egg egg in keep that away from the sausages with a wee bit of salt pull that in stirring it's all right heat off this is actually done so i'm putting this over here this is gonna get flipped boom look at that look at that crust we got a crusty in the house hold up baby this is a series right now we're only five but we come back got the bag now let's go get this dough they've left the restaurant all right we got a garlic and oregano in here and butter and a cinnamon stick gonna baste it that doesn't go in the trash look at this we got some base action over here smells good it looks good it feels good i'll tell you right now the restaurant's not doing this what do you think you're at the french bistro all right that's basted i'm gonna finish that over here it's gonna be pretty rare but you know what that doesn't matter that's fine it'll still be good it's a good quality beef and that's really what's important i don't know what i have left there's so many ingredients in these two together the recipe's gonna be on the website all organized for you wow look at that you like that plug we winning this are we winning this is josh wiseman a cook does he have a book yeah stupid um i don't know what this lime juice is for steak in the oven we're heating we're heating we're heating let's get two plates this one in this one nice okay tortillas are getting hot feel good guys the corn tortillas are done char they're nice and pliable flour tortilla done i don't even want to talk to you right now frustrated i'm in traffic this is what we're thinking why are you still talking to me let's start with the breakfast ones it's a little bit simpler so tortilla right here flour we got our egg going on nicely sausage smoked we gotta go right on top tomatoes onions cilantro so many powerful flavors a little bit of lime juice and then a wee bit of cheese we got four minutes baby that's just enough time this is the worst one tacos are easy but making two different ones bad idea do this nice tender bit here steak's a bit thick oh it's not too bad that's good cut this nice and thin oh that looks great right on top boom avocado sweet onion cilantro and uh we're done here's the salsa bite it dip it don't just throw the sauce on there post game comments uh this was terrible in terms of speed if you want to move quickly don't make two tacos and now we'll wait for them to show up winner winner taco dinner you're not invited to the carne asada anymore and i'm telling my grandma don't you tell your grandma where's the sportsmanship in this company said that we won be live you sick i'm tired you always win i know you're serious sausage that does look good but it also looks like a diaper totally different type of taco though this is like ground sausage they just kind of mix in with the egg this is all thrown together to be as fast as possible it's like a steak fajita taco god that was assembled badly this isn't about better it looks decent it does look decent we'll do their beef beef is super dry but it tastes good now mine a little bit of the salsa it's like sort of a very balanced taco i feel like this one is kind of unbalanced in that regard i like the breakfast one that's right not mine about the same in terms of goodness totally different experience whole sausage more like jimmy dean you pick this is a little more exciting although this isn't a but better it's not necessarily better but you can diversify this however you want unlimited possibilities so i count that as a dub but we have to have a taste tester we're bringing on just one today we don't want everyone suckling on one taco that's gross so number one choo choo two one do you chew that at all i don't like the way you eat pink oh my goodness we do one thing we made two different tacos equally if not better than the other one that is a proper taco faster you

Additional Cookbook...",2022-11-30 21:59:44.385768, the age of the five dollar foot long is dead but we're gonna resuscitate it paddle shock it back to life for this price that is but cheaper [Music] so the footlong we all love it right it's a foot long sandwich i don't think a foot long is really that common outside of america consumption of excess but don't get me wrong i love a good foot long sub sandwich i mean that's special you know the rules of footlong is kind of just its length and it's got to be a sub sandwich anything on the inside goes so you can't stop me from putting a little roasty chicky in there now can you the best part of this sandwich is you can do this with just about any piece of equipment making the bread all you need is an oven and a baking sheet it's not that hard you can make it without the stand mixer so with all that being said let's make this shall we we're bringing back the cheap foot long with homemade bread deli meat and a classy list of veggie toppings let's make this simple first off bread one cup or 250 grams of milk around 95 fahrenheit whisk in two and a half tablespoons or 30 grams of granulated sugar two and a half teaspoons or eleven grams of instant yeast was till dissolved separately in a stand mixer stand mixer expensive josh what me do don't you worry sweetheart replace the butter in this recipe with vegetable oil and add with the milkies right here and that's really it that's the only difference now if you have a stand mixer add to the bowl three cups or 450 grams of all-purpose flour and one teaspoon or three grams of fine sea salt mix that thoroughly pop on the spiral thing start on medium low add your mommy milkies along with two whole eggs beaten let that mix for 2-3 minutes or until you get a nice dough add in a quarter cup of 56 grams of unsalted butter that's fully softened to room temp and let that mix for five more minutes or until incorporated and your dough is smooth and stretchy cover with plastic wrap and rise one hour at room temp and up to overnight in the fridge now punch your dough down divide into six evenly sized pieces around 140 grams each roll those into light balls rest for 15 minutes cover with a moist towel then roll them out into you guessed it buddy foot long logs taper the edges lightly place on a parchment-lined baking sheet which i'd recommend doing three to a sheet to allow for expansion cover that and proof for 30 minutes then brush with egg wash consisting of one egg plus a teaspoon of water beaten together and optionally you can top each piece with sesame seeds and grated cheese if you have any but look really it's not necessary it's more of an aesthetic and a minutiae flavor thing optionally scored them down the middle but a quarter inch deep pop those into another that's been preheated to 375 fahrenheit for 17 to 20 minutes or until you get a beautifully golden brown rod now deli meat there's many ways to do this first in a small bowl add one teaspoon or half a gram of finely chopped fresh rosemary two teaspoons or seven grams of garlic powder one teaspoon or two grams of brown sugar and one and a half tablespoons or eight grams of kosher salt whisk until mine and that's your cheeky now wrastle yourself three bone in skin on chicken breasts about 2 pounds or 900 grams hit those with your chicken seasoning and then at this point you can choose from many cooking methods the best way is to cook them via sous-vide but the second best way is to quite literally just roast them pop them onto a wire rack or baking sheet cover with foil and into an oven preheated to 425 fahrenheit and roast them for around 25 minutes or just until the internal temp reaches 165 fahrenheit then just chill your breasts completely in the fridge and if you don't want to wait hours for that you can pop it in a baggie and into an ice water bath for just a few minutes sure it's not cured but when you slice it really thin and beautifully like this well then that's quite literally cold cut chicken and many times this is how it's done in the gat dang deli that's it for the cooking the rest is all assembly technique now first off slice tomato slice it as thick or as thin as you like but please dear god season them with salt optionally some pepper too now red onion slice that bad boy as thinly as you can ideally on a death trap mandolin if you have one then once sliced cover with a wire rack and rinse under cold water for about 30 seconds drain that water and you have the greatest sandwich onions of your life iceberg up ahead thinly slice it the thinner the lettuce the bigger the kiss from papa pop that lettuce into a medium sized bowl and add two tablespoons or nine grams of olive oil optionally a pinch of dried oregano 4 tablespoons or 24 grams of red wine vinegar and a small pitch of salt and pepper to taste toss that all together and you have basically a dressed salad topping now slice a foot long boy in half generously mail your bottom side and i can't stress this enough if you don't like mayo then respectfully please go sit in timeout for 35 minutes but if you do please do it right and go hard on the mail put more than you usually do follow that with two slices of provolone torn in half and shingled across to cook the whole bottom half follow that with a fat generous stack of your thinly sliced chicky your perfect sliced red onion the dressed iceberg lettuce oh and uh don't forget to mail your top half as well generously and finally your beautifully seasoned tomatoes what else do we do with a prince so perfect we crown that  and by golly that might just be a king that we happen to be looking at and for a price anyone would be happy to pay for papa's foot long now let's taste test ah it smells like a cold cut sandwich shop up in here yes a little more or less i like the lettuce wee bit wow it's been a while since i've had a legit cold cut sandwich so maybe it's the delirious aspect of that distance of time or this is the best god damn cold-cut sandwiches i've had in a while and it's a foot long so the beauty of this sandwich is that a cold-cut piece of meat is literally just pre-cooked meat that's been cured and chilled but sometimes not even cured you could be saving so much money this sandwich for this price it's an incredible experience the tomatoes the lettuce the acidity the saltiness a little bit of sweetness from the tomato this is like an ideal foot long sandwich and by golly i want to put it in my mouth but you want to know what else i want to put in my mouth b-roll [Music] you

Japanese Dumplings,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VZY52bYTm64/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLCQPuagg-s-O6eHUfK8P0d5fg_ZEg,VZY52bYTm64,"8 minutes, 1 second","Dumplings deserve the highest form of respect, which is why I’m putting my two favorites against each other. Only one dumpling may be victorious. 

Gyoza Wrappers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v...",2022-11-30 21:59:44.385768, this is the dumpling off of the century so we're gonna take the two most popular and bring them head to head [Music] today we're doing chinese style dumplings versus japanese style dumplings from what i've researched chinese dumplings have a much wider bread you know you've got soup dumplings steamed dumplings there are also fried dumplings so i figured let's choose an iconic one like chumai make them go with the number one choice that you see often which is gyoza they've got some similarities but they also have some major differences we're gonna put them together you're gonna have a little kiss my clean fight but then and we'll find out well which one i like but more specifically if there's a winner so with all that being said let's make this shall we right let's not waste time first we start with gyoza guess what you'll need gyoza rappers look i'm not going to judge you go buy them make them yourself it's up to you i have a recipe for the wrappers look at the description for that you like the little plug all right first off pork if you want gyoza not only with maximum flavor but with the most undeniably juicy luscious filling it'll have your knees shaking and wobbling at the mirror squirt then you'll grind it fresh yourself anyway start with three quarters of a pound or 340 grams of ground pork in ideally a bowl to that you'll add two finely chopped green cabbage leaves but wait don't be nasty and throw it in there raw otherwise it'll leach out too much liquid and it's gonna make a sloppy little dumpling so instead after you finally chop your cabbage hit it with a touch of salt toss together and squeeze aggressively to release as much water from the cabbage as possible strain out the water and then add it to your big juicy bowl of meat follow that with three finely chopped green onion one teaspoon or three grams of toasted sesame oil two teaspoons or eight grams of mirin one tablespoon or 14 grams of soy sauce three quarters of a teaspoon or five grams of fine sea salt two cloves of grated garlic and a two inch knob of ginger peeled and also grated lovingly mixed together by hand you know really get in there put in some elbow grease getting sick of this lazy ass meat mixing i keep seeing on instagram it's sickening i know you know how to smash so please really emulsify this right next up our pork chumai filling very similar but also literally not if you take a closer look start with four dried shiitake mushrooms cover those with boiling water and let it sit and rehydrate for five to eight minutes or until very soft bring out the water from that little taki what and then yet again three quarters of a pound or 340 grams of ground pork the fattier the better so it's not a lump of coal wrapped in dumpling dough into a bowl and add a quarter cup or 40 grams of finely chopped water chestnuts two finely chopped green onion two teaspoons or 10 grams of shaoxing wine one teaspoon or five grams of soy sauce two teaspoons or eight grams of granulated sugar one teaspoon or six grams of fine sea salt half a teaspoon or half a gram of ground white pepper and one inch knob of ginger grated mix and homogenize the beautifully meaty masterpiece finally cut half a pound or 227 grams of raw peeled and deveined shrimp into third inch pieces pop that into your meat gently fold together to avoid mashing the shrimp up too much chop your rehydrated mushrooms finely and fold those in as well the tail of two dumpy fillings and while they both share similarities they also look quite different in texture to me the steaks raise yet again okay shaping time both extremely different for the gyoza wet the edges with water lightly you'll place around a one and a half teaspoon dollop of meat on a dumpling wrapper fold like a taco adhere at the top center of that taco and then you'll pleat both open ends three to four times all the way to the edges first on one side and then on the other clip to make sure it's closed make sure the bottom is flat you can make it straight or you can curve it it's up to you make sure everything is fully enclosed with no air bubbles bing bang bop and you made a dumpling please listen to me here though you're gonna have to shape a bunch of these by hand so get a helper but more specifically relax your shoulders loosen your jaw unclench your cheeks ah isn't that nice and just make dumpling cool then repeat with all of your dumplings now onto shumai first you'll need a different kind of wrapper you can add an egg and slightly reduce the water in my gyoza wrapper or you can buy an shoe my wrapper now make a hole with your index finger and thumb nice whole starting with half a teaspoon at a time using an unsharpened butter knife or mini offset spatula smear your meat mixture in the center allowing to push through that hole to start making sort of a little sack now once you have the maximum amount of meat in the chumai flatten the top out flatten the bottom and wet and fold any ears that are sticking up so it's nice and flat on the sides and that's ashumai ironically i actually find this one harder than the last but again breathe in breathe out make dumpling stop thinking about taxes stop thinking about the economy stop thinking about that scary movie and that there might be something behind you right now just make it dumpling and repeat with the rest right cooking method for the japanese gyoza first lightly oil a 12-inch non-stick pan with vegetable oil around 2 tablespoons heat over medium and once add in your shaped dumplings flat side down leaving at least a quarter inch of space in between each dumpy and just letting the whole pan like see what i'm saying see what i'm doing around here all the way towards the center now let those cook and brown for about two minutes or until the underside reaches a nice golden brown color like this from there you'll add a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of water immediately cover with the lid reduce the heat to medium low and steam for about seven to eight minutes now while that's cooking you can make your sauce which is quite literally just three tablespoons or 33 grams of soy sauce three tablespoons or 33 grams of rice vinegar and half a teaspoon or half a gram of toasted sesame oil with still combined and your sauce is done now once your gyoza are done remove the lid and if there's any water let it simmer until completely gone the gyoza skin should be a little bit transparent and you guessed it that got bang thing better be cooked on the inside won't make no goddang medium rare dumplings cut off the heat and carefully remove from the pan and place the crusty side up to keep that good old crisp bottom serve hot with your sauce pork shrumai are even easier get a traditional bamboo steamer basket set over a pot with shallow simmering water in it line the steamer with cabbage leaves place as many shumai in there as you can fit optionally add a little pinch of very finely diced carrots or flying fish roe ideally you want around a third cup or one carrot worth cover with its lid and steam for 8 to 10 minutes or until the filling is cooked all the way through around 160 degrees fahrenheit now while that's cooking shumai sauce is literally just going to be 2 tablespoons or 24 grams of chili oil solids or spicy chili crisp and 2 tablespoons or 24 grams of chinese black vinegar whisk together and you got a sauce that you'll surely call mommy now once that's done remove your lid and your shumai serve with the sauce and we have two incredible dumplings both born in different homes but yet they share a home in our hearts now let's taste test and see if there's a winner we got two dumper rooneys right here yoza pan-fried crispy bottom steamy top oily nice lovely and shumai if you've never had chumai is basically a really full dumpling we'll start with the shumai i'm liking it now gyoza the secret you bite a little hole you dip but then you kind of scoop and then you eat the whole thing okay we got the crunch on the bottom salty sweet acidic just like this intense garlicky green onion flavor it's very straightforward the texture's super meaty but fatty at the same time there's distinct differences between these two though if i were to pick i would pick the japanese gyoza over the shumai because i feel like it hits more of the little elements that you want a little crunchy a little chewy little soft and to me the flavor is a little more straightforward the shumai is much more complex so if you're looking for complexity shumai is the answer but in my book i'm going with gyoza more often than not but one isn't necessarily better than the other but do you know what is always better b-roll [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] wow [Music] you

no what in the same hill are you doing well we did this uh not too long ago at an event a couple dozen people came out to eat this one burger and look this isn't the exact same recipe so before you're like aha again you don't for one we added an element he changed a couple sauces and i think made it a little easier for the at home cooks so with all that being said let's make this shall we ah combining two of my favorite foods my luscious berea which is slightly altered for this recipe don't worry papa will show you and the most beautiful cheeseburger now since this beer is different i'll run you through it real quick this time starting off with five pounds or 2.2 kilos of bone in beef short ribs oh look brother i want them bones for the flavor don't try and think you're being smart by getting boneless remember silly geese get roasted and eaten anyway get a nice heavy bottom stock pot that's at least seven quarts add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan heat to medium high just till the oil begins to smoke add in your beef to avoid overcrowding season lightly with salt and pepper and sear for 2-3 minutes per side until you get some nice beautiful color now you're going to season that meat again so go light with the salt finish the rest of your beef set it all to the side and you should still have a nice layer of fat at the bottom of the pot but if not then just go ahead and throw everything away and you're done kidding add a touch more oil if needed reduce the heat to medium and add 2 tablespoons or 30 grams of tomato paste stir and cook for 30 seconds or until it begins to caramelize now add two whole heads of garlic cut in half let you know leave everything there you know totally cool along with one yellow onion cut into quarters but leaving the root and skin attached add those bad boys to your pot follow that with two and a half quarts or 2.4 liters of your absolute nicest beef stock possible now increase the heat to medium bring to a light boil then reduce the heat to low for a nice little simmer so perfect for skinny dipping add all of your beef back let's slide it in there nicely and don't act like this is the first time you had to squeeze your meat into something alright now add one tablespoon or five grams of coriander seeds one tablespoon or nine grams of black peppercorns all whole pause if you do not want spices floating around wrap it in a bouquet garni papa was out of cheesecloth whoopsie-doopsy but this demonstrates the cooking can sometimes be a little bit more relaxed and still delicious thank you and good evening five bay leaves five seeded guajillo chilies five seeded ancho chilies and two seeded chili de arbol which are hiding somewhere in there don't stir at this point instead let it simmer cover with a lid or cartouche and cook for three to three and a half hours cut off the heat gently transfer the softened chilies into a blender along with three cups of the braising liquid button on high until as smooth as possible pour that back into your pot simmer for 10 more minutes then carefully remove your meat and all the bones you know the bones have done their job so you can totally toss those and look at my meat it practically falls apart in my hand it shreds itself at the mere sight of my thumb spiraling towards it and let me tell you something this is moist no other word can describe it pure joyous moistness shred all your beef seasoning the taste with salt season your now consummate with salt to taste and please go heavy there and it's on to the burger first i essentially want a quesadilla tostada in there so get yourself some fry oil to 350 fahrenheit drop in one to three whole corn tortillas at a time and fry for two to three minutes or until the bubbling has mostly subsided and the corn tortilla is nice and stiff straight on a wire rack and season immediately with salt to taste and that is a basic but lovely tostada you'll need two whole tostadas per burger now cilantro emulsion mayo sounds fancy very easy in a blender add in 1 cup of 26 grams of cilantro with the stems attached 8 cups of peeled garlic a quarter cup or 60 grams of lime juice blend that working your way up to high and add in just a tiny splash of water to loosen you really want this to be as smooth but also as thick as possible once it's vortexing stream and a quarter cup of 52 grams of vegetable oil and you have a nice emulsion i'll be honest i added a little too much water to this so it's a little loose don't do that mix that with one and a quarter cup or 275 grams of mayonnaise season a taste with salt and that's your meal for your little juicy burger now it's assembly time start off with a third or half pound of ground beef around seven to eighty percent lean i want this stuff fatty get a 10 to 12 inch pan either stainless or cast iron grease it up heat to medium high and once searing hot place your ball in the pan and press with a large spatula or burger press until a quarter inch thick and slightly wider than your buns season that generously with salt and pepper sear for one to two minutes flip season the other side to taste then add on one or two slices of provolone cheese and nice layer of your hot berea beef and just a gentle drizzle of your hot consummate on top and good lord and mercy anyway get two tostada add in a small handful of shredded oaxaca cheese melt that under a broiler or with a kitchen torch add some diced sweet onion to your desired level a light sprinkling of fresh chopped cilantro and top with another tostada now stack in this order carefully please

now time to put it in my mouth we have a beer or your burger so you may have seen this before where in los angeles we served about two several thousand goddamn people and now we're making it here but it's a little bit different the two sudden inspiration comes from a buddy of mine mark rosati thank you for giving me that by the way culinary director of shake shack no big deal it's fine dunk look at that glistening optionally we have a lime wedge or a cheek in this case oh i'm gonna need a paper towel for this one hey right there something special this is like a multiverse of texture i mean you've got the crunch from the toast on and then there's cheese on the inside it's like a cheesy tosada like a quesadilla almost the soft bread the aioli comes together not really an aioli it's like a mayo kind of thing burger obviously juicy delicious you know what a burger's like but then that birya juice it squirting into your mouth this is exactly what you would expect if you married both

we're doing jollibee chicken joy with a little bit of spaghetti versus mine this is one of the more specialty places that's been requested numerous times i have a lot of friends who love it and i've actually never had it so i'm excited to put it in my mouth and masticate until i understand what the flavors are like so i can then bust it wide open i do this with respect and love and i understand this is a big part of culture in the philippines it's a big part of filipino food and that this is also an homage towards that so with all that being said let's make this shall we yeah jollibee this guy's blocking my way get the out of my way you know what i just realized the other day was jollibee it's a beat first off the the the building's amazing exterior 10 and a 10. this is the best drive-thru i've ever been through hi can i just get the jollibee combo with spaghetti thank you she was very nice she did say good morning which i appreciate thank you wow that was fast okay so menu i love the chicken aspect for variety eight out of ten seven out of ten seven point seven two out of ten service nine out of ten only because they seemed kind of sad have you ever had someone say good morning twice to you that's how people get married that's how babies are made let's go we already threw the bag away oopsie first time having jolly bee chicken i did half spicy half normal although we're doing the normal version very sorry if you want to make it spicy i'll give you some alternative and then of course this spaghetti i know this is a big thing all right i want to be respectful but this is a little weird but hey gravy pretty good all right chicken this is the spicy one but i get the idea honestly it's kind of good i don't know if i can make fun of this i want to eat this this kicks kfc right in their kfpp and then the normal one me it's good damn it i will say this is breaded a lot better this is just like a flap of skin with no crisp that aside flavors they're really nice straightforward i'm gonna dip this in the gravy man i get the hype i really do now this on the other hand why does this exist it's so sweet it seems like chef boyardee it's like unholy and kind of good at the same time you walk into a room and you're like whoa whoa kind of scary in here there's demons and stuff but then like all the demons like really nice and like super chill chicken's great this is weird but not i don't i wouldn't eat this personally but can we make it better i don't know we gonna try right this is a whole ass meal so let's make this quick of course we have our gravy chicken and well the spaghetti i guess sauces in many cases should go first because we want to make sure that they feel loved so first up gravy medium sauce pan down add in 10 cloves of peeled garlic cover with one cup or 240 milliliters of vegetable oil and set over medium low let that come up and lightly cook swirling occasionally for five to seven minutes or until the garlic is golden brown and ultra soft strain the oil out pistify your garlic by pressing with the flat side of your knife and continuously chopping until you get a nice fine well paste separately in a medium saucepan add two tablespoons or 28 grams of unsalted butter 2 tablespoons or 28 grams of chicken fat or vegetable oil sit to medium heat and once that butter is melted and bubbling add in 4 tablespoons or 43 grams of all-purpose flour and let that cook stirring occasionally for about 45 seconds then with skin two cups for 480 milliliters of good chicken stock good stuff okay continuously stir until begins to thicken to a nice gravy like consistency adding chicken stock if it becomes a little too freaky anyway once that's done cut off the heat then season it with 1 to 2 tablespoons or 29 grams of silver swan soy sauce whisk in your confit garlic paste and salt to taste actually a little sprinkle [Music] pass the whole thing through a fine mesh strainer and you have a lovely gravy now the only other sauce is the jolly bee tomato sauce this one could be potentially a little bit different from the original but you know what i'll still give it a confused but respectful nod get at least a four quart sauce pan and add just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan heat over medium high till hotter than kendrick doing a dance during golden hour wow then add half a pound or 250 grams of diced smoked ham and five hot dogs sliced into half-inch coins whoa buddy reeling them horses i made these hot dogs from scratch with my own two hands so don't add me once those start to get some color lower the heat to medium and stir in five cloves of finely chopped garlic because i wrote it in the vo like that today that's garlic by the way once fragrant about 30 seconds add in a half cup for 120 grams of tomato paste cook and stir till that begins to caramelize in the bottom of the pan about one minute and then add in one and a half cups or 350 milliliters of chicken stock stir that in and follow that with a 24 ounce can of crushed tomatoes a quarter cup or 24 grams of granulated sugar and before you ask i couldn't physically bring myself to add any more sugar than that so many internal conflicts during this moment now bring that to a light boil reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes or until reduced and slightly thickened to something like this now season the taste of salt and that is your tomato sauce finally onto our chicken first off this is my favorite thing about jollibee no goddang breasts you know i've always avoided the breast when it comes to fried chicken and you know jollibee gets it so get a large bowl and fill it with two cups of 480 milliliters of buttermilk two teaspoons or five grams of garlic powder one teaspoon or two grams of ground white pepper one teaspoon or half a gram of ground coriander seeds begin whisking that and then add in two and a half tablespoons or 36 grams of specifically silver suan soy sauce and optionally you can add a touch of msg if you want to be a little bit naughty whisk all that together add in four chicken drumsticks and four chicken thighs all bone in and skin on for that juicy moist flavor toss to coat and marinate for five minutes at room temp but ideally let it sit overnight in the fridge then for the dredge get a separate large bowl add two cups or 375 grams of all-purpose flour one and a half tablespoons or 14 grams of kosher salty 2 teaspoons or 12 grams of one teaspoon of one gram of ground coriander seeds two teaspoons or eight grams of garlic powder one teaspoon or four grams of ground white pepper a quarter teaspoon or one gram of onion powder give it a nice whisk to help you forget the last ingredient of one teaspoon or one gram of ground ginger powder stir again and that is your dredge now please listen carefully here the way you coat your chicken is what makes this recipe if your fried chicken sucks it's probably for a lot of reasons but a big one is the coding technique i don't just release recipes like a bunch of these whack tic toc cooks and don't get me wrong i'm not talking about all of them but i show real techniques and i'm giving them so you can wield their power so please use them now in order to create appropriate flickage you need to mimic what a chicken shop has a lot of drippage in their dredge so dip your hand into your marinade and flick little dots of it onto your flower stir that in and repeat one to two more times and you should have tiny little balls dispersed in your flour that will flatten into a beautiful flake when you coat now pull your chicken from your marinade in batches drop it into your flour mix toss the coat making sure to get your dredge underneath the skin as well press aggressively to adhere a nice layer on every little nook and cranny and once it's fully coated with no bald spots your chicken is coated remember if it looks good dredged it's gonna look good fried repeat that with all your chicken gently lay your chicken into fry oil around 350 fahrenheit and fry for eight to ten minutes adjusting the attempt to keep them from getting too hot you want to cook before the crust gets too dark now once flaky like a goddamn croissant and the internal temperature reads 165 fahrenheit and your pule is done now for the spaghetti well please at least cook your spaghetti al dente in heavily salted boiling water and well you're ready to plate it up plate down followed by pisghetti the reddest tomato sauce in history cheddar cheese to hurt my heart fried chicken thigh and drumstick for that proper combo and finally your comfy garlic soy gravy now that looks like a jolly bee plate if i've ever seen one but it's time to decide a winner and to be honest i don't know how this is gonna go kendrick this one's for you i worked really hard on this kicked me right in the penis and with the gravy we won this is like the best piece of chicken we've made on this channel ever we'll do the spaghetti although i'm not really that crazed about it at this point it's all right obviously i prefer this one it's a lot less sweet there's more diversity in the texture of it and the hot dog's obviously being homemade i mean come on we have a taste tester today this right here little baby wearing a jolly b shirt that's this man right here my friend dan the man we go way back worked in restaurants together can you tell us a little bit about your experience with jollibee jollibee for me was like we would go to church and then my mom would take me to jollibee as like a thank you my first birthday was a jollibee my mom was like holding me to the mascot and i was like don't sting me damn this is really kinky you ever had that happen before not standing up chicken number two the first one i really like the crunchiness of it anything crunchy i'm sold on the second one i really like the pepperonis behind it a good combination of that would be a really good that would be chicken baby one would be my pick that's good on to the spaghetti are they gonna take my filipino card away man you're no longer brown it's definitely the first one the taste definitely like sticks to my mind there's a bit of an acidity in the second spaghetti which is a lot more mature but the first one i could definitely eat it and just like distinguish it from childhood it's really familiar to me so definitely the first one you can put the flavor in the chicken but you can't take away the culture and nostalgia honestly i think this is one of my favorite competitions i've ever done on but better jollibee honestly gets a gold star first but better in history that's ever gotten a gold star it's a tie we're gonna go hang this up together i want to make another joke but not with a baby in between us but you want to know what else is in between us b roll [Music] you

Baking Steel I use: https://amzn.to/3HHczL7
Another Baking Steel Option: https://amzn....",2022-11-30 21:59:44.385768, this feels like dangerous territory an endless battle waged to be ended [Music] so today it is italian versus american aka new york pizza let's go piss people off from got dang two different freaking continents what are you gonna do about that i know there's a lot of different american pizzas and there's a lot of different italian pizzas all right we picked two of my personal favorites new york and neapolitan they're both great pizzas so for the record before we even do this let's have it be a clean fight does that be a respectful fight and let's understand that pizza is delicious in many forms and i know that some people feel that the new york pizza is not a real pizza so let's define it today so with all that being said let's make this shall we so it's time we've got two very different doughs mr italiano which is just flour water salt yeast and the american version containing not only sugar but also being fermented completely different with significantly more yeast in a different type of flour first let's start off with the american pie in a container uh containing 617 grams of water add 14 grams of instant yeast and 25 grams of granulated sugar an italian pizza dough skin whisk that together and set to the side separately get a large bowl filled with 950 grams of all-purpose flour another italian scent now mix in 19 grams of fine sea salt by hand till combined pour your sugar yeasties into your flour mixture mix it by hand until you get a rough dough and then knead on a clean work surface until it starts to easily pull away from said work surface and you have a relatively smooth dough grease a bowl pop it into that greased bowl let that rise for one and a half to two hours at room temp or until two and a half times its original size punch it down divide it into 300 gram pieces lightly form into balls pop that into a pizza proofing box top of the lid and proof for three to four hours at room temp that's your got dang american do now moving on to i know i know settle down italians we love ya anyway get yourself 512 grams of water whisk in three to four grams of instant yeast until dissolved much less than before separately in a large bowl filled with 800 grams of devlo tepo flour not all purpose keep it italiano to that you'll add 16 grams of fine sea salt mix it by hand till combined add your yeasty juice and mix by hand until you get a rough dough need that for five to seven minutes or until you get a beautifully smooth and supple dough now lightly coat the bottom of your bowl with super duper virgin olive oil form your dough into a lightly taut ball plop into your big old bowl cover tightly with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 24 hours now once that's done punch it down form these into more dainty 250 gram pieces gently roll those into light balls pop into a floured pizza proofing box cover with the lid and proof for three to four hours at room temp now while those are going we'll make our american pizza sauce which ironically is the most involved in a medium sauce pot add 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of unsalted butter one tablespoon or nine grams of extra virgin olive oil let that heat and once the butter is melted and bubbling add in six cloves of rough chopped garlic saute just until fragrant then add two teaspoons or four grams of red pepper flakes i like a little spicy alright now let that cook stirring occasionally until the garlic is golden brown toasted then immediately add in a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes in a splash of water then to that you'll add two teaspoons or two grams of dried oregano one and a half tablespoons or 21 grams of italians plug your ears granulated sugar salt and pepper to taste and a light glug of olive oil bring that up to a boil on medium-high immediately reduce the heat to low and simmer for 12 minutes stirring occasionally until reduced and viscous like this beauty right here season that with salt until it's to your liking let that cool and that's your american pie sauce next up the italiano this one's significantly easier and simpler so get yourself a 20 ounce can of whole peeled italian san marzano tomatoes drain the liquid out of those and then gently squeeze each tomato to remove their excess water in a food processor place just those whole tomatoes along with three to four cloves of peeled garlic fresh ground black pepper and salt to taste and two tablespoons or 18 grams of your best olive oil blend that on high until as smooth as possible and that's it now let's finish these bad boys the italian one goes into a true 750 degree pizza oven and the american one into a hot home of it so for the american pie you'll need to preheat a baking steel or pizza stone in the middle of your oven around 500 degrees fahrenheit for at least 30 to 45 minutes before starting once done flour pizza peel generously grab one dough piece plop it down onto your work surface flour your dough generously then start by punching your dough down in the center working your way out to create a border about a quarter of an inch wide then pick the dough up drip it over your closed fists and rotate the dough around gently stretching as you go until you get a 13 to 14 inch pie layer on a couple tablespoons of your sauce starting in the center spreading in little circles working away to the edge until the pie is evenly beautifully coated like this separately we have a cheese mixture of two cups low moisture mozzarella two cups monterey jack and a half a cup of parmigiano-reggiano and i don't care if this is the american or italian version it's fresh grated now that's tossed together beautifully and sprinkled over your pizza to your heart's desire now load that into your oven onto your baking steel close and let it bake for five to seven minutes or until the edges get a nice deep golden brown and the cheese is bubbly melted pull that out and not gonna lie this thing looks pretty good dang good now hold your horses it's italian time shaping and saucing is the exact same here except this time you'll stretch this to no more than a 10 to 12 inch pie spread on your sauce and then add nice little chunks of fresh buffalo mozzarella big chunk here small chunk there have fun with it a couple of torn leaves of fresh basil wait a minute josh you can't cook base on the pizza that'll kill the flavor listen sweetheart if this is done traditionally and cooked quickly enough then yes it will lose a little flavor but it will also lightly perfume the pizza with that basil scent now optionally hit that with a glug of extra virgin olive oil move it into a 750 degree pizza oven cook for 30 seconds turn it halfway and cook for another 20 to 35 seconds take it out and that is a goddamn gorgeous pie now to finish we're gonna add some fresh torn basil leaves to bolster our now newly perfumed pizza now side by side sure they're from two different parts of the world but despite the differences maybe they can both see the beauty in each other but is there a winner let's find out pizza court is in session mamma mia we have two different pizzas they both look extraordinarily different let's begin with the smell this one kind of loses the smell test you've got the garlic the fresh tomato sauce you smell the char the smoke on this is mostly just cheese i'm picking up not a bad thing but i prefer this one it's good it's exactly what you think a new york pizza is going to taste like roughly right caramelized cheese this sauce is a little spicy a little sweet i like it i love it it's gonna be a bite i'm just gonna be straight up this to me is better period end of story sorry new yorkers i already whoa whoa stop i know you're freaking out well he didn't make it properly look been all over new york and had plenty of pizzas been all over italy and had plenty of pieces i'm making both of these pizzas so i'm using all of my professional knowledge to tell you i like this one more personal preference because this has more depth of flavor there's more layers to it i like that it's not so just heavy and late and it's balanced given either of these choices i'm not going to be upset because they're both equally delicious in their own way but we'll bring in some other representatives let the line begin [Music] i love new york i'm a big fan my father is from new york okay so i'm sorry the italian one's the winner they technically are the og so they deserve it but new york we still have love we still have heart for you and you have your place in this world you wanna know what else has a place in this world b-roll [Music] do [Music] you

Additional...",2022-11-30 21:59:44.385768, you can go and get a philly cheesesteak a relatively basic sandwich for this price right here i don't think so i think it should be this instead that is but cheaper [Music] so a great philly cheesesteak as we've seen in our philly cheesesteak episode is actually quite simple beef onion maybe salt pep cheese and sometimes mayo and ketchup you put in a bun and that's it it's such a basic sandwich but naturally the price is a little bit higher because it has steak in it expensive steak does it have to be expensive what do you think brother this is the one sandwich where you can leverage technique to make a cheap cut of meat taste unbelievably good so with all that being said let's make this shall we this sandwich is just dummy cheap it's slap your knee rip your pants off and call your grandma easy of course there is the aspect of bread sure yes hoagie bread if you can find some already made for cheap then great but it turns out making your own hoagie bread can be relatively simple and you can flex on your friends and family with it you made bread and therefore you're more powerful so get yourself one cup or 240 milliliters of whole milk at 95 fahrenheit with skin two teaspoons or eight grams of instant yeast and two and a half tablespoons or 33 grams of granulated sugar separately whisk together three cups for 450 grams of all-purpose flour and one teaspoon or three grams of fine sea salt till combined now you can do this by hand but if you use a stand mixer transfer the flour mix to the bowl of that turn on the medium low pour in your yeasty followed by two whole eggs now if needing by hand at this time you'll also add a quarter cup or 58 grams of vegetable oil and mix that together until smooth but if you're using that stand mixer i prefer to let this knead until combined and starting to smooth out and then i'll add a quarter cup or 58 grams of unsalted softened butter allowing that to fully incorporate until you have a smooth and supple dough which is about five minutes of kneading now roll into a rough ball please in a separate medium grease bowl cover the plastic wrap and rise for one hour fart and burp your dough turn it onto a work surface cut it into six even pieces about 145 grams each you roll those into light balls cover with a damp towel and rest for 10 minutes after that roll those bad boys into seven inch logs increasing pressure towards the ends to taper into pints place it on parchment lined baking sheet and repeat with the rest once they're all done cover those and let them proof for 25 minutes at room temperature then gently brush with egg wash consisting of one whole egg beaten with a splash of water till combined once they're all brushed top each of those with a light sprinkling of sesame seeds to coat the tops give them a light slash about a quarter inch deep with the razor across the entire top of the dough slam that brother into an oven set to 375 for 13 to 15 minutes or until they look like a hoagie roll from a goddamn cartoon uh golden brown ideally now let those cool completely on a wire rack and that's your bread so as they say get that blank get that bread and leave the actual sandwich is very very basic usually we'll use ribeye but the cheapest steak isn't just the chewy stuff all right there's another one out there that's well marbled and tender and it's the chuck blade steak many butchers will have it you just gotta ask get 2 pounds or 900 grams of that stuff make sure it's boneless and slice it against the grain no more than a quarter of an inch thick if you can go thinner then great freezing the meat for about 25 minutes before slicing will help you get it thinner if your knife is dull now the rest of this happens real quick so get your buns ready split the hoagie leaving a little bit of a back piece attached keep it all together and sure you can toast it but this is beautiful and warm from the oven so i'm just going to go straight into giving both sides a nice smear of mayonnaise and then to cook your booth either get a platcha or a large cast iron pan nice and hot over medium high coated with just enough oil to coat the bottom add in one diced sweet onion hit that with salt to taste and let that cook until just barely beginning to soften but you got some nice color going on now add all of your beef if there's not enough room you're gonna need to do this in batches spread it out so it gets full contact with the heat source and let that sear for about two minutes or until it starts to get some nice browning flip repeat on the other side and then wants to cook nicely but still juicy it's thin okay it's gonna get cooked through quickly which means it will dry out quickly so pay attention here chop it with a wooden spoon or a metal spatula tossing both the meat and the onion together to incorporate evenly now gather 1 6 of your meat in a mound that's roughly the shape of your bread so like a skinny football layer on one slice of provolone and one slice of white american cheese oh my god he's using american cheese yeah you know it's something that they do in philly all right you know usually it's one or the other thing but if you don't want to make decisions that day then do both i also doubled up on the cheese here which was a little too much so don't do that now once the cheese is melted pick that up with your spatula load up your sandwich and i'll be damned that is a beautiful looking philly cheese stick with no frills and who knows you know maybe the people philly are looking at this like hey what are you doing with the goddamn sandwich this is a culture you're messing with what do you think about that philadelphia accent not very good huh okay very sorry about that that being said hopefully this makes up for any wrongdoings with a great price but no loss of flavor so let's find out wow this looks a lot like our other philly cheese stick there's some small modifications to make a lot cheaper i'm a good singer i'm having flashbacks we went to philadelphia all the disappointments so many this is a resolution to those disappointments it is delicious it has all the textures you want it's cheesy it's rich it's fatty a lot of time people think oh you have to get this tough piece of meat that has no flavor and it's not juicy and has no fat in order to save money on a steak are you serious one of the quickest ways to make a steak tanner is cut it thin and guess what brother that's this philly cheesesteak right here this is everything that i would want in a philly cheesesteak and i genuinely don't feel much of a difference between this and the other one it's faster and cheaper what more do you want i know what you want you want b-roll [Music] [Music] you

the most expensive ingredients some interesting techniques how do you even make a breakfast sandwich that expensive eggs aren't that expensive but we can add other stuff we're not just gonna throw caviar on this we're doing a bunch of other fancy things so with all that being said let's make this shall we you know a breakfast sandwich for this price kind of like a deli BEC that's uh making a cheese it's basic but there's still Technic involved but then there's a sandwich with chicken fried Iberico pork Secreto gruyere foam Iberico jowl bacon and got dang caviar let's start with Mr Simple cause I know you'll get that one the lead three to four slices of cooked bacon cook it however you like all right I popped mine into an oven that was cold and set it to 425 Let It Go for 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked to your liking separately get some sliced white bread which I toasted in butter in a pan on both sides until beautifully golden brown once it's done set those to the side now per sandwich I really like three whole eggs all right now get a 10 to 12 inch non-stick skillet depending on how many eggs you're cooking add one to two tablespoons of unsalted butter turn the heat to medium separately crack three whole eggs into a bowl season lightly with salt and pepper whisk those together until homogeneous and once your butter is hot and booblin add a new your eggs just like an omelette you let the egg cook while constantly dragging the edges to the center as they begin to set slowly shaping this into a square shape about the same size of your bread now here's your trick to nice eggs as soon as they're 75 of the way cooked through and just the top is a type of liquidy cut the heat off and gently cover it with plastic wrap or lid and let it finish cooking by steaming itself for 30 seconds then immediately remove that lid and you got crazy got dang scrambled egg now for the assembly get your toasted bread put on some mayo on both toasts on the bottom layer stack your bacon nicely followed by your Earth a nice layer of cheddar cheese melt with a torch or under a broiler if desired and then Crown your king obviously Mayo side down and that is a breakfast sandwich that may be simple and kind in stature but satisfying and Powerful in flavor the expensive one is a bit of a different story first off a basic gruyere foam now get the finest gruyere that you can find we need about one pint total of cube gruyere papanino blender along with three cloves of garlic then in a medium saucepan add 1 quart or 800 milliliters of heavy whipping cream heat that just until steamy hot but not boiling then poor Daddy's real hot train into your blender starting with just about three quarters of said now let that rip on the blender until as smooth as possible it should come out a bit like a Mornay sauce so if it's too thick add the rest of your queen then one smooth and emulsified pour that into an isi whipped cream canister hit it with one charge shake it nicely until it creates a beautiful microphone like this next chicken fried Secreto you need two nap pounds or 1.1 kilograms of iberica pork Secreto or Pressa if it's too thick slice it into steaks about a third of an inch thick and pound it out if needed separately get a medium sized bowl and add one and a half cups or 295 milliliters of Buttermilk half a teaspoon or two grams powder one tablespoon or 12 grams of garlic powder 1 teaspoon or 3 grams of espalet one teaspoon or two grams of ground cumin half a teaspoon or less than a gram of ground white pepper and two teaspoons or 6 grams of fine sea salt whisk together until thoroughly combined then add your pork to your marinade and allow to soak for five minutes and it's breading time now first simply drizzle a little bit of your marinade into the flour mixture mix that to incorporate into the flour and guess what you get extra flake now take a piece of pork toss it into your flour pressing aggressively to get that nice crust once fully coated shake off the excess place on a sheet tray and repeat with the rest now to cook get a six to eight quart heavy bottom pot filled up about halfway with vegetable oil heat it to 350 Fahrenheit and then drop in one to two of your secretos at a time frying for four to six minutes now while that's going let's get our bacon started here we have an ibergo pork chow bacon nice and pricey for that guy too pop that onto a baking sheet and into the oven at the same temperatures before and these cook a lot faster so try to keep it maybe 10 to 15 minutes until golden brown and honestly I like these guys crisp they have an insane texture when they're stiff now back to Frying the pork once each piece is done it should be a golden brown flaky gem emerging from a pool of shimmering gold now pop that on a wire rack said over baking sheet hit it with salt to taste and repeat with the rest all we have left is a luxury scrambled egg which will go the Fine Dining soft scrambled method first whisk together two eggs then in a cold non-stick pan set over medium heat add one and a half tablespoons of unsalted butter I'd love that to just barely melt and pour in your eggs immediately begins stirring with a plastic heat proof spatula and let those cook while constantly stirring and shaking the pan and what you'll notice is eventually the eggs will just barely start to curdle a little bit once that happens remove the pan from the heat continue to stir gather up those cook bits quickly Place back on the heat again continuing to stir once you see those curds pick up again guess what remove it from the heat again stretch your stir back onto the heat off on you know you've seen this before all right and once the eggs are cooked but are extremely fine curd and velvety fluid like this they're done optionally add a dollop of creme fraiche to keep Gordon happy a touch of salt to taste and some very thinly sliced chives fold together and that's your soft scramble the bread we'll be using is the finest most voluminous crusty sourdough bread I have a recipe for that in my cookbook Link in the description you could also go to a local bakery that makes great bread now slice that bad boy nice and thicky Wiki and toasted in butter on both sides until deeply toasted and luxurious to assemble grab your big boy toast on the bottle give a generous layer of your gruyere foam okay don't skimp on me here followed by your gel bacon a stunning Jewel of fried Secreto a chunky dollop of your sauce scrambled egg and lastly for the excess of this entire recipe a generous ounce or two of your nicest caviar maybe a little Platinum Etc gently top that monstrosity with your bread crown and look at that never have we seen a sandwich so horrendous and also equally lustworthy it's hard to put it into words why I hate and maybe even love this sandwich but I'd rather eat it and tell you if it's worth the price all right we got two different breakfast sandwiches right here one for breakfast and the other for breakfast the only difference is that when you finish this you're probably not gonna leave your house and probably you might wanna this price and this price this is significantly larger but I could have made it smaller and it would have been still significantly more now that is a classy cross section hey if you've ever had a classic bacon egg and cheese wherever Bodega jelly doesn't matter there's a certain flavor that you already know is on the way this is exactly that and more the cookery of the eggs the toast on the bread every element that you control will contribute to the quality of the sandwich so there's nothing wrong with it it's great onward to Mr expensive with an egregious amount of caviar it's a perfect medium cooked pork Secreto chicken fried Iberico bacon soft scrambled egg that's a lot oh I also forgot about the Alpine cheese foam I'll give it a little bit a little bit more why not that's just overload it's too much I don't know how I feel about this all of these flavors work really well you've got the Chive soft scrambled egg it's buttery the crunch from the chicken fried pork Secreto the spices there's a symphony that Alpine cheese foam is actually quite light it's not too much but this is the problem with going too hard on too many things there's just too many different contrasting textures and flavors and fat and creaminess and creamy that it's just too much this is one of those things where I just feel like something simple like a classic breakfast sandwich is never gonna do you wrong now if you want to be a disgusting little piggy well then you might enjoy this sandwich still gonna be good but honestly spend all this money and I kind of want this one but that's what this episode is all about it's not about the money that you spend it's about the technique and it's about applying the right textures the right flavors in the right place for an incredible experience but you wonder what else is an incredible experience b-roll foreign [Music]

gold [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today we are making the burger king original chicken sandwich i gotta say it is original it's long there are certain things that don't need to be long call me crazy right they have the craziest ad i've ever seen with this chicken sandwich too they basically were like mcdonald's chicken sandwich i don't even know if you can advertise like that anymore but i can tell you that we can advertise like that so with all that being said let's make this shall we the burger king sign shining through the shell station and not only that but they advertise free wi-fi i'm at a loss for words good lord this place is beat up three tier rating system the uh the exterior one out of ten don't ask me why menu we already know what it's gonna be actually you know what we'll set a new precedent the new precedent is five out of ten oh they did add that chickens the chiquing 5.5 out of 10 for that photo that's a good photo can i get uh two original chicken sandwiches thank you oh wow that's really cheap five dollars for two sandwiches i don't think we'd be making this for a bunch cheaper so far this is the longest to go we've ever had with oh it's lunch time all given thank you you too service i'm gonna give uh today an 8 out of 10. very good nice easy simple love to say more but i guess we'll just eat this sandwich that i don't want to eat so we've got the bag this is probably one of my favorite designs i've ever seen in a fast food bag and i really mean that it's straightforward to the point no one's looking or caring okay they want to eat so that they can have fire really i was looking for the sauce but there wasn't much to be found oh here's some of it they're supposed to be mayo on both sides now this looks like modern art oh i've regained my composure the salt levels are good everything else is bad not crispy i don't taste the chicken at all the lettuce is hardly present the mayo is not present and there's this horrific and when i say horrific i mean bitter aftertaste that i cannot describe anywhere else and i'm not sitting on it for the sake of showing on it i will never put one of these in my mouth again this is gonna be better okay bye many times bread is optional in this case it's gonna be hard to find anything like the bk chicken bun aside from maybe a hoagie roll of sorts and i think we can make ours better in the bowl of a stand mixer add three cups or 450 grams of all-purpose flour one teaspoon or three grams of fine sea salt give that a mix pop it onto your stand mixer with the twirly thing separately whisk together one cup for 240 milliliters of whole milk and two and a half teaspoons or nine grams of instant yeast followed by two and a half teaspoons or 11 grams of sugar whisk that together turn on your stand mixer onto low add that whole mixture to your flour along with two whole eggs let that bad boy mix until you get a rough dough then add in a quarter cup or 58 grams of unsalted softened butter let that mix and incorporate once it returns to a homogeneous dough let that knead for five more minutes or until you get an obnoxiously smooth supple dough ship it into a toit ball pop it into a grease bowl cover with plastic wrap and rise for one hour or until doubled in punch that bad boy down divide into eight even pieces about 95 to 105 grams each shape those into rough balls then let your balls rest due to the fondling for about seven minutes cover with greased plastic wrap and then gently roll those bad boys into seven inch long demi baguette like shapes think short fat baguette with chubby tips plop that onto a greased parchment lined baking sheet with no more than six sausages now lightly flatten those buns down just a touch cover with greased plastic wrap and proof for 20 minutes at room temperature now take your absolute sausages brush with egg wash consisting of one egg and a splash of water beaten together then give them a generous sprinkle of untoasted sesame seeds and optionally give them a nice score at a 45 degree angle with a razor if you want that good split top now pop that into an oven that's been preheated to 375 fahrenheit for about 16 to 18 minutes or until a beautiful golden brown and puffed optionally brushed with melted butter while they're still hot and cool completely on a wire rack tada bk chicken buns but you know not flaccid and deeply saddening right sauce and toppings for this sandwich are super basic lettuce mayo and well that's it very simple you know you can't hide bad food behind simple ingredients and well they didn't since mayo is obviously an important element here i would highly recommend you make it fresh just get a medium sized bowl toss in two plump egg yolks one and a half tablespoons or 25 grams of dijon mustard half a teaspoon or two grams of sugar salt to taste two cloves of garlic optionally a small pinch of ground white pepper whisk it together and then while continuously whisking starting with a very very very light drizzling of one cup or 200 grams of vegetable oil starting with just a couple drops at a time once it begins to emulsify you can start to increase that stream and just keep gradually adding that oil and whisking and adding and whisking until you have a beautifully thickened mayo and chances are you may end up needing another quarter cup or a half cup of oil depending on the egg yolk size and you know that it's thickened properly when it gets that good mayo jiggle like this let me tell you that mayo jiggle should have you blushing i'll tell you what now add in a quarter cup of 60 grams of creme fraiche and the zest of one lemon that's been very finely chopped mix it up and wow that's an incredibly luxurious despite its simplicity lettuce is well let us just get a nice butter lettuce separate it clean it nicely and well that's it now for the all-important chicken they used a patty so we'll make our most juicy chicken patty yet get a meat grinder look you can use a food processor although you won't get as fine of a grind but if you want to be legit then yes use a got dang grinder i know not everyone can get one but i've proven that you can grind me with a knife just stop making excuses now grind together one pound or 450 grams of chicken breast and a quarter pound or 113 grams of pork fat back what pork fat i thought this was chicken look totally true but that pork fat is gonna make for that nice juicy juicy squirt squirt and you want that now give that farce no not fart a nice need then add in two teaspoons or six grams of kosher salt two teaspoons or six grams of garlic powder two teaspoons or six grams of nutritional yeast three quarters of a teaspoon of three grams of fresh ground black pepper a quarter teaspoon which is less than one gram of onion powder give it a nice mix by hand kneading it together thoroughly until combined and that is your chicken farce now evenly separate that into four chicken patties depending on the thickness you want i like mine thick so i did four the one thing i will say is that this chicken is only good cooked fresh so please don't make more unless you are serving more than four guests now wrap that in plastic wrap and chill in the freezer for 15 minutes while that's chilling give yourself a katsu style breading setup you know the trio of crunch the trinity of crisp one bowl with one and a half cups or 113 grams of panko bread crumbs another bowl with two eggs and one and a half tablespoons or 19 grams of water and finally one with about one and a half cups or 225 grams of all-purpose flour pull out your stiffy chicky patty toss in the flour fully coat shake off the excess dip two coat completely in your egg wash and finally coat and firmly press your panko bread crumbs to coat every little nook and cranny okay no goddamn bald spots repeat with all your patties and then drop those bad boys into a pot filled with vegetable oil that's been heated to 350 fahrenheit and fry those bad boys two to three at a time depending on the size of your pot for 46 minutes or until a beautiful golden brown crisp on the outside and juicy fully cooked breast on the inside just be careful not to over fry these or they will dry out and i mean come on look at these they look simply ridiculous like the most beautifully meaty hash brown crunch made of lustful dreams now season it with salt if you like or if you won't be a little dirty hit it with some mushroom seasoning powder which you can find at many asian markets now repeat with all your chicky and get ready for the easiest assembly on but better so still on both cut sides in butter hit them generously with your mayo on both cut sides and this stuff is so delicious it should be illegal so don't be scared to put too much mayo alright it's real good follow that with a beautiful fried chicken patty a nice layer of the finest butter lettuce you can find and finally crown a sandwich that is truly fit to be a king now let's find our winner wow this sandwich looks sickly like it belongs in a hospital bed oh lord look at this that was a big bite there is simply no comparison of this sandwich to this press the life alert button help me i've fallen i can't get up now we need a taste tester vikram today a long time no ceo my gosh where have you been this whole time as he's in the room every day there we go who knows what that one was number two number one no contest so bad there's a reason why this one's going off the menu and they're making a new chicken sandwich this is exciting every component of it is fantastic there's no comparison the funny thing is you don't have to make your own buns for this to be incredibly good by the way you could totally skip the bun making process you can grind the chicken using a food processor there are ways to make this significantly easier and more accessible you can still make this sandwich thank you vikram you can have your mediocre sandwich take it back i don't care we won this is a butt better you want to know what else is but better b-roll [Music] you

faster than a restaurant [Music] chicken alfredo should be a quick meal it's almost like it was invented to be but there's many caveats you go to a restaurant and the chicken's dry there's not enough pasta or it takes too long for the delivery you wait 30 minutes for your delivery and you get a clump one mask we're making a relatively simple chicken alfredo but with all the proper culinary techniques and a little bit of uh rule breaking but the point is to make this as flavorful as gourmet as anywhere else you would get it we're gonna have someone place the order go and get it and we have to make it before they get back so let's begin hello thank you for calling thank you for calling can i get a chicken alfredo please 15 minutes thank you recipe on the website i really want the skin on the chicken thighs i'm going to use like skin on chicken thighs but the bone is going to cause it to take too long to cook so yes i am going to remove the bone oh why would you do that such a waste of time because that's how much i believe in myself i believe in myself so much that i'm taking extra time for the deliciousness of this despite despite the point of the show i make a little incision down the middle and then i get my fingies worked under there see that take the knife get under there and scrape down the sides and remove the bone you can save that for stock spinning let's gonna be a dub today you wouldn't know why cause i know a guy named alfredo and guess what he has a chicken pan medium high oil make sure the skin's dry salt got our pepper oh i gotta get water boiling season our chicken with salt hang on i gotta get 10 to this water all right all right that's heating this is hot that's what you want to hear it's going to naturally want to shrink what are we going to do about that at these beautiful presses press that i go over here and season my wawa look at that oh so much salt salt you know it's a good vibe we're all in for but hey michael jordan didn't make varsity so did you make varsity bro sure i got knocked out in a few concussions but hey i was on varsity get this little peppy more salt sweet cheeses bing bang pecorino parmesan a lot of time you might ask yourself oh should i buy that cre-grated stuff the second that you think that i want you to stop thinking walk down the aisle and spank yourself with a piece of parmigiano use fresh grated you're literally just eating potato starch that's how they keep it from clumping together you're gonna get the wrong sauce texture i hope he drops his chicken on the floor yeah i said it okay this chicken's ready to flip oh good lower that's done turn the heat off get a glove pop it into a preheated oven and just let it finish in there don't do anything else so we got a parmigiano about a half cup grated pecorino saute pan meat is on medium cream goes in daddy's cream of course butter well that's heating we do multiple things at once try to combine tasks that's how you're gonna speed this whole process up four cloves of garlic crushed and i am going to fine chop these shout out to the comments section i love y'all keep the comments rolling give me secrets to defeat this man because i know they're out there the chicken alfredo that we know today as i've said before is not traditional definitely an american thing but it does come from fettuccine alburo and if you want to know how to make that the links in the description see i can even save time for promo and also don't forget to buy my book too if you haven't links in the description for that while we're at it make it drop so this is taking a while to boil guess what makes water boil fast a lid man we're going to the back streets bro i ain't go nowhere but i'm back lights everywhere and all of them are red it's a setup come on cream cream for me cream is the greatest emulsifier ever and a lot of restaurants use it as a crutch but i also do next up fresh thyme right these are going to go in last i'm gonna add the time now that means i'm lying by having a wider larger pan it's gonna reduce significantly faster you want your sauces to reduce faster more surface area period a little bit of pepper is this ready almost not really about to make pressure cooker pasta i guess i can clean while i'm waiting they gotta stop sending me to these confusing places bro this is a defeat we've been at this like for like five minutes this is a hell ah there it is this was about to boil and it stopped i don't know how that's possible this is on full blast all right that's close enough so i have store-bought pasta if we finish this fast enough i'll also make a fresh one if you think that the restaurant that we're going to is making the pasta and cutting it to order you are insane they're not all right back to this i mean this is pretty much there how much else to do this all right well we have time we're just sitting here so i might as well just make pasta there it is all right we're gonna plug that into my stand mixer i'm using the uh the motorized one because it's faster we got a recipe from the cookbook right here if you're wondering where i got this pasta dough came straight from my cookbook cookbook created it for me it has hands all right you're gonna quarter this pre-shape it a little bit turn this on pasta make a little tighter you can prep the dough in advance and leave it in the fridge and it's fine one day only no more than a day okay faster spongebob got the bag it's half time on the way back you know i'm a second half guys start off slowing at first but always coming clutch you got to believe in yourself you're about to get this dub they just picked it up maybe i'm being a little silly by doing this that's the noodle length where's our pasta at right now that's just hard to rock we got our cutter look at that boom fettuccine lovely that is half a pound of pasta i could do this one more time and i'll have a full pound of pasta which is already in there i probably should have done this i could have cooked this in one minute this is still cooking literally two more minutes doing this one more minute doing that i think i might have actually outpaced the pasta are you the fastest kid at recess i could i could have gone pro i could have been in the league what league google me pasta's ripping it's nearly there i think we jump back over here turn this up get our whisk ready and let's let's finish the business all right cheese is getting added we're gonna stir that in increase the heat more about half that that's emulsifying it's mixing it's creamifying and then all of it five minutes away we got five minutes gentlemen of course of course josh paid this guy to be right here caution wide turn shouldn't be more cautious at 10 miles per hour huh that is so hot in my hand that i just did pasta's done that's ready heat up garlic in fresh nutmeg just a little bit all right you don't need a lot mix that in i want to get a little bit of that pasta water in there so i'm going to pull this out with my tongs into the sauce see i'm getting water in there josh what the hell are you doing um i'm making an amazing sauce what are you doing stinky mix mix mix look at this look at this pasta out in out in chickens in the oven that i forgot about chicken's done yeah on parmigiano he's too wide the refs are getting paid that's what's going on i'm putting this fresh pasta in there and i'm gonna make more in here all right we're boiling so round two i think i'm getting a little bit of buzz vikram a little bit of pasta water in there a little bit

price that is but cheaper [Music] ah beer battered crispiness hot fresh fries with the crunch you got a good dip some ketchup maybe a little bit of multivine and you're just wasting a whole lot of money on a cheap cut of fish all because you don't want to take the 20 minutes that it takes to prep it it's real easy no more excuses so let's make this shall we this recipe is gummy easy borderline foolproof let's begin with the sauce full stop you know i really hope sauce is high on your energy chart or whatever you're using these days for astrology i don't know because sauce is one of the pinnacle elements of great food get yourself two serranos ideally char those over an open flame if you have a gas stove if not it's okay to skip that now if you are charring once they're done charred all over you know tip the stem let those steam covered in a bowl for five minutes peel them remove their stems and toss them into a food processor or blender along with the juice of one lemon three cloves of garlic and a splash of water if needed to loosen blend that as smooth as possible now weirdly enough a tiny tiny splash of vegetable oil will actually smooth it out and pre-emulsify it as well but that's also optional in a medium-ish bowl add one cup or 230 grams of mayonnaise one shallot very finely diced optionally one dill pickle finely diced the zest of one lemon one teaspoon or 14 grams of mustard and of course your serrano puree season that the taste with salt if needed stir together till combined and that sauce is good enough to dip your big ol cod in any day next up the chips here we go the english doing their thing again look i love you all seriously anyway get yourself four russet potatoes pop them into an oven preheated to 400 degrees fahrenheit for about one hour or just until fork tender and this is the real secret here pop those bad boys into the fridge to chill overnight this is going to completely change the start structure so you get that nice crispy crunch now magically the next day wow cut those rusted potatoes in half and then into thirds or quarters depending on how thicky you want these bad boys to be and yes we're making a steak fry one that you'll actually desire from there drop those beautiful fries into a heavy bottom pot filled with a little over halfway with vegetable oil heated to around 360 degrees fahrenheit fry those in three to four batches letting them cook until deeply crispy golden brown and when i say deep i mean deep crust look at this thing it's like a goddang kettle cooked chip on the outside and fluffy like a cumulonimbus on the inside this is what a proper steak fry should always be like moving on to the fish thankfully fish and chips already uses one of the most affordable types of fish cod but you can totally go cheaper that being said i'd recommend going to an asian market because sometimes they have great prices for fish and the quality is gonna be a lot safer now cut that fish into two and a half to three inch fillets we should chew around eight to ten pieces season that fish to taste with kosher salt on all sides and let it sit at room temp for eight minutes this will dry out the excess water from the fish so it's soiled firm and it stays crispy after frying now for the dredge in a medium bowl add one cup or 150 grams of all-purpose flour one teaspoon or half a gram of baking powder one teaspoon or five grams of kosher salt 1 tsp or 3 grams of garlic powder whisk until thoroughly combined and then slowly whisk in one and a quarter cup or 240 milliliters of cold light beer look use whatever you have in the fridge it's fine but do be careful not to over whisk this into a frothy mess otherwise you get no kisses and at that point you might as well stop cooking now once it all comes together you should have a nice batter that's thick enough to cling to your finger but isn't doughy think you know tempura batter but slightly more fake after that pet your fish try oh little man you're going into the oil now toss a piece of fish in plain all-purpose flour to coat shake off the excess give it a nice dunk in your batter and immediately transfer to your fryer from earlier it's gonna be the same temp as before 350 to 375 it's all good now fry those bad boys for two to four minutes or until you get an undeniably golden crisp piece of fish so light it might just float out

have a bunch of me some place in front of you i have a pot do you have a pot got a little sauce pocket little induction olive oil just a couple tablespoons got a little bit of bacon in front of you you slice those into sort of quarter inch little pieces strips yeah little strips no i'm slicing this the wrong way you're saying slice it short like the short side into like little batons is that like a little baton once your bacon's chopped that's going to go in your pot i'm going to crank that up to medium give it a little stir coat it in the olive oil it'll release its own fat it should be quite a bit because what it'll do is it'll emulsify the tomatoes so just kind of stir it around let that cook this is going to cook just for a few minutes while that's going you should see a few garlic cloves in front of you how do you feel about your knife skills scale of 1 to 10 10 being like i can out pace you 100 10 no no no no 100 you cannot pace me not 100 oh okay okay i'm gonna go with a solid seven oh okay do i think too highly of myself so once all your garlic is sliced well i'm almost there really yeah how's that possible oh my god i'm slow sliced oh this is gonna be a challenge toss that in with your bacon this is what i like to call oh my god it smells so good in here starter pack bacon garlic olive oil beautiful red fresno chili so really easy to break down pop that onto your board cut the top off and then a little bit of the tip and then you're going to cut down the side of it and around and almost sort of unfold it cut those sheets into little thin strips you're then going to cut across that to get nice little cubes all right so red fresno chili diced a little bit of salt to draw out that water stir that toss that looking lovely you're going to add about a teaspoon of your red pepper flake a bouquet garni of thyme whole thing branches and all i have no idea what's happening your crushed tomatoes which will go directly in all of it san marzano proper italian the whole thing the whole thing okay good because i already did it so salt goes in throw that together let that emulsify let it simmer and reduce nice soft light simmer a no stress it should be whispering to you this pesto is not beloved by the italians we're making a controversial pasta making a controversial pesto garlic all of it not all your pine nuts but just a couple handfuls a little sprinkle of salt all of your basil we should have brought some stuff from your garden i know how's the zucchini farm going it's pretty epic actually i'll buy like two succulents and they're like oh you can't kill these and then in three weeks they're dead really dead i'm sorry for your loss you're gonna add just a splash of water the water is just there to help loosen it low speed little bit of water i put too much water while it's blending yeah stream in about three tablespoons of olive oil i added too much water i just screwed myself oh my god am i gonna win this challenge uh no no olive oil in i went way too hard on the water his ears nice and thick and emulsified sort of kind of yeah yeah we both made a mistake today it's fine it's gonna taste good and i have a remedy i think empty bowl you're gonna add all your mayo okay a half cup roughly if it's very liquidy go with a couple tablespoons of that and that'll thin out the mayo into a nice sort of vibrant green sauce you should end up sort of like a pastel green season it add your pesto how are you feeling about these elements looking good yes wait did you say about these almonds i don't have almonds did i say almonds oh about all of this all of this all of this we have chops pop that down on your board i know chives don't seem like something to belong enough chicken farm and they don't but i do what i want so you're going to slice your chives very very very thin so my chives are sliced you don't need a slice just just half how is she moving so quick get your mozzarella into your mozzarella you'll see a little bit of fine grated parmigiano do you see that sprinkle that in there all of it we like it cheesy toss it together did you see that that heist where these dudes stole 25 thousand dollars of parmesan rice yeah put it back wait wait put it back how much cheese is that a wheel uh nothing to see here gentlemen baguette oh merci cut it right in half do you prefer your sandwiches to me oh wow you've got like a power i had to i had to change my stance that's like a bulgarian split squad 100 wow yeah i'm glad you saw that i just learned what that is oh started working out you could outlift me i don't think so very easily so we're going to split this in half like a thicker top that's a really good question i go half and half you know some people prefer a thicker bottom lighter top higher top lighter bottom twitter's going to go nuts with these clothes enjoy what's wrong oh no i just felt really good to cut the bread all the way through oh my god if i cut myself i'm not gonna go ah all that's left to do spread our chicken fry it and assemble you have three bowls one with flour one with panko and one with egg in a small bowl so those two eggs crack it in tell me a little bit about how you crack your eggs that's a very good question counter always if i'm cracking two at a time because i can do two at a time um i'll use the side of the bowl because it's the only way i can get my thumb in there unfortunately okay so those are these quotes man so salt to the flour mixture take a piece of chicken and you're going to lay that down on your cutting board and with your knife kind of cut it in half open it up kind of like a book press it out with the palm of your hand get it nice and flat what's wrong with it all right so once the chicken's all pounded out so you're first going to go into your flour give it a little tip shake off the excess gently lay it in your egg wash flip it get it nice and coated every side immediately oh i'm just gonna i'm just gonna split these into your panko how much experience you have frying stuff i have experience that's good okay grab it with two hands just sort of daintily like you're picking up a little funny hat this is how i would pick up a

short rib and cooking it for three whole days you know you can cook it for 69 hours or you can cook it for 72. you pick which one do you think is a better number huh i would pick 69. i just like that number not only we're going to cook this for an excessive amount of time sure it's going to be tender and lovely and voluptuous but how does it change what's going to taste like one day two day three day taste each of them and then we're gonna show you how to use it or if it's worth it at all so with all that being said let's make this shall we you know what's funny about this though this is perhaps one of the longest cook times for a piece of meat it's also one of the most hands-off first you're gonna need well short ribs about five pounds of them ideally you want one of these and good lore this isn't just a short rib this is the rib plate which is much more ideal for this recipe and well get more meat or you could use pre-cut if you like season that very generously with salt and pepper all over every little nook and cranny pop that bad boy into a vacuum bag vacuum it and carefully lower it into a sous-vide water bath that's been preheated to 140 fahrenheit and now the clock starts you got 72 hours let's pull it out at the 24 hour marker and see what we've got going on looks nice it looks cooked it's firm but there's also some tenderness to it bones are starting to get exposed but not completely tunnels like it ain't done yet unfortunately we have to pull this whoa we got a 24 hour short rib right here you know it looks and feels like a medium rare steak which is actually pretty interesting to me sounds like one too that's 24 hours of work wow extraordinarily good i can't wait for restaurants to catch on this one damn it's kind of like a cross between the center part of the rib eye medium rare mixed with a new york strip it has like a density to the bite it's bitey but it's not like chewy at all so it's almost like the perfect medium rare stick with the right amount of fat ratio you ever want a steak and you want the marbling but then you got to deal with a little bit more chew all right real happy about this discovery but let's see what 48 hours does now we're on the 48 hour marker honestly not much more moisture loss on this one in comparison to the last but textually and physically this feels different i can tell by the way my knife fell through it and visually you know it actually kind of doesn't look bad cut a piece off and it looks sort of like a medium rare steak but let's taste test all right 48 hours i trimmed the fat off this one that's why it looks a little funny this somehow looks more medium rare than the last one juicy this is totally different it looks like it's medium rare it's definitely cooked all the way through it's more of like a cure look that you're getting from it being a soupy goddamn in between two planes of existence plane one is like prime rib plane two is like a pot roast prime rib pot roast and then they have a baby and it's this it's got a stick like mouth feel but zero chewiness starting to pick up some tenderness that you would from a slow cook doesn't quite melt in your mouth but it falls apart in your mouth love this this is great weirdly not as excited about this as the last one hopefully the 72 hour one will do it for me on to the holy moment of short rib history a full three-day 72 hour short rib emerges there wasn't much moisture lost between the 24 and the 48 but the jump from the 48 to the 72 is massive in terms of its juicy so for this we're gonna handle it a bit differently take it out of your sous vide leave it in the bag and then place it on a small sheet tray that it fits nicely on place another equally sized sheet tray on top of that and evenly weigh it down with something like a cast iron skillet or some heavy cans place it in the fridge overnight to press and this is a very common restaurant industry technique what this is going to do is you'll get beautiful cuts of meat that are flat sear beautifully and heat evenly now once this comes out of the fridge sieve all that gelatinized because you're going to use that later now cut that bad boy into individual long boy ribs and before we get to cooking let's make a very basic glaze one cup of granulated sugar half a cup of vinegar bring that to a boil over high heat until it turns a light golden color then whisk in three quarters of a cup of your beef juice season it to taste with dark soy sauce so it's got a nice balance of salty sweet about three tablespoons and well that's it feel free to add some spicy stuff like a tablespoon of non-prick pow or spicy chili crisp and you've got a beautiful glaze now let's finish this we're not doing this with voiceover because it's real fast pan 12 inches it's pretty big huh oil medium high a little bit hot so add that in oh jesus we're going to sear every side be you if lay really the goal is just to get color glaze and heat it through you don't need to do a lot more the little flip ah good lord look at the crispy bits just render out all that fat look at this tilt the pan just let that fat render out the heat is off i'm gonna strain that off and immediately glaze it nicely just one side porch or a broiler rush that lightly okay and you can see that glaze starting to bubble up it's reducing on the surface of the meat earn that glaze again broil glaze again every side onto the plate and serve this whatever you want potatoes rice vegetables this is how you make the meat daddy's meat i demolished the plate for the b-roll sorry i've not eaten it yet though and i've gotta say visually smelly is good a little bit of flaky salted finish that's a different vibe right there it's hard to choose a favorite here i would say my least favorite is the 48 hour one that one get on out this is completely different than the 24. sort of close to the 48 but a lot more tender you end up getting that slow cooked beef you ever have a pot roast and it's like melts in your mouth right you're getting that except zero zero dryness if you want the moistest slow cooked beef of your life this is the route to go kind of teetering between this and the 24 hour one you would think this is astronomically better but it's just different but if you do want it to fall apart then 72 hours is the only way it doesn't matter which one you choose because they're all unique in their own way so choose your own adventure but do you want to know how else you can choose your own adventure by me showing you how to use this a couple other ways let's do it oh yes a 72 hour short rib what in the do you do with that it takes many forms and we'll be showing you two versions a beautiful taco cheesy and delightful and an incredible short rib sandwich filled with your hearts delights and caramelized onions let's begin we have meat i've reheated more of it got it just shred this you could use it whole in a sandwich sure but i want it shredded i want the fine little threads we worked so hard on it right just shred that real fine let the fat emulsify make it look good if you don't mind everyone leave the ring please i need to be alone with this bowl so we have our meat it's been shredded it's fatty it's juicy delicious now we put it in something we're starting with a simple taco very basic pan medium heat a little bit of the beef fat from earlier right we're returning to the earth by reusing instead of throwing away see the vegans should be happy about this that's a joke that's a joke it's a joke vegan teacher is over there like tortilla down get that soaked up with beef fat nicely going on medium high gonna let that heat now while that's going take some of your oaxaca cheese you can also use fresh mozzarella but it's not the same it's really not so try to find the wok and cheese so on one side i'm gonna add that cheese okay that's sitting just for the sake of speed i'm gonna melt it you don't have to do this but i want to you'll notice the tortilla is gonna get a little crisp that's fine okay relax fat's gonna rehydrate it cheese is melting looking beautiful our beautiful 72 hour short rib directly on there it's got a texture at this point similar to barbacoa and then carefully fold and press very lightly okay look at that cheese coming out she's gonna continue to melt it's mixing with that beautiful beef the fat oozing okay let it get crisp on that side and once that cheese starts to come out this is very important let it pool on the pan please you're gonna get little crispy edges of cheese and it's gonna get brown flipping boom look at this you got the crisp cheese on the outside nice brownie and crust on the corn tortilla repeat on the other side once that's done heat goes off take it out of the pan boom onto a plate beautiful short rib taco you've got the cheese crust it smells luxurious and more importantly a little bit charred tomatillo serrano salsa it's acidic it's spicy got that anxiousness but it's also very refreshing goes in the salsa lovely i hate to say this with the mood that i'm in right now this is appeasing to my my pleasures more than that beautiful glazed one it's something you can eat on the go but more specifically it's easy to make so if you have a bunch of this left over you just shred it put it together a little bit of cheese dip it in that salsa and you're gonna have a very beautiful time now let's move on to one more next one's gonna be a short rib sandwich mayo about one cup wee bit of lemon juice two cloves of garlic grated see the advantage of grating garlic you get a little bit of garlic in every bite mix that a bit of pepper a touch of salt mix that all in and it's sort of like an acidic lemon garlic pepper mayo wow thanks to movie magic beautifully caramelized onions hope that happened i don't know medium heat a little bit of butter in here just to coat the pan cutting board beautiful loaf of bread you'll notice that i like to slice my own bread josh oh it's an extra step okay it costs you like a couple of seconds for dramatically more exciting slices i want like a nice thick piece of bread that's thick now on the inside you're gonna go really light with this sauce you don't need a lot of it it's very strong spread that disperse your butter first slice down mayo side up so this is gonna act as an adhesive we're gonna put just a couple slices of swiss okay while that's toasting speed this up a little bit okay cheese is melted a little bit of our caramelized onion spread that nicely we want a lot okay we're gonna add our beef this is really really really rich so keep it keep it thin you can make more sandwiches with less do a couple more slices of cheese and boom okay that's on there then to that melt that down got our top slice on okay and let me give this a little flip so toast the other side i mean come on look at this i'm gonna let this toast for just a couple more minutes and then we'll taste it this is a sandwich you know what this needs this needs a little thing of broth this is a dope french dip swiss cheese beef the caramelized onion help balancing all that honestly surprisingly balanced sandwich not too rich with all that fat 10 and a tan would make again moral of the story is it doesn't end at the 72 hour mark you can do a million other things with it afterwards and that shows the complexity of cuisine food and the world around us but you want to know what else shows the world around us b-roll [Music] [Music] you

[Applause] [Music] so today we are making the one and only snickers bar it's sort of like a three musketeers but with actual texture sorry kendrick this candy bar is far more simple than people realize it's literally just a layer of nougat a layer of peanut caramel with peanuts you make a bar and you put it in the chocolate and there you go should be that easy right well let's find out and make this shall we yeah whoa greens charles r walgreen bought out his employer and set up his own this is really just boring oh yeah the three-point uh so first appearance single-handedly one of the ugliest buildings we've ever walked into one out of ten there's no menu so we can't vote that i want to give a real rating but like what am i supposed to say there's no menu i'll give it a 5 out of 10 because there's a lot of stuff that you can get at walgreens and then the last thing is customer service you're about to find out damn it says satisfies but it's only this long does this satisfy let us know in the comments all right we've got the four and a half inch satisfier i'm gonna give the customer service 10 out of 10. super nice very easy now let's go satisfy someone we got the stick with a snickers bar you have the vein we will talk about that another day i'm glad they're removing the vein this is terrible eat up enjoy the bumpy ride in your mouth i do like snickers for the record i'm actually a fan chocolate trash but it's supposed to be got a good texture three things i like it i like snickers sorry second thing anyone ever get that spicy note there's like a burning in the back of your throat whenever you eat one of these i don't know why probably not a good sign but hey it's there third thing it's actually quite balanced this could be a challenge or maybe not this isn't complicated but having good technique will probably make this a lot easier three elements caramel with my nuts peanuts i mean nougat very basic and you guessed it so caramel with the nuts get a 9x13 baking pan lightly grease it with spray oil then line with parchment grease that very lightly as well in a medium saucepan add one and a half cups or 330 grams of granulated sugar half a cup or 120 milliliters of water three and a half tablespoons or 80 grams of light corn syrup give it a light mix then heat over medium put the sugars begin to dissolve then crank it to medium-high and let that come to a boil now i do want to point out that most people's cooking equipment is gonna heat this extremely unevenly or your pan's unevenly heated whatever so you're gonna have little splotches of amber you need to swirl it you can but only winter is to get to that point once it turns to a nice amber color immediately whisk in 2 3 of a cup or 160 milliliters of heavy whipping cream fall by half a teaspoon or 3 grams of fine sea salt now once it's emulsified and luscious add 2 cups or 280 grams of salted and roasted peanuts now mix together and pour that into your prepared pan let it sit until room temp about 20 to 25 minutes next nougat which needs to be made after the caramel is cooled this technique is similar to zeef clench nougats that you'll see in these ridiculously cute farmers markets in the southern regions of france like avignon you need a stand mixer with this sorry pal don't try and get funny because your arm will fall off from whisking so first in a stand mixer bowl add two room temperature eggs pop that on your stand mixer with the whisk attachment and begin beating on medium high and while that's going get a medium saucepan and add one cup 225 grams of granulated sugar in a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of water a quarter cup or 75 grams of light corn syrup three quarters of a cup for 220 grams of honey give that a very light stir heat over medium until half dissolved then increase the heat to medium high bring them to a nice boil and let it rip until the sugar mixture reaches 300 degrees fahrenheit exactly while you're beating those eggs go ahead and add three tablespoons or 32 grams of granulated sugar in batches until all of it's been added if your egg whites are having trouble you can add a little pinch of cream of once your mixture is at room temp and you have thick stiff glossy peaks keep that beating on medium high and add your hot syrup to the running stand mixer by streaming it down the side of the stand mixer bowl continue streaming that until all the syrup has been added then just fix that bad boy for an additional two to three minutes or until it starts to stiffen up and cool down a good bit then beat in the beans from one vanilla bean to evenly incorporated like a got dang pig and mud brother and that is your nougat pour that on top of your cold peanut caramel and spread it evenly to coat the pan listen carefully please let this cool to room temp before refrigerating unless you want to steam and get all messed up so about 30 to 45 minutes then cover with plastic and pop it in the fridge overnight to firm up now next day pull it out of the fridge pop it out of the container onto a cutting board and cut that into well snicker-shaped bars you can make them short you can make them long giving them to square bites it's up to you that's the beauty here next get yourself one pound or 450 grams of good quality chocolate ideally around 60 cow and well you need to melt it look i chose not to temper this one because well snickers doesn't temper theirs so right that that's a good idea right wrong terrible idea definitely temperate if you want to look much nicer more glossy and well just good and i do have a guide for an easy temper method which the link is in the description for that anyway take your bars dip them into chocolate to fully coat remove carefully with two forks let it drain slightly and place on the greatest silpat of all time don't forget to add the quintessential pulsating vein and repeat with the rest of these bad boys now you could totally add some flaky salt but you'd be missing out on the view of that beautiful vein and then just let those cool to room temperature until hardened and beautiful trim the edges all the way around so it's a nice little rectangular uh bar and now let's see how we did a bonjour kendrick there may be something here for you not much there huh somehow this tastes completely different i don't know if i can say that this is better although this looks the same feels the same it's even got the vein and a real looking one this tastes nothing like a snickers instead what it tastes like is some nice confection you get it at a little french pastry shop they got little chocolates you pop it out oh that's good i don't know what to do about that hey buddy how's it going good sir number one number two finish chewing dog two so give me your thoughts i completely disagree i think that version was better obviously but i still think it tastes like snickers it feels like what it should be without adding a bunch of extra stuff in it and just focusing on the actual ingredients that you have so like the dark chocolate the peanuts the caramel and whatever was in the middle i agree with you i think that they add something else to accentuate the peanut flavor i think they're adding peanut butter to the nougat and they're adding more salt so if you want it to match snickers flavor you need saltier caramel we'll increase the salt in the

Get My Cookbook: http://bit.l...",2022-11-29 21:59:44.385768, everybody loves a rice bowl so we're putting arguably the two best head to head [Music] okay so today is japanese versus korean rice bowl two cuisines that i have so much love for they share some similarities but there's also vast differences not only in the ingredients but the flavors the way they're combined the way that they're enjoyed this isn't just about oh one is better than the other this is more so what do i like more what do i think the masses are gonna like more what do i think that the masses are gonna wanna try first so with all that being said let's make this shall we before we get to spanking these bowls out first we begin with rice you need two cups of dry medium or short grain rice for either of these two recipes wash your rice till the water runs clear drain it then into a rice cooker because you respect your rice cover with equal parts water run that damn thing rice now once you have rice it's mostly about toppings let's begin with the japanese rice bowl katsudon which is a type of danbury first let's make a quick dashi get a small sauce pot add half a cup or 120 milliliters of water a one inch square of kombu three tablespoons or two grams of bonito flakes heat that just until it reaches a steamy heat turn off the heat and let it sit for 15 minutes then straighten all that out and reserve the liquid next katsu you need two boneless pork chops around one inch thick pound those out until they're about a half inch thick and then you need that classic katsu three bowl setup three quarters of a cup are 40 grams of panko bread crumbs another one with one cup or 150 grams of all-purpose flour in the last one with one egg and one tablespoon or 15 grams of water whisked together now first season your pork chops generously with salt on both sides and then the bread first coat it in the flour thoroughly shake off the excess then dip into the egg mixture until fully coated without dry spots because each dry spot is a kick in the shin from peppa then finally dip that into the panko to coat each and every crevice pressing to adhere repeat that with all your chops place on your shoe tree to the side and well you're ready to fry in a heavy bottom pot filled about halfway with vegetable oil heat that to 350 fahrenheit and fry your pork chops two at a time for four to six minutes or until beautifully crisp and golden brown and once that's beautifully crisp golden brown and the internal temperature is around 155 to 160 fahrenheit it's done yes that's closer to medium you can cook pork to medium please relax now drain this on a wire rack and immediately season generously with salted taste and a light sprinkle of shimmy togarashi all right we're almost there get a non-stick pan set it over medium heat add just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan once hot add half a yellow onion sliced season your taste with salt and saute for one minute cover with a lid and cook stirring occasionally until just softened about two to three more minutes then after dashi you just made one tablespoon or 15 grams of mirin two half tablespoons or 35 grams of shiradashi which is different and you can buy at most asian stores but feel free to omit one tablespoon or 12 grams of sake and 1 tablespoon or 15 grams of soy sauce give that a little stir bring that to a boil and let it reduce that mixture by half about 3 minutes while that's still simmering quickly slice your katsu into half inch thick slices add them to your simmering pan be two whole eggs together and pour that mixture all over your pan and lightly coating your katsu here and there top it with the lid and let that cook for one to two more minutes or just until your egg is cooked we want a tender but not like a rubber band now i know this technique seems odd we just spent all this time getting the catsuit crispy what are we doing josh look although it seems wrong it creates a brand new texture you wouldn't have any other way the cat sedan is done obviously goes on rice but before we assemble let's move on to the classic korean bb bop you got pork belly mushrooms garlic spinach pickled carrots spicy cucumbers so for the pork belly get a medium-sized bowl and add two tablespoons or 45 grams of gochujang one tablespoon and 21 grams of honey one tablespoon or 15 grams of soy sauce whisk in one tablespoon or 15 grams of rice vinegar then once combined stir in one finely chopped green onion now you'll need two pounds or 900 grams of raw skinless pork belly cut that into three inch rectangles then slice that bad boy into half inch thick planks like these bad boys add that to your marinade let it sit at room temp for 15 minutes then pop onto a wire rack instead of hershey tray and into an oven that's been preheated to 400 degrees fahrenheit for 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked through crisp and lightly charred to perfection set that to the side and keep it warm next pickled carrots you need three large carrots which are ideally nice and girthy julienne those bad boys place them in a one quart heat proof container then a medium saucepan add 1 tablespoon or 18 grams of salt 1 tablespoon or 13 grams of granulated sugar 1 cup or 240 milliliters of water 1 cup or 240 milliliters of rice vinegar and 1 red fresno finely diced crank the heat to medium high and as soon as it comes to a boil cut off the heat and pour your hot liquid over your carrots to submerge completely then all you have to do is let it sit at room temp until room temp and you've got pickles wow good work next up mommy's mushrooms 2 tablespoons are 28 grams of vegetable oil in a 12-inch non-stick skillet set over medium heat once that's hot at half a pound or 227 grams of fresh sliced shiitake mushrooms cook those stirring often and once those are cooked through and starting to pick up some color about four minutes cut off the heat and add in one tablespoon or 15 grams of soy sauce that's it next garlic spinach medium saucepan heat over medium add 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of vegetable oil and 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of toasted sesame oil once that's hot add 3 cups or 52 grams of fresh spinach optionally add a light sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds season your taste with salt cook stirring often until the spinach is wilted then cut off the heat and finish with seven cloves of very finely chopped garlic yeah seven okay stir to incorporate and that's your spinach okay we're on our last thing spicy cucumbers now first slice one large seedless english cucumber about a quarter of an inch thick mandolin recommended but at the risk of your own fingy wingy tips add those to a bowl season generously with salt and let that sit for 10 minutes to dry out the wawa then drain the excess wawa rinse with fresh wawa and drain one more time get a small saucepan add four tablespoons of 56 grams of vegetable oil heat the 300 fahrenheit and then immediately cut the heat then in a separate bowl one green onion finely chopped two teaspoons or six grams of gochugaru two teaspoons or six grams of toasted sesame seeds three cloves of garlic finely chopped one tablespoon or 15 grams of soy sauce 2 teaspoons or 10 grams of rice vinegar 1 teaspoon or 5 grams of msg mixed together until combined and this is the moment of truth stir in your hot oil and let it sit for five minutes now add your cukes and toss till coated and these go so hard you'll be happy to make these completely on their own brother okay we're ready to put these together first the katsudon get a large bowl fill it with rice followed by half your katsudon a nice layer of green onion and well actually that's it bibimbap is a little more involved again bowl place the rice down i like to pat it down to create almost like a little table for your ingredients to be laid on first layer is optional but frequently used which is a nice runny fried egg followed by a few slices of your pork belly then your cucumbers pickled carrots mushrooms and last but not least your garlic spinach side by side we have two very different bowls the bb bop definitely looks a little bit more exciting because you know you got all these colors textures but truly i love them both there's only one way to determine this the taste test a little bit of bibimbap sauce bibimbap katsudon first i know what everyone's asking what about it being soggy if you make katsudon right it should still have a little bit of crisp on the top a little bit soggy on the bottom that's the point this is beauty and simplicity let's try this one so puncture the egg mix it around into the rice a little bit of that if you want the sauce recipe it's in a separate video hey kendrick you don't have your glasses on your uh helmet on you know what i mean don't eat the headphones for that you can hear that from down the road if you're working with chopsticks and you got a big piece of meat good idea to have some scissors off the side my left hand is not my dominant hand as you can see a little bit of mushroom a little bit of spinach a little bit of rice i don't know how i can pick one let me consult the culinary gods okay i have my answer the one that i would pick more times over would be this one they're both undeniably delicious and both i would be happy with but i would choose this more often because it's simpler to make but not less complex in flavor and that's what i love about it there's texture flavor in this but don't get me wrong if you want more layering and you want more flavors then this is your answer but at the end of the day the choice is yours so beauty and simplicity you know want to know what else is beauty and simplicity b-roll [Music] you

think it should cost something more like this that is butt cheaper [Music] so a gourmet nacho experience is gonna cost you all right you want all the fixins you want the meat and the avocado and the sour cream and onions and charred corn and nacho cheese but real nacho cheese made with like a like a mornay sauce it's gonna cost you buddy this isn't your 7-eleven neon cheese and literally nothing else and you're farting for days you might still be farting from this but an experience always costs you unless you make it properly like we do here so with that being said let's make this shall we throwing pre-shredded cheese and a bunch of old chips and slamming that into the oven is not okay so instead let's make this simpler no oven needed just a stove top and it doesn't even need to be gas now let's begin with our buff topping to make this cheaper i'm cutting the beef with mushrooms which will add a similar both like flavor and a nice and moist and juicy texture to the whole dish now get yourself half a pound or 227 grams of cremini mushrooms and chop them extremely fine with a knife think mints now to a 12 inch pan add a splash of vegetable oil just to go at the bottom set over medium high then once hot add all your mushrooms and let those cook stirring often for about three to four minutes or until most of their moisture has evaporated and they're starting to pick up some nice color season a taste of salt stir them and scoop those to the side add a touch more oil if needed then add half a pound or 227 grams of ground beef ideally something around 70 to 80 lean the fattier the better now press that out so it gets a full contact sear hit with some salt to taste let that sieve for two minutes flip wow like some sort of weird burger patty hit again with salt and peppy to taste sear two more minutes and then chop that up with a spatula or more effectively with the potato masher until a decently fine crumble now once it's fully cooked and getting a little whippy add one can of chipotle peppers in adobo press out just the juices through a fine mesh strainer and reserve the solids for uh not this blend it into a marinade or something be creative now stir that in then add a pinch of ground cumin optionally stir that in then add three cloves of roughly chopped garlic to the beef mix it in and once it's crisp to your liking it is done now let's talk chips you really think papa is gonna have you buy chips come on now the good stuff's gonna be expensive and you wield the unbelievable power of the spatula my friends all you need is a big bag of corn tortillas cut them into six like this boom in half boom then in thirds and another in thirds you get the idea get a pot filled with just about one and a half quarts or one and a half liters of vegetable oil heat the 350 fahrenheit and add your chips in batches to avoid overcrowding and fry for two to three minutes tossing occasionally until the bubbling subsides and they start to pick up just a tiny bit of toasty color then fish them out enter it in a wire rack and immediately season with salt to taste while they're still hot i keep telling you enough to season them when they're cold because the salt won't stick anyway repeat with all your tortillas and just like that you have chips now your house smells like fresh tortilla chips your neighbors family roommates whoever it is is probably going to thank you and if they don't well then don't give them any of your nachos and tell them i said that they can eat yeah nacho sauce time which is really just trashy morning so let's make this quick and simple medium saucepan add 1.5 tablespoons to 21 grams of unsalted butter boom medium heat bang it's melted wow then i have one half tablespoons or 15 grams of all-purpose flour whisk it together and let that cook while stirring often for about 30 to 40 seconds then whisk in one cup or 240 milliliters of whole milk then once it starts to thicken whisk in the following spices if you have them but guess what they're optional one teaspoon or three grams of paprika half a teaspoon or 2 grams of ground cumin and 1 teaspoon or 3 grams of garlic powder whisk that together then whisk in half a cup or 36 grams of grated american cheese and 1 cup or 72 grams of grated cheddar cheese keep on whisking until smooth and glossy now look it might be a little too thick totally fine add a splash or two of milk until it gets that nice season with salt and pepper to taste if needed and you got that it's time for toppers basic simple guac one large javo dice mash with a fork that's salt and lime juice to taste mash beautiful half a red onion thinly slice washed with water to remove the aggressive bite of the onion but retain its sweetness and improve its texture four ounces or 113 grams of cherry tomatoes medium saucepan touch of oil medium high tilt very very wow hot my thingy winky hot add them to the pan sear for two minutes swirling occasionally just until they blister and soften lightly one ear of corn charred lightly over an open flame turn on occasion for about a minute remove the kernels and fantastique now i symbol my nachos more like lasagna look you want a piece of something in every bite don't be lazy like too many restaurants and just throw everything on top so that when you finish the good stuff there's only bald ass chips left on the bottom depending on if you do multiple servings or not decide on the full amount of chips that you're gonna use take half that amount put that on the plate or tray follow that with your beef to your heart's desire a nice drizzle of your nacho cheese some of your cherry tomatoes scattered nicely a little bit of that there corn fresh red onion some thinly sliced serrano chilies which you should only need two of them for this whole recipe cilantro leaves for garnish and then boom add your second half of your chips and guess what do it again pal this time starting with the nacho cheese you know we did the nacho cheese differently on the first layer to act as an adhesive but this one is for aesthetic after the cheese more of your beef your cherry tomatoes corn red onion beautifully your serranos a light dollop of sour cream and your guacamole and finally finish with more cilantro if desired albeit optional then it has to be one of the most towering non-economical looking nachos now look this tray was a good 75 of the ingredients that we had but not many are gonna eat this whole dang tray and usually calculate these prices based off the servings so if you were to serve this over a few different plates per person then it comes up to this price right here but if you're gonna make this whole full tray in one big go well then it's this price right here but did we beat the restaurant quality version well the answer is hopefully yes so let's taste test that's a big nacho vicar and kendrick pointed something out you see the beauty of this is i actually layered the nachos like a lasagna why is that you ever order nachos and they just put everything on top and then by the time you've eaten all that there's just chips left don't do that to people we deserve respect this is respect and for this price right here i mean do you really need me to describe to you how to eat nachos nachos are a diy choose your own adventure do whatever you want get a little bit of dip a little bit of this and that there's cheese on a piece of cheese not on a pizza there's something can we get up here into the future in this portal right here breaking news president weissman declares nachos the national food this is a deluxe nacho with all the flavors all the textures i could possibly want and more it feels gourmet feels gastronomic it feels like i'm at a nice restaurant that happens to serve nachos may not be michelin starred but serves really good nachos and for none of that  pricing what more could you possibly want because i know what you want you want b-roll [Music] [Music]

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so as i said i'm a big fan of the girl scouts huge advocate love it we've all heard the stories of the cookies i've had them a couple times when i was a kid i don't remember what they taste like or what they're like so this will be a learning experience for the both of us for the record this has nothing negative to say about the girl scouts i am putting their cookies under slight scrutiny because i feel like they're a little over inflated a little but we're gonna get all right i'll be right back oh my god a girl scout wow look at that with some cookies dog aren't you a little old to be a girl scout hey don't judge me all right it's hard out here the hustle never stops what do you want samoas peanut butter thin mints i have it all i'll do

right i'll be right i'll be right back right now hurry up so we've got the box wow they're stoked on this roller coaster thing it's great so far this is the best container we've had on the show okay we open it up these are my favorite uh girl scout cookies fun fact [Music] these are good these are built perfectly to eat a thousand of them whatever the cookie bases i don't really detect the biggest issue with this is the chocolate and the caramel caramel you can't really taste it's just kind of like sweet and the chocolate that being said i am a fan of these that's not gonna stop me from making them better please don't hurt me girl scouts please right this is surprisingly easy very basic elements a crunchy shortbread cookie toasted coconut caramel and chocolate sounds easy enough but you need to do it properly with the salted butter shortbread get a medium-sized bowl add two cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour and whisk in half a teaspoon or five grams of fine sea salt in a separate medium sized bowl add 1 cup 225 grams of softened salted butter with a handheld electric mixer begin beating that till evenly distributed in the bowl then while beating on medium speed add in three quarters of a cup or 167 grams of white granulated sugar just a little splash at a time until all of it has been added then beat until beautifully creamed follow that up by beating in one egg white mix tilt thoroughly incorporated and finish that off with three quarters of a teaspoon or four grams of vanilla extract beat that in and half a teaspoon or two grams of almond extract again beat tilt thoroughly combined then add your flour mix in three to four parts beat until incorporated each time and you'll be left with a beautiful smooth and fluid dough now divide that into two even pieces place between two sheets of parchment paper roll that out until you get a sheet that's about a quarter inch thick place that onto a sheet tray and repeat with the other piece of dough and place those both into the fridge overnight to firm an age with flava this process is crucial okay if you want your cookies to retain their shape and maximize their flavor do this thanks to movie magic it's the next day wow thank you editor love you so much preheat your oven to 350 fahrenheit then using a two and a half inch donut cutter like this link in the description for that then punch out as many donut shaped rings as you can from your dough placing those rings onto parchment-lined baking sheets space about three-quarters of an inch apart you'll need two sheet trays for this so if you only have one maybe go to the store now pop that into your preheated 350 oven for 15 to 18 minutes or until you get a lovely light golden brown cookie let that cool slightly and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely now moving on to your coconut you really want to be careful toasting this so get yourself two and a half cups or 175 grams of unsweetened shredded coconut place that into your preheated 350 fahrenheit oven for about three to six minutes stirring often until a beautiful golden brown and toasted as much as possible be aware this burns faster than getting slapped by your mama by saying too many bad words then once that's done remove it place it on another sheet tray see that second tray is coming in handy to cool completely now while that's cooling let's make our [Music] in a medium massage spot add one cup or 208 grams of white granulated sugar a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of water two and a half tablespoons or 54 grams of light corn syrup lightly mix that together and set over medium-high let the dissolve and come to a boil and once boiling let it cook swirling only if absolutely necessary until your sugar begins to turn to an amber color then whisk in four and a half tablespoons or 64 grams of cold unsalted butter that's been cut into pieces then once melted and emulsified whisk in half a cup or 120 milliliters of heavy whipping cream whisk together the top of mine cut off the heat then add half a teaspoon or four grams of fine sea salt and two teaspoons or 13 grams of vanilla bean paste which you can totally use vanilla extract relax pour that into a separate container and cool to room temp now before assembly get a large bowl add all your coconut followed by three quarters of your caramel tossed together so you get a big stinky mess like that spread the remaining quarter of your remaining caramel evenly under the tops of all your cookies just like this you have to do that in order to act as a sort of glue to keep the cacanat on top now mount your coconut on top of the rings nice and evenly to cover the entire ring it's pretty basic repeat that with all your cookies and those are some sticky rings i'll tell you what now last but not least melted chocolate which you can just throw in a pot or a microwave no big deal i get it the chocolate doesn't need to be perfectly tempered although if you want an easy way i've got you start with 12 ounces or 340 grams of dark chocolate around 60 cacao rough chop that bad boy vacuum seal it in a nice quality backpack drop that into a 115 degree sous vide bath sit for seven minutes squishing together after being melted then drop your soothing temperature to 81 fahrenheit you can always add cold water to do that quickly then drop your bag back in and let it sit for seven more minutes knead it a little bit and boom chocolate is melted and sort of tempered now stick the edge and pour out three quarters of your chocolate into a medium sized bowl leaving the rest of the bag to drizzle on afterwards now take a cookie dunk just the bottom half into the chocolate leaving the coconut exposed then carefully fish out with a fork let it drain nicely then place in the most beautiful and only silpat that money could ever buy now repeat with all of your wee cookies then once they're all done drizzle on a thin zigzag layer of your chocolate on top you know that nice fine dress and let this solidify at room temp and you have a cookie that looks almost otherworldly like a ring for some other beautifully chocolatey planet we could talk about it all day but let's decide our winner batting down the hatches girl scouts alright we're coming for you look at this first off this is what i would really want this cookie to be size-wise one or two of these and you're good [Music] it's over is this better a thousand percent absolutely you got that buttery sweet delicious caramel you can taste each and every little level the chocolate's nice and that cookie base has the perfect amount of crunch i mean look at this it's got that little crumble but it's nice though it melts in your mouth it immediately snaps and eviscerates into a beautiful creamy liquidy cookie hey buddy yo what's up good sir all right number one all right number two number one was on a just a completely different level it was not only a texture thing using dark chocolate added so much more that

diner which is nice and all but you could have it for this right here that is but cheaper [Music] so when you're going to go get an omelette right nobody just orders an omelette you got to get the whole spread omelette hash browns toast maybe some vegetable or fruit or whatever maybe a little mimosa you're at like 20 20 maybe more and most of the time it's pretty mediocre making an omelette is simple and it's cheap so you should be doing it at home and making one of the greatest breakfast combos of your life so let's make this shall we boom breakfast sausage omelet bang that price texas toast bing bang that price potato hash donkey that price before we get to the omelette let's talk potato hash first peel three large russet potatoes diced it into half inch cubes and i say this all the time please keep your knife cuts even to a 12-inch non-stick skillet add three tablespoons or 30 grams of vegetable oil heat that over medium-high swirling that they're panned once that's hot add in your taters toss the coat thoroughly in the oil let that sear for about five minutes flip them as best you can to reveal those crispy season the taste with salt sear another five minutes then reduce the heat to medium add one diced yellow onion season again with salt and let those cook and sweat tossing occasionally until the onions turn translucent and the potato is cooked through about four to eight more minutes that's done and at this point you can season them with the spice mix if desired or adjust salt levels as needed moving on to tomatoes quite literally hot nonstick pan enough oil to cook the bottom it's medium high heat cut 4 roma tomatoes in half dab any excess off of them and then add all your tomatoes into the pan cut side down and sear for three to four minutes or until flipped to reveal a beautifully lightly charred tomato see the other side for one minute and that's your roasty tomato to accompany your taters season them lightly with salt and we're just taking a light note from the english breakfast okay how do we make this omelet cheap uh not by buying expensive breakfast sausage and look josh it's not reasonable to have a meat grinder in a butt cheaper but i really wanted this to be fresh ground so i found a solution a knife and a cutting board it's not that crazy okay it takes six to eight minutes of manual labor but it's easy you'll need one pound or 450 grams of boneless pork boston but slice it into thin slices and then essentially from there dice your meat into small pieces then with the edge of your knife whack it over and over and over being careful here then fold it over itself whack it some more and just keep running your knife through folding it over itself on occasion until you have a relatively nice ground pork you know what's crazy this might be one of the tastiest ground pork that we've ever made simply because of the way the fat is dispersed pop it into a medium sized bowl and knead it for a few seconds to get it lightly emulsified then add two teaspoons or six grams of garlic powder one teaspoon or two grams of cayenne one teaspoon or two grams of fennel powder 1 teaspoon or 2 grams of dried thyme 2 teaspoons or 10 grams of fine sea salt mix till combined and look at that breakfast sausage completely by hand now get a 12 inch skillet over medium high heat lightly grease it if necessary then spread all of your breakfast sausage across the entire surface let that sear for two to three minutes flip and sear for one more minute then using either a wooden spoon or ideally a potato masher break that up into pieces as small as you can then just let that bad boy cook stirring often for three to four minutes or until cooked through with nice little crispy bits beautifully dispersed then add one poblano pepper that's optionally been charred completely over an open flame the char then rubbed off and finely diced followed by half a sweet onion thinly sliced stir together and allow that to sweat together just until the vegetables are softened about four to five minutes then just keep that covered and warm you like regular toast surely it could be better yeah if it's [Music] get a loaf of white bread ideally if you can get unsliced then do that because i prefer mine sliced about 1 inch thick if your toaster can't handle my thickness i don't know what to tell you before toasting melt down three tablespoons or 42 grams of unsalted butter over medium heat once fully melted cut the heat add in two cloves of finely chopped garlic and two tablespoons or four grams of very finely chopped parsley mix that bad boy together now toast your bread on both sides either in a pan with butter or in a toaster then once toasted in hot brush it generously with your garlic butter then slice it in half at a diagonal for maximum efficiency and that's how you'll serve it okay my children first combine 1 cup or 60 grams of fine grated monterey jack and 1 cup or 60 grams of fine grated cheddar toss together and set to the side for your eggs get a medium-sized bowl and crack in 12 whole lovely big boy eggs optionally add a splash of milk season in a taste with salt and whisk together until homogenized now heat a 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat and add in one tablespoon of unsalted butter or vegetable oil to the pan just enough to coat the bottom once that's hot and bubbling then just pour in a nice ladle full which is about three quarters of a cup of your eggs let that spread across the pan now as the egg cooks simply bring in some of the uncooked egg from the edge towards the center and then tilt the pan in the direction of that pole so the eggs fill up that bit that you just exposed then repeat that process all the way around the edge of the pan till your eggs are about 90 of the way cooked through now working quickly add a nice handful of cheese to one side a decent big spoonful of your breakfast sausage mix maybe a little more cheese why not then once the omelet is just barely stiff enough to fold well fold it don't be shy then once that's done let it sit on one side of your pan to lightly toast the eggs and melt the cheese then remove it from the heat grab a plate hold your pan overhanded like you see here give it a nice flip and woo i'm feeling like i'm out in the country good lord to finish this plate get a nice half piece of your texas toast followed by your potato hash one bruleed tomato and maybe some extra fine chopped parsley on the potatoes for some color why not now this is an omelette breakfast for only the greatest in the land let us taste test wow for this price right here that's very nice you got a little extra in your budget well guess what [Music] a beautiful birmosa little bit of beer a little bit of orange juice and there you go it's like a mimosa but significantly less classy but it tastes good kind of like a shandy omelet a little cheesy [Applause] that's where that goes and that's really good and you thought you couldn't have ground me how about go to work go to work with your arm it's good for you the omelette's a 10 out of 10 i'm not gonna go any other route than that it's exactly what i want in an omelette a little bit of toast texas toast if you will wee bit of omelette on the toast a little bit of tomato potato you guys feel that this is a perfect omelet breakfast meal for the cheapest price you could ever possibly have with a little bit of sweat and tears for all your guests will be worth it but you want to know what else is worth it b-roll [Music] so [Music] you

Get My...",2022-11-29 21:59:44.385768, this has been a long time coming and now we're putting you to the test [Music] today we're making pad thai traditional asian noodle dish nice to meet you joshua i see you still keeping your goatee your fiancee never tell you to shave that off hi okay we get my goatee but you've judged many of my videos in the past culture perfection uncle roger will call him uncle joshua however most recently the green curry debacle snow pea no but what he doing so much pain in my heart beero so cool for what uncle roger take his uncle tito away i feel it it hurt remind me of jamie oliver green curry we joke no no well that's why we're here today i've lost my uncle status i thought i made a green curry i wish you could have tried it but i also understand where you're coming from i think you made points that were accurate the goal here is we're gonna be cooking side by side at the same time bring our dishes together and see if you can bring it to a level that is equal or better than mine uncle roger usually i just talk on my channel i don't really cook but we see how it goes you lose to me then that very bad i just committed don't get up joshua why you bring me to this jungle to cook yeah the van's over there in case i lose oh you mean that pedophile went don't bring uncle roger in there remind me of my childhood there is a wager here if i win or we at least meet in the middle if you're so gracious to give me my uncle title back i would love for that to happen if you win and i lose or somewhere in the middle then i will host you and aunty esther a multi-day private dinner event anti-esta my favorite chef leo what about me you like number 15 on my list echo like auntie esther gordon ramsay my mom my grandma bobby flay my high school cafeteria auntie okay that being said the new element of surprise might just make me number one gentlemen please bring in the curtain curtain this isn't just about the final dish this is about seeing how well you do along the way how can you keep up what's your technique like can you keep it consistent can you keep your composure what's that gonna look like that's what this challenge is about so with that being said let's begin so to begin with very basic knife work so get your shallots cut the tops off and then you're going to slice them in half lengthwise two little halves you're going to slice them nice and thin cut so fast for what relax joshua there's something to be won here i think he's just doing this i can do that too don't show uh shall it's done wait wait wait uncle watcher oh now need more time how old are you uncle roger 51 year old oh my gosh yeah how old are you 26. you need to moisturize your face because you look like when do you think the hearing aid age is gonna start to step in maybe tomorrow because you're chopping too loud finish chopping one one yeah you keep talking to me keep distracting me on the garlic slice those thin now we have two different containers of garlic i don't know if you noticed that so that's intentional you just like using all these empty containers i feel bad for your cleaner usually people just get dishwasher but your dishwasher is actual human for southeast asian cooking always use shallots onion for poor people all right second container of garlic we're gonna smash those chop smash garlic and chop good good technique all right veg done uncle watch your own now i got i tried this in every bone wait wait wait done oh oh okay garlic chives chives correct yeah yes i knew it you're gonna see these sort of crunchy hard thicker bottoms slice off they're a little too crunchy toss them to the side you don't need them we can use them for something else now the chives themselves they're gonna get cut into one inch segments one inch segment okay this is what ankara to think one inch is as guy we always inflate correct definitely this strong pano is nodding that's definitely an itch hello antis all right next bit we have zakai pickled radish right you're gonna dump that out this is sometimes used but it's optional but it could if you have it so we're just gonna chop this really fine you can just run your knife through it there's no oh oh you're moving a little bit fast huh yeah i have to keep up with you you're too fast now sometimes you want slow and sensual your girlfriend never will tell you that i can go slow want some rmp chopping the thing i like about this pickle a little bit acidic a little bit salty sometimes the spicy depending on which one you get if you have randomized bits some are a little big some are a little small every so often you'll get a big bite of pickle acidic splash that helps kind of break up the taste the texture of pad thai how do you feel about cooking outdoors uncle roger love it outdoor kitchen very authentic in asia we do it all the time cook inside your whole house gonna smell like shrimp paste uncle roger watch so many true crime documentaries they don't even know and someone have cops in there but the moment you fry shrimp paste your neighbor no and they call police so next we make the pad thai sauce fish sauce tamarind paste palm sugar but more specifically with tamarind you get this sort of block that's a problem put that in your metal bowl and to that you're going to add all of that hot water for what asian people we just used chopsticks so you're just going to kind of mash it up you can use half of that water or all of that water i'm starting with half you should say earlier i got to pot the whole thing you just kind of break that down mix and hydrate will start to thicken a little bit this is what makes the basis of the flavor of pad thai nice and mixed together not yet not yet well you can't pre-prepare this for me i wanted you to do it you know i want dishwasher just then think that remind me of my ex-wife take my money just enter maybe using whisk is good idea after all i knew it sauce is done we're just gonna strain that to get those little seeds out of there because nobody wants to chip a tooth i chipped my tooth last week i'm not doing it again you're too so weak so we half of that palm sugar in three tablespoons just use fili i feel that i'm going to use this much fish sauce fish sugar and fish sauce correct salty sweetness complement the sourness well come on more palm sugar okay so that's our sauce good good we're ready to slice our chicken so we have chicken breast chicken breast hi why it's so dry why not chicken thai joshua we almost always exclusively used chicken thigh i don't know why we went with breast today it felt right that was obviously wrong but we're gonna make it good it's all about technique so chicken goes down we're gonna slice it thin you know and when i say thin i mean not too thin a quarter inch thick if you go too thick it won't get cooked fast enough go too thin well then it's gonna get overcooked i'm going to think this too much chicken so i'm gonna just cook half of it later too much i like the noodle more if too much protein sometimes it's a very western thing look roger you're pretty jacked don't you think you want more protein well gotcha you want protein just drink protein shake food's supposed to be for enjoyment not for protein that's fair what about a big steak stick is one of the most boring food on the planet so boring it just slapped off meat salt and pepper uncle roger prefer korean barbecue you barbecue the thin sliced beef mmm bulgogi and you like steak joshua you like steak pecan we have all of our meats and plus chicken's been chopped vegetables been prepped sauce has been made all we have to do stir-fry put it together make sure it's done properly with our walk and wok set up nice i like you have walked and the wok is nice and seasoned good job josh rock god damn if your walk burner isn't hissing not missing you ain't got the right walk burner you need to meet them you should meet them i think they're trying to me up you have a bottle of oil we're just about two tablespoons whatever feels good to you use feely roll the oil i don't know what he's doing over there i don't know why why are you stirring it already spreading the oil where did you learn that don't know so we're gonna carefully add in our chicken a little bit at a time i like to try and get it to flatten on the side so get some nice color going in we're sizzling we're just gonna add tiny bit of kosher salt just to get the chicken salty not super traditional i doubt uncle roger will do the same okay so we're starting to get some color crank the heat up flip your chicken up so now i'm going to stir fry it give it a little bit of a toss spread it out oh yeah now we're cooking you know this is where chicken thigh would have been a better option yeah i should have listened to him oh toasted chicken put that in your empty bowl just kind of scrape it in there fill it up just a bit more i'm adding all my shrimp powder you're gonna want to move pretty fast here i'm lowering the heat just a little and then adding my shrimp and i'm stir frying the shrimp foaming it's toasting looking beautiful shrimp powder correct good shrimp powder yes sir next we have our shallots four cloves of sliced garlic that's going in stir fry nicely get that wok taste it's like a symphony toss it if you want to toss it nice little slapping noise i know uncle roger likes a nice little slap here in there yes banking my favorite looking beautiful eat the shallot to go transparent yes we're then going to add our chopped zakai our pickles more oil i can see the vegetables softening breaking up nicely the fragrance they're popping and then add that to your chicken uncle roger need maybe a few more seconds i like to brown them a little bit pouring it out pouring it out yeah it's going good so far what next a touch more oil yeah oil done turn the pan up get that hot all right so that way you're gonna crack in three eggs one two and three a little touch of salt oh okay okay it's not traditional again but you're okay now i'm stir-frying the egg scrambling it nicely spreading it out letting it cook garage impressed i cracked with one hand all trees not bad do this for esther uncle roger you can do this i really want this romantic dinner with esther and spot holiday looking good looking good one portion of pad thai you use three eggs three eggs that's a lot but okay uncle watch it i might take a little out you're right i'm gonna take half that out now chop the egg stir fry it a little bit more oil we have a lot of noodles here so you can go lighter on noodles if you wish your noodles and your chicken and everything in that bowl back into the wok just to mashnuto and stir fry that together the noodles are getting nice and caramelized the chicken's looking beautiful let that stir-fry once everything's nice and integrated it should smell a little smoky some of that wake smells beautiful tossed so next bit a pinch of ground white pepper just a pinch half of your sauce stir fry that together very nice so our sauce is in there our noodles are in there everything's looking nice turn that heat way way way down we're nearly there we have sprouts we're gonna add those in say about a half cup of that don't add too much we add it in so your mom don't beat you up when you eat pot thai and then the last thing garlic chives here just a light handful my fire went out smell lovely taste tastes like win the win give it a little taste i'm going to add touch more palm sugar so this is the part where we get to personalize it i'm adding a touch more palm sugar uncle roger need to add my favorite ingredient king of flavor msg free joshua uncle watcher have to bring this through airpod almost got deported they thought a different type of white powder little did you know we already have some right here what you have msg yeah right here hi i got deported for nothing give me why you don't oh he took the whole thing yeah now i don't have any yeah yeah here you go he used so much i'm also gonna finish mine with just a little bit of fresh chopped garlic you don't have to do it but i like it pasta together lightly lovingly make it look beautiful i think that we've done it the final frontier uncle roger me myself and i and a bowl of pad thai bowl in front of us scoop up your pad thai dead center in that bowl you can add all of it you can add a little bit of i'm gonna serve this family style and then to finalize that you're gonna do a nice mound of peanuts toasted and ground whatever uncle roger thinks is beautiful you know this is your painter's palette do whatever feels right i know this isn't traditional let me make a note looks nice so i'm adding a small mound of mung bean sprouts joshua just left his presentation serve these with lime wedges so i'll put them in the bowl for extra presentation purposes and we have a beautiful loving delicious pad thai or what i think to be a good pad thai but there's only one way we can tell let's remove this and unveil our final product good to see you again joshua you look good cuckoo wow i i did a very american portion yeah who can finish this family style too much you want some negative space i thought you said you didn't care about plating by filming with you i have to pretend too much vegetable you didn't even cook this you're eating salad what is this this plate painting very subjective it's all about the taste everything looks caramelized i see the shrimp being toasted properly you see that nice flecks of shrimp throughout the whole thing when you add sauce and you don't reduce it properly it makes a pool but notice how there's no pool it's almost nice and clung to the noodle that looks like a proper pad thai i'm also not surprised but it's not just like you said about visual it's about taste now we find out if i get my uncle title back and if you have a special dinner coming but you'll taste mine i'll taste yours it looked good it looked good just a few dribbles this looks very nice uncle roger i'm a little bit nervous oh yours look good too very good mine's saltier this is saltier i like yours a bit sweeter i like it also i like the fresh the raw garlic you put at the end give it a little bit of something extra a good idea good idea raw garlic you got the funk a little bit of that acidity from the tamarind the chicken's cooked perfectly seasoned perfectly i'm just gonna eat this whole thing i imagine more noodles so i said all the shrimp so this is very shrimp heavy but in a weird way i actually like it more like this i don't know how you feel about mine but i'll tell you right now this is a job for you you deserve that just a lot of msg like the secret you saw how much msg i put on there my mouth is dancing right now it's

Ice Cream...",2022-11-28 21:59:44.385768, i keep seeing this trend with a lot of weird ice cream flavors mac and cheese everything bagel it's gross so let's end this [Music] [Music] so today we're making weird ice cream flavors i thought of three that were weird enough i'm actually a big fan of combining sweet and savory there's a threshold of just like how far are we gonna push it to the point where it's like is this dumb i don't know so that's why we're here today so with that being said let's make this shall we okay we got mac and cheese ice cream wasabi ice cream and buttered croissant look we all know the buttered croissant is probably gonna be the best okay what you want me to pretend like that doesn't sound like the best who's gonna win that's not what this is about it's more so if we can get all three of these to potentially taste good it's all gonna start with the base custard which you'll make by first adding seven large egg yolks to a medium sized bowl to that you'll mix in one cup 180 grams of granulated sugar in a small pinch of salt whistle combined then in a medium-sized sauce pot combine one and a half cups or 355 milliliters of whole milk two and a quarter cup or 540 milliliters of heavy cream now pause this is the point where things will change depending on which flavor you choose but very briefly let me describe a custard making process you heat the milkies to a steamy heat god no boiling please a little bit of the hot liquid to the yolks to temper them whisk it together you add it all back gently heating and mixing until the thickening properties of those yolks make a lovely custard then you churn it alright it's easy that's how it works now for the mac and cheese version you'll heat those creamy milkies over medium low till hot and steamy then you'll add three parmigiano rinds to it do not let this mixture boil or simmer for any amount of time as i said before you wouldn't want to upset right cut the heat and let that steep for 15 minutes then remove your rinds heat it back to a steamy heat no boiling then add a couple ladles of your milkies to your egg sugar mix whisking it together continue adding liquid until your yolks are hot and add all that mixture back to your sauce pot with the milkies now let that bad boy heat over medium low stirring off until your mixture begins to thicken you should cling to a spoon nicely then on three packets of kraft mac and cheese yeah i know terrible all right i'm basically looking to mimic that van lewin ice cream that we've seen across the terrible world of twitter which by the way great ice cream company now once that clings nicely to the back of a spoon strain it into a bowl set over an ice bath and stir until completely cold pour that into a prepared ice cream machine which if you have the budget i would really recommend just dishing out and getting one with the compressor alright you don't have to wait for the base to freeze at all it does all the work for you it's 10 times easier but you could also totally do this in a non-compressor based machine oh what's that you don't even have an ice cream maker well don't you worry because i've already shown you how to make it completely manually link in the description for that so don't start whining with me all right you can turn it in whatever you want churn for 45 minutes until you get a lovely smooth ice cream pop into a container that allows for a proper scoopage lit it and pop it in the freezer overnight now moving on to wasabi this one's much easier make the base as usual seven egg yolks in the bowl one cup or 180 grams of sugar start to combine you got your cream your milk your heat in it it's steamy hot then in a small bowl add two teaspoons or three grams of matcha powder and spoon a couple tablespoons of your custard into that whisk together nicely then pour your matcha mixture back into your base custard temper your yolks twist it together pour back in your sauce pot continue heating over medium low stirring frequently until glossy thickened and clings to the back of a spoon with a loose custard texture like this treating that into your ice bath setup followed by three tablespoons or 23 grams of fresh grated wasabi that's the good stuff right there wow josh using an inaccessible ingredient again oh my lord let's go to twitter and cry i wanna have someone to force wasabi look it's totally cool if you can't get your hands on it or you don't wanna spend the money on i respect that you can use the fake wasabi at the store it doesn't really matter because this is such a disgusting concept as it is now follow that with one tablespoon or 14 grams of sake mix till combined cool completely and yet again turn your ice cream in your ice cream maker you know if i didn't know there was wasabi in here i might just say that it doesn't look disgusting but it's there so now once it's done bag it tag it and freeze it last but not least is the buttered croissant ice cream albeit the least strange it has its own mysterious elements to it first get yourself four croissants cut those into one inch cubes spread it out evenly on a baking sheet and place in an oven preheated to 350 fahrenheit and bake those stirring occasionally until dried and light golden brown like little croutons about six to eight minutes now remove that and let it cool completely on another baking sheet ideally a half sheet spread out half a cup of 36 grams of milk powder pop that into your 350 oven for about one minute now keep a close eye because it does burn easily and very quickly once you have some nice deep golden browning pull it out scrape up any stuck bits and add that to your milkies while your custard is just beginning to heat now make your custard as you did before but once the custard base is done and about to be strained stop there don't strain it and instead whisk in three quarters of all of your croissant croutons which will naturally be significantly less than you think because you ate too many of them now let that steep in the hot custard for 10 minutes and then strain it into your ice bath setup she'll completely then turn that bad boy as we've previously done and once that churn is about one minute out from being completely done add in the remaining quarter of your croissant croutons and let those disperse evenly to get out of your ice cream machine into a storage container lit it and yet again freeze overnight now i will say each of these ice creams had very different textural properties the mac and cheese scooped so beautifully and luxuriously to my surprise the buttered croissant quite nice as well and the wasabi was too gross knowing what was in it so who cares but let's put myself through this for absolutely no reason and taste test this so we have three weird ice cream flavors we're putting the trend to an end okay buttered croissant mac and cheese wasabi right off the bat i feel like i'm gonna prefer this one but we'll start with the worst one no more of that that is bad i think there's a way to make this better that's also not necessary all right next up macaroni and cheese texturally it's ridiculously smooth hear me out this is actually good whatever the hell is in that packet made this ridiculous smooth and velvety what's wrong with like a cheese ice cream right there's cheese dirt cheesecake i like this this is now last buttered croissant a day-to-day choice i would probably choose the butter croissant but getting a little spicy a little wacky i'm gonna choose the crab mac and cheese ice cream that being said we have a winner and a semi-finalist but you want to know what's not a semi-finalist [Music] so [Music] you

Doritos Locos Tacos:...",2022-11-28 21:59:44.385768, this should not exist let's be honest but today we're giving it a reason to [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so today we're making the taco bell nacho fries wow everybody's like oh my god the nacho fries are back and then taco bell's like damn our margin is looking pretty good right now all we gotta do is fry some taters and use the nacho cheese sauce we've been using for 62 years this is why now if there was a taco bell grande version maybe i would be more excited about it but as of now there's not but if we win we'll make one so that being said let's make this shall we wow wow wow we're back at the kfc taco bell combo and it just says now we've rated this before i don't remember what it was exterior 2 out of 10 because i don't like that it's a combo if that changed that i'm sorry menu the consistency has been good so four and ten service let's find out [Music] hi uh can i can i just get the two orders of the nacho fries thank you i'll give it a 5 out of 10. thank you she was very nice she was smiling through her mask you know what 9 out of 10 it's towards the end of the day probably tired and she's still kicking it taco bell wow big step up all right well can't wait to poop so we got the i know it seems confusing all right fries from any fast food place are probably gonna be decent they smell nice they look pretty normal this whole craze about this i'm so confused there are some flavors that i'm kind of liking they're a little dull and out of nowhere there's just like this sweetness i don't understand totally ruined the fry they were on a good track record i was about to be like these aren't bad i feel like they mix the salt with the sugar by accident what the happened then there's this oh i hate this type of cheese sauce i like queso real queso like from texas this is an abomination guess i'll eat it [Music] kind of works i'll give these a three out of ten it's okay all the hype not worth it so why don't we make something worth the hype right let's make this simple and easy seem to be that these are lightly battered seasoned fries you'll need two pounds for 900 grams of russet potatoes wash them peel them cut them into half-inch matchsticks which is a lot easier if you have one of these things granted it's kind of a waste of money unless you plan on making a lot of fries i don't but i guess i like wasting money i don't know like in description if you want the one i'm using once it's done get yourself a large pot filled with water season it generously with salt bring it to a boil add in your potatoes and pull them from the boil just before they're cooked through they'll then be slightly softened on the outside but still crunchy on the inside so for a half inch matchstick that's about three to five minutes pull those let them drain on a paper towel pop them into the fridge on a sheet tray until completely cold and dry now while those are becoming very chilly let's make our nacho dip get a medium sauce pot and add two tablespoons or 28 grams of unsalted butter heat over medium once melted whisk in two tablespoons or 15 grams of all-purpose flour let the cooked stirring often for about 45 seconds and congratulations you have a roux now add in two tablespoons or 30 grams of heavy cream and one cup or 240 milliliters of whole milk whisk together till heated and beginning to thicken and look sometimes it gets a little too thick no worries you can always thin it out with papa's so once you've got a nice sort of bechamel going on you're gonna add one teaspoon or three grams of fresh ground black pepper half a teaspoon or one gram of ground cumin half a teaspoon or one gram of ground cayenne a small pinch of smoked paprika whistle together until combined then add your flamage which is gonna be four ounces or 113 grams of grated american cheese for nostalgia four ounces or 113 grams of cheddar cheese was still completely melted adding extra milk to thin if needed and then finally 2 ounces or 57 grams of grated gruyere cheese again whisk until smooth glossy and luxurious seasoned taste with salt i added a small pinch of dorito powder from the doritos locos taco video because i can and nobody can stop me link in the description for that and that right there is a lovely nacho cheese sauce that not only you can feel good about but maybe dare i say fancy right back to the taters they should be cold if they're not cool go do something else until they are which by the way you can totally do this chilling part a day or two ahead of time which is awesome prep it put in the fridge beautiful but let's see you're ready and they're cold so now we make our fried batter in a large bowl combine one cup or 150 grams of all-purpose flour one and a half teaspoons or eight grams of fine sea salt optionally a quarter teaspoon or one gram of msg two teaspoons or six grams of smoked paprika half a teaspoon or one gram of onion powder half a teaspoon of one gram of ground cumin cumin one teaspoon or three grams of garlic powder half a teaspoon or one gram of cayenne give that a good old fashion and then whisk in three quarters of a cup 180 milliliters of cold water whisk until completely smooth and if it's too thick then keep adding water until it's a relatively loose batter now it should be thick enough to coat and cling to the fry but when you pull the fry out the majority of it should drain off with just a thin veneer left on now hold your got dang horses you can't go dunking them tubers without your fry seasoning so in a small bowl combine one and a half tablespoons or 13 grams of cheddar cheese powder 2 teaspoons or 10 grams of mushroom soup based powder which you can get at most asian markets 2 teaspoons or 6 grams of smoked paprika half a teaspoon or 1 gram of ground cumin 1 teaspoon or 3 grams of garlic powder mix it together then realize that you forgot the salt so add one and a half teaspoons or seven grams of kosher salt whisk and you have a nice fry guy on the fly okay we're nearly there get a large heavy bottom pot fill about halfway the vegetable oil heat it to 350 fahrenheit then in batches gently dunk your fries in the batter drain them on a wire rack set over a baking sheet to get the excess batter off and then in batches gently lay them into your oil and fry for about three to five minutes until beautifully golden brown crisp spears of potato heaven emerge anointed with shimmering oil from the fried gods pop those onto a clean wire rack set over a baking sheet and immediately season with your fry spice generously of course while the potatoes are still hot don't be one of those oh i'll do it a little later people because your seasoning will not stick now all you need to do is pour yourself a nice little ramekin or a big ramekin who cares fill it up with your cheese you got your fries you get to dip it and that's it but wait we have an important note before we taste papa what about a bell grande version oh my children i've never forgotten once you have your fries and your nacho dip you're pretty much good to go to make a belgrande version which taco bell has yet to offer so simply make a mayo sauce consisting of one cup or 200 grams of mayo three tablespoons or 45 grams of valentino's hot sauce one teaspoon or three grams of ancho powder one teaspoon or three grams of garlic powder salt to taste pepper mix lovely and now to assemble get yourself a bowl fries down first then your nacho sauce as much as you like a nice mound of cooked ground beef which you can use the ground beef for my doritos locust video a lovely dollop of sour cream a nice array of your spiced mayo dotted all over diced tomatoes diced avocado which again for some reason half the production crew does not like please roast them in the comments anyways cilantro leaves to garnish a nice sprinkling of your fry spice on your sour cream why not looks nice and optionally some crumbled cotija cheese to finish it off and i'll tell you what brother that makes my bill grande if you know what i mean anyway this is the bell grande version of the fries which taco bell hasn't offered yet so now we are but let's finally see who really won this butt better made fries dip them that's gonna be hot i was hoping it would drip it just like made it stalagmite you know sometimes it's not always about just making it better sometimes it's about making it right making it what it should have been making it what they wanted it to be it just ever so escaped their grasp you're welcome this is a proper season fry with a nacho cheese sauce made with a proper roux this is a mornay sauce this is fine dining but brought into the commercial world it's a dub pono step in taste test please whoa so pawn what's your favorite color a light tan interesting okay do you like nacho fries i've had them once and they were okay i thought they were a little bit disappointing but still like i was punching on them okay cool number one i'm so sexy that's number one number two choo choo the second one obviously is infinitely better most i think the sauce like takes it into a different stratosphere but the craziest thing to me is that your fry tastes more like taco bell than taco bells the seasoning tastes like a mixture of like doritos but with like nachos and what i assume the beef it's a totally different spice that they put on these like the only reason why it's a nacho fries because of the cheese which also got decimated by that that was bananas not only are we the winner it doesn't stop there in fact this never stops you don't have to wait for taco bell to come out with this and be sort of disappointed you can have these year round but you want to know what else you can have year round [Music] you

and the cheapest and make them go head to head [Music] okay so today we are making sushi yet again not just any sushi but specifically makimo sushi rolls for those who don't want to google it we're essentially going to take a makimata roll and add as much expensive stuff as i can think that would make sense in there as possible and then do the polar opposite with the other one which will pretty much purely be vegetable vegetarian probably going to end up adding me at the end we'll decide which one's the best so with that being said let's make this shall we we have two makimoto rolls for you version one which totals around five dollars per serving and still very good now version two is what i'd call the lamborghini aventador svj of makimono which in order to make is gonna cost about 525 dollars yeah this is all for you pal now there is no maki model without the heart and soul of one of my first loves tamaki gold is a great choice i'm going to keep this brief because i've made sushi rice for you before link in the description for the full guide get your rice i'm not going to say it see what's happening here all right you know what this is by now cook your rice season it with sushi zoo ideally in a traditional hangi like you see here then plop it back into your rice cooker cut the heat turn it off but keep it closed so it's lightly warmed and now we can move on to the cheaper version first we make the mushroom element get yourself one pound or 450 grams of fresh shiitake mushrooms remove all of their stems and slice it into half inch pieces heat a large heavy bottom pot with at least 2 inches worth of vegetable oil to 350 fahrenheit then next to that in a medium sauce pot add half a cup 100 grams of granulated sugar half a cup 120 milliliters of mirin three quarters of a cup or 180 milliliters of white distilled vinegar one cup for 240 milliliters of soy sauce one shallot halved can leave the skin on it's fine and two to three cloves of garlic peeled and lightly crushed heat that's swirling occasionally until the sugar's dissolved and the liquid is hot next fry your mushrooms in batches tossing occasionally in the oil until a deep golden brown remove with a spider let it drain slightly and then add that wall hot to your hot steaming liquid and repeat with all of your mushrooms now once that's done keep it submerged and let it sit until room temperature i mean look at these things now optionally you can add spam to this roll without much extra cost so you can just get a can of spam cut that bad boy into one inch thick batons get a medium sized skillet heat it over a medium high with a touch of oil in it syrup beautifully on all sides about one to two minutes each then finish with a tablespoon or two of unsalted butter swirling occasionally until the butter begins to melt and lightly brown now for vegetables easy peasy seedless english cucumber cut into segments that's about as long as half the width of one piece of nori then cut off just the cheeks or the heel quarter turning each time then cut little batons that should equal the same width on all sides like these bad boys then get one ripe avocado quarter it peel it and slice it into third inch thick slices and let us assemble on a very light damp board add a sheet of sushi nori lightly dampen your hands with water get a mounded half cup of your rice layer it on leaving a half inch strip of uncovered nori at the top add on two pieces of your seared spam two pieces of your cucumber a generous handful of your soy mushroom pickle three slices of avocado shingled nicely about five whole chives and then carefully transfer that to a sushi mat roll it up until both ends meet gently press along the whole log roll your log so different side is facing down press it once more pull out a beautiful makimono cut it in half and then cut into one inch pieces now moving on to mr expensive oh boy is it hot in here or is it the hundreds of dollars that caught on fire to buy these ingredients first fresh wasabi mayo in a medium-sized bowl add two cups for 420 grams of koopie mayonnaise along with this guy right here this is fresh wasabi the total cost of this is around 80 is it expensive yes of course but it's also unlike any wasabi you've ever had because probably you've never had actual wasabi it's slightly sweet fragrant and one of the most sensuous spicy sensations possible add two tablespoons or 20 grams of that next heat a small saucepan over medium heat add just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan then add in three sliced serranos seeds and all right don't be a baby it's fine then add one large shallot thinly sliced four cloves of garlic thinly sliced and a two inch nub of ginger also thinly sliced stir that to coat with the oil and sweat that bad boy stirring occasionally until all the vegetables have softened but receive no browning whatsoever add all that to a blender along with two and a half tablespoons or 38 grams of yuzu juice 2 tablespoons or 20 grams of shiradashi blend that on high until smooth add that to your mayo season the taste with salt whistle combined and then add either more juicy juice or rice vinegar to taste to make it as acidic as you like but try to have some self-control there all right too much is gonna make it too thin next crab salad you'll need five king crab legs break those down pop the meat out this is also assuming that your king crabs are pre-cooked if they're not then obviously you'll need to poach them first now shred that in a medium-sized bowl then separately mix together half a cup or 100 grams of koopie mayo and a quarter cup or 48 grams of sriracha add that to your king crab along with the zest of one lemon mix mix mix until thoroughly combined and that's a crab salad now for the a5 wagyu i've got a beautiful 20-ounce strip loin about to go over there and give it a little kiss first try and square off your beef cutting any excess fat in a straight line like this and simply cut that into batons that are about two and a half to three inches long and one inch thick so a rectangular prism sort of anyway next we're going to katsu fry it so you're welcome you'll need 1 medium bowl of 2 cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour 2 cups 170 grams of panko bread crumbs 2 eggs whisk together then all you got to do take a baton toss it in the flour coat thoroughly shake off the excess then coat in the egg you guessed it thoroughly and finally in your panko breadcrumbs coating every single piece of surface area i want that real estate coated place it to the side and bread the rest of your a5 steak thingies then just get a seven quart heavy bottom pot filled with about 3 quarts of vegetable oil which has been heated at 350 fahrenheit add your steak fingers in batches and fry those bad boys for about 30 to 45 seconds or until a beautiful golden brown katsu style a5 steak finger emerges now first nori down then rice follow that up with a few leaves of thai basil shingled in a line on the lower third of your nori then very thinly sliced lime quartz also shingled in the same fashion yes they exist then a quarter cup of your crab salad shaping it into some sort of a log on the same lower third a touch of julienne fresh cucumber followed by julian carrot two of your a5 steak katsu fingers roll that guy up it's a little full alright i get it it's a big boy form it roll it onto the other side form it again remove cut it in half slice slice beautifully and you have a lovely fatty crunchy all the flavors under the sun makimono for an excessive amount of money uh of course also don't forget the sauce all right we've spent this much time now with a little sprinkle of togarashi for peppa flair let's taste test and see if packing your wallet extra thick before going to the grocery store gets you a better roll yeah i love sushi the cheap one for this price the expensive one for this price wowie the cheaper one bam marinated mushroom you can remove the spam and make this vegetarian you like that see i told you i'd have something for you oh busting me open the marinated mushrooms make the sushi roll if the spam wasn't in here i'd still be doing a hoe down look at the way i boogie now the expensive one a5 wagyu king crab fresh wasabi rooney [Music] everybody averted their eyes i'm just going to say it right now the expensive one is 10 times better than this am i saying that this one's bad no honestly in some occasions you may not want a mouthful of a5 wacky maybe you want something lighter but the complexity of flavors the textures the fattiness the richness but also balanced at the same time i obviously should try this with a sauce i'll say right now it's not the sauce although the sauce is delicious it is not the sauce this roll is the better roll without a doubt by a large margin but the barrier to entry is this right here it's gonna be up to you to decide whether or not you want to pay for this experience but you know what you don't have to pay for b-roll [Music] [Music] you

panda express beijing beef what is it it seems like a riff off of some sort of mongolian beef but not quite really it's beef thinly sliced fried and then coated in a sauce which i suspect is just a sauce they've reused from elsewhere we're gonna taste test find out you know how this all works so with all that being said let's make this shall we oh my god it's panda express so we're here it's kind of bopping i'm just gonna go inside cause i can't go to the drive-through we got it i go in there and i was like you know i didn't realize they're actually using like woks and i see them stir-frying and adding sauces like maybe they're doing it better than i thought and i got the last bit of beijing beef and he pulls out just this huge bag and just pours out all this lifeless colorless just pre-fried beef which i get from an operational standpoint genius it look like whenever you remove the pancreas from a science experiment in science class anyway let's go so we got the bog real ingredients freshly prepared i would say this statement is relatively accurate relatively they go he's white he needs a fork come on man it looks alright floppier than anticipated no distinct smells sort of just like that non-descript panda express sweet sauce i would argue that it's all the same thing but just slightly different i'm confused pause it's not bad so everybody relax this is just orange chicken with spicy chili flakes in it it just is this is the orange chicken sauce panda don't you be fooling me just order the orange chicken all right they're bad either way it doesn't matter so instead we're gonna make what i think that they were actually going for listen this might as well be a butt faster brother because you can definitely make this before you go to panda express and back but that's not the point okay i get it now to begin you'll need about one and a half pounds or 680 grams of flank steak or rib eye if you want to be real fancy since mine was so big i sliced it in half to make it more manageable and then just slice that bad boy into half inch thick strips against the grain so you get those nice pieces that's your beef two bowl season generously with salt to taste half a teaspoon or half a gram of ground white pepper one inch knob of ginger grated then just toss together until combined now we need to set up our breading station what you can't bread beef yes i can and i'm almost certain that theirs is spreaded too anyway for your breading station you'll need one egg along with one and a half tablespoons or 22 grams of water whisk together and that's your egg wash then for the flour dredge in a medium mixing bowl combine half a cup or 70 grams of cornstarch three quarters of a cup or 113 grams of all-purpose flour and a generous pinch of salt whisk together and wow okay we're almost ready to cook and assemble but listen we never start a stir-fry without our sauce sitting on the side waiting for us get a medium-sized bowl add half a cup or 120 milliliters of water a quarter cup or 57 grams of granulated sugar 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of light soy sauce 2 tablespoons or 28 grams of dark soy sauce 2 tablespoons or 27 grams of white distilled vinegar and optional 1 tablespoon or 15 grams of chinese black vinegar 2 tablespoons or 33 grams of ketchup yeah yeah hear me out pal okay make sense 2 tablespoons or 33 grams of sriracha a third cup or 80 milliliters of hoisin sauce half a teaspoon or 2 grams of finely ground sichuan peppercorns albeit also optional but it'll give you that light tap in the pants that nobody else can whiz together took a mind and that's your sauce for your little stir-fry okay it's cook and assembly time for your beef get a large wok fill it with vegetable oil about halfway up heated 350 fahrenheit carefully lower in your beef and fry in batches until very light golden and crisp morsels of both emerge drain them in a wire rack and repeat with the rest of your beef once everything's fried pour out your oil wipe your wok clean and then another three tablespoons are 30 grams of vegetable oil heat it over medium high till the oil is hotter than my sandy cheeks then add in a lovely mixture of one red bell pepper cut into one inch pieces and one yellow onion cut into one inch pieces also season that lightly with salt in stir fry aggressively for good old-fashioned uncle roger approved wake and oh don't worry we're going after him real soon anyway once your veg begins to lightly brown and the onion starts to turn translucent add in all of your sauce along with one teaspoon or four grams of fine ground chili flakes such as heaven facing or gochugaru stir and boil that over medium high and let it reduce for two minutes now while that's reducing in a small bowl combine two teaspoons or five grams of corn starch and two teaspoons or 12 grams of water whisk together and that's well a slurry once your sauce is reduced whisk in half of your slurry chicken for thickness and if it's not quite thick to your liking then well further add the rest now once you have a beautiful glaze add in your beef toss aggressively to coat every little nook and cranny i want no uncoated pieces of beef in this thing now once coated cut off the heat and finish that bad boy with the jw signature extra garlic at the end which is 3 cloves of finely chopped garlic tossed until thoroughly coated and get a bowl lay down some steaming hot boy rice layer on your buff and let's see who our winner is today wow look at that i didn't really get an idea of how goopy this looked until i made this i know the first comments gonna be like well josh they're sad no no no this was sitting far before i even walked into the doors of panda express okay you already know how this went tenderness too i will say onions and peppers in this pan express was onto something that's a good combo it's beefy it's rich there's a little bit of crunch but more specifically the sauce has depth it's garlicky it's rich as opposed to just being orange chicken sauce these are both tasty right this isn't bad this is just significantly better than what it should have been originally but we need our taste tester please yuma what's your experience with panda express i never ate it really wow you know most people here they just chew twice and swallow but yuma he chews on his food he you know he masticates [Music] the first one you can taste everything the beef is tender the other one just tastes like sugar number one winner the second one just says why why is this funny i don't know why they just didn't take off the blindfold thank you sweetie i love you you already here this is straight sugar we already know mr orange chicken reused sauce whatever make it from scratch make it original but more specifically make it for the b-roll [Music] [Music] [Music] you

it means a ton to us we work very very hard for you and much more to come so let's move on to the actual video yeah yeah made in a pan but guess what it's still a cake which has brought us here [Music] okay so today we are making a pancake layer cake a pancake cake any time you make pancake batter you're already on the way to making an actual cake you might as well spend the extra time uh okay you know what in this scenario i get it a few hours of processing i get that okay but it's special we're making this special for you do i expect everyone to make it no but if you want a cake that you've never had in your entire life that is sure to tantalize your taste buds you got the pancake cake but then we have peanut butter frosting salted maple caramel frosting candied bacon crumble all topped up with a nice drench of maple so with that being said let's make this shall we wow a pancake layer cake for the millions the elements are well pancake salted maple caramel frosting peanut butter frosting and a millionaire's baking crumble to represent the millions of you first let's talk about peanut butter frosting very easy to a medium sized bowl add one cup or 220 grams of softened unsalted butter and three quarters of a cup or 170 grams of creamy peanut butter using electric mixers or a whisk if you're brave beat those together until creamy and combined insert mixing in 3 cups or 350 grams of powdered sugar just a little bit at a time until all that's been added and it's fully incorporated then add half a teaspoon or three grams of fine sea salt beat that in then half a teaspoon or two grams of vanilla extract and lastly two tablespoons or 30 grams of whole milk beat that in and it should look something like this now pop that into a piping bag and onto frosting number two salted maple caramel in a medium sauce pot add half a cup or 112 grams of salted butter a quarter cup of 55 grams of granulated sugar half a cup 143 grams of maple syrup 2 tablespoons or 15 grams of light corn syrup and set that over medium heat and let that cook together and once it starts to simmer reduce the heat to low give it a little swirl here and there to emulsify you never do set for three to four minutes then pour your ultra light caramel into a medium sized bowl and let it cool to room temp i would recommend covering it with something to prevent a film forming once cooled begin mixing with electric beaters or a whisk then beat in three cups or 350 grams of powdered sugar again in batches add a half teaspoon or two grams of fine sea salt which i forgot to add to the caramel totally fine that's the new recipe now once it starts getting a bit too thick add in 2 tablespoons or 30 grams of heavy cream beat on high until smooth creamy and luxurious next candied bacon peanut crumble if you have a peanut allergy i'm sorry simply do not use peanuts in a small bowl combine half a cup 110 grams of light brown sugar and half a teaspoon or two grams of fine ground black pepper mix together till combined then add one pound or 454 grams of your nicest bacon onto a foil lined baking sheet and generously season your bacon with your brown sugar mix on just one side then pop that into an oven preheated to 350 fahrenheit and bake for around 20 minutes let it cool completely and then rough chop your bacon with a knife get yourself a food processor add half a cup or 75 grams of toasted peanuts let that on high till medium coarse then add your chopped bacon oh josh why did i chop my bacon we pre-chop our bacon to make it easier to blend here relax button on high until everything is relatively similar in size and a beautiful medium course like this next pancakes so i'm essentially going to make a basic pancake batter but a little more up in a stand mixer or a large bowl oh so tired of these recipe elitist using a stand mixer so unattainable literally just don't use a stand mixer bowl and a whisk just fine anyway add six cups or 900 grams of all-purpose flour put on that big old ball whisk thing then add three quarters of a cup or 150 grams of granulated sugar 3 tablespoons or 26 grams of baking powder 2 teaspoons or 12 grams of fine sea salt 3 4 of a teaspoon or 8 grams of baking soda begin whisking that on medium low till combined then mix in 4 cups or 1 liter of whole milk three whole eggs and three quarters of a cup or 170 grams of gently melted butter mixed it until nice and smooth and homogeneous now look giant cake situation goes a few ways you can either double this recipe and split it between two sheet trays that have been generously greased and lined with parchment paper or you could do a one times batch and use the scrap as the bottom layer of the cake which we found coincidentally on another pancake cake from christina tosi at milk bar shout out to her thank you for the inspiration look it all depends on how perfect you want your cake to look i wanted mine to look super perfect so i doubled it but you should expect a decent amount of scrap which i'll explain what to do with later now once you have your cake laid down in your baking sheet you can optionally add and scatter around evenly the little maple candy balls for my mcdonald's mcgriddle recipe link in the description for that then just pop those cakes into the oven at 350 fahrenheit and bake for 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean remove those from the oven then transfer to a wire rack and cool completely once room temp use a cake ring that's been set to about seven to eight inches punch out your cakes punching out three to four if you doubled it and okay you got scrap wham keep it bag it freeze it use it immediately you can make cake balls there are plenty of things to do with cake scrap google it alright we're finally ready to assemble to your kick ring which should still be the same size when you punched out your cakes add a nice little cake collar to fit the ring make a quick simple syrup of a quarter cup or 55 grams of granulated sugar and a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of water heated and dissolved now assembly time add in your first cake layer brush generously with simple syrup then a fat layer of your peanut butter frosting which you'll likely use all of it half of your baking crumble evenly spread across the surface then another layer of cake brush with simple syrup yet again followed by another generous layer of this time your maple caramel frosting the other half of your bacon crumble evenly spread and finally your top layer pancake lightly tent that with plastic wrap and pop her in the fridge for a little slumber overnight to solidify then when you're ready pull it out let it temper at room temperature for about 10 minutes grab your sharpest knife cut it into slices place a pat of lightly melting butter on top if desired and hit it with maple syrup so that we can taste test and see if this even tastes like a pancake in the first goddang place it's 420 big pancake if this isn't a pancake layer cake then i don't know what is now i want you to syrup this i really do because it wouldn't really be a big pancake without syrup and i intentionally did not over sweeten the cake so that you could add syrup so you should this was completely accidental that this ended up on 420. i feel like i'm getting high eating this it has all the flavors you would have in a pancake breakfast you got the salty bacon the sweet maple and if you like peanut butter on your pancakes you can be my friend and i also do you got that peanut butter frosting the maple frosting all works together somehow this is like my childhood favorite way to eat pancakes solidified into the perfect actual cake right they call them pancakes this is a pancake cake but i'll tell you another thing that has all your breakfast dreams in it b-roll [Music] [Music] [Music] you

how did this end up being 25 oh I got the Mimosa and the French toast was like 13 14 bucks when it should be this price right here that's but cheaper [Music] oh right so like I said French toast I think is commonly probably one of the most overpriced things on a brunch menu I can imagine it is literally leftover stale bread soaked in milk and eggs and put in a pan and what if you took French toast and made it nice and thick like two to four inches thick and you could have it for this price right here this is a breakfast or brunch eating experience regardless of the price so let's make this shall we okay it's giant French toast not as crazy as you think by the way look I'm real sorry about my voice okay I was yelling a bunch at the Burger event in LA to which many of you came so thank you for coming it was so good to see all of you and thank you for destroying my vocal cords first off you need two solid loaves of unsliced white bread the cheaper the better but usually bread is pretty cheap so should be fine as an alternative you can use a modified version of my multi-purpose dough which comes out to this Price Right Here wanna go that route cool come on one cup or 240 milliliters of water and one cup or 240 milliliters of whole milk heat to 95 Fahrenheit and add one tablespoon or 14 grams of instant yeast mix still dissolved then add two egg yolks and two whole eggs whisk until finally whisk in two tablespoons or 26 grams of granulated sugar then get yourself a very large bowl and add 5 cups or 750 grams of bread flour 3 teaspoons or 18 grams of fine sea salt with still combined now if you're using a stand mixer which is optional way way add your liquid to the stain mixer Bowl put it on medium low and add your flour mix in a quarter cup increments till all of it's added and just let it mix and knead for two to three minutes or till smooth then add five tablespoons or 70 grams of softened unsalted butter and mix for three to five minutes until you get a smooth Supple dough if you're doing it by hand replace the butter with vegetable oil and add that to the liquid mixture and of course mix and need by hand now that any elbow grease can't fix now once you've got a big boy dough shape it into a ball and place it a large grease bowl and cover with plastic wrap no name on him today very sorry now once doubled and plump about one and a half hours plop it out onto a floured work surface divide into two even pieces fold each piece into a rough rectangle roll that rectangle starting from the long side to create a tube place your tube into a generously greased one pound loaf pan and repeat with the other half gently intent each of your thick tubes with greased plastic wrap proof for one more hour or until it just slightly starts to peek above the line of your bread pan oh so sweet wow look at him now brush with egg wash consisting of one egg yolk and a splash of water then pop it into an oven set to 350 Fahrenheit and bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until a rich golden brown Beauty emerges now optionally you can brush it with a little bit of melted butter which is a tiny amount of cost here but if you're avoiding that then uh don't do that pop those guys under their sides to cool completely I know they look a little silly turned on their side but it helps keep your tops up nice and rounded okay now we can talk massive undeniably moist French toast get your loaves of bread cut off the end pieces cut them into three to four inch thick segments which will get you three to four pieces per loaf but let's just say you get six total oh Josh only six servings listen pal if you can eat a whole one of these and still be okay afterwards then please call a physician one of these is at least two to three servings so split it in your body and wallet will thank you for your custard soak get a deep large bowl and add three whole eggs two egg yolks and to that you'll add pinch of allspice one teaspoon or three grams of brown cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg of course frustrated is lovely but pre-ground is fine too we scold it together token mind actually pause you know what I've noticed recently people adding my ingredients out of order I do many things for a reason you have to mix your spices with your eggs first before adding anything else otherwise you'll just have spices floating on top of this and not thoroughly mixed in Despicable disgusting and unacceptable it's science so don't try to be fancy and Skip once combined whisk in two tablespoons or 26 grams of granulated sugar and then whisk in half a cup or 120 milliliters of heavy whipping cream one and a half cups or 350 milliliters of whole milk let's continue to get a beautifully creamy and spiced custard technically not a custard but I call it that because it's gonna get nice and moist on the inside okay it's time to cook these preheat your oven to 375 fahrenheit then heat a 12 inch non-stick skillet over medium heat add just enough butter to coat the Pan about two to three teaspoons once melted and bubbling add your girthy bread to your custard let it soak for about 10 seconds gently flip it and soak for another 10 seconds if the bread is still holding up quite well and it needs more liquid penetration then repeat that process one more which you likely will need to then carefully transfer it to your pan and let that cook and toast for 2-3 minutes then flip to reveal what should be a beautifully toasted thick French toast side toast for another one to two minutes then transfer to your preheated oven for seven to ten minutes or until lightly firmed up and cook through a lot of cool slightly and guess what you got the girthiest French toast in the wild west or uh wherever you live sure we can go with a big pad of melty butter drenched in liquid golden syrup from the land of maple Dreamscapes which is great or we could go toasted marshmallow hot chocolate sauce and ice cream you tell me pal for the chocolate sauce in a medium sauce pot combine half a cup 108 grams of white granulated sugar a quarter cup or 42 grams of light brown sugar a quarter teaspoon or 2 grams of fine sea salt with the tokaman and then whisk in half a cup or 46 grams of unsweetened cocoa powder with that taco mind and a lot of whisking here and finally half a cup or 118 milliliters of cold water now while frequently stirring or whisking bring that to a boil over medium high then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer stirring often until thickened and glossy about three minutes now while that's going in or take four marshmallows place them on a skewer or work or whatever you want to do and brush them with a flame with either your stovetop or kitchen torch until charred all over don't skimp on this here we need these dark even if you don't like them like that trust me now once those are beautifully charred add that to your chocolate sauce cut the heat and whisk everything in until melted and combined last of all whisk in two teaspoons or 9 grams of vanilla extract and you have a beautiful [Music] all right my voice is a little too  up today for that the wrist is straightforward girthy toast down drench in your lovely chocolate sauce to your heart's content and please make sure that sauce is warm but not too hot and optionally but recommended a fat scoop of vanilla ice cream keep it simple okay no need to go crazy with ice cream flavors because what happens is you get this New Creation as the ice cream melts and combines with the chocolate sauce it creates its own brand new flavor so Fork it cut it maybe look at this with a chair behind you because you'll be out of breath once you see that glistening bite now let's taste test these big boys and see if this is the French toast of the gods that is big French toast oh so traditional is there a pool to make this big I don't know oh my knife just like falls through [Music] yes I'll share wow this is really what French toast was supposed to be anyone who's cooked the stick will understand this a thin steak is not good gets overcooked you want it thick soak it's medium rare now I'm not saying this is medium rare but I am saying the thickness is what helps keep the French toast from getting overcooked it's not a stiff piece of bread it is Airy custard on the inside and the outside's crispy and beautiful it's luscious it's rich I feel like this is what French toast is meant to be all right fancy one this is the moist maker good Lord we took a breakfast item and basically elevated it to a high tiered dessert regardless of your choice you know what to do but you want to know what else knows what to do b-roll all right foreign [Music]

inch coins score each of those coins in a crosshatch pattern on just one side cut into quarters pop it into a medium-sized bowl season generously with salt let those sit for 5 minutes then drain the

fan of wingstop i do enjoy their wings i also like rick ross and i keep seeing him talking about it not gonna lie very entertaining so this is another tough one for me they're lemon pepper wings an iconic choice when you go to wingstop i get it so we're gonna make the traditional lemon pepper wings but if we do that and we beat them then we're making the lemon pepper wet too there's not a lot to say here the boasting will come afterwards so with all that being said let's make this shall we i'd like to just place an order for pick up what would you like can i just do 10 lemon pepper wings cool thank you that was fast honestly service 8 out of 10. i could not understand what he said in the beginning otherwise it would have been 10 out of 10. it was also 13 for 10 wings okay let's go let the farty party begin hello it's in a strip mall and has no actual building or facade to it so it's gonna get a one out of ten i hate that although that doesn't mean the food's bad menu we already know what it is because they took away lemon pepper wet and their flavors are so limited i'm gonna give it a four and a half out of ten that's a real rating for once we already did the service that was ten out of ten or nine out of 10. somewhere in that range i'll be back okay if anyone comes in the car you have to kill them i'm ready to perform that task for you all right i'll be back bye [Music] hi it smelled like a petco in there yeah okay let's go so we've got bag secured cringe no more of that okay i mean these look good smell nice i like wingstop better than i like buffalo wild wings so this may be a little bit more biased whoa josh likes something yeah i do it's just most of the things that you like suck i'm gonna use my tweezers again even though i chip my tooth with them yeah that hurt okay so we don't need ranch the first thing i want to say about these wings they don't really smell like lemon that's the weird thing i've only had this flavor from here once i know i smell pepper and that's it these are good is this a butt better first i actually like these wings they're still crispy which is a surprise because we picked them up and brought them here wing stop good work it's got that sort of balance of intense salt intense acidity a little bit of heat it's lemony here's my one complaint it's not as lemony as it should be i feel like when i think of lemon pepper i want lemon to like you know so but better first delicious but are they the absolute maximum that they should be no and we're here to make that with culinary reflection right what is a lemon pepper wing without lemon pepper seasoning well it's literally not a lemon pepper wing that means lemon pepper seasoning is literally the heart and soul of these wings so instead of some nasty lemon extracts we're using real lemon peels so get yourself seven lemons peel them with your best sharpest peeler try to get as little of the white pith on these peels if possible once they're peeled you'll dehydrate them using ideally a dehydrator or an oven for the dehydrator method simply pop these peels evenly spaced apart on a dehydrator rack then into your dehydrator that's been preheated to 105 fahrenheit and dried those bad boys for 24 hours oh my gosh josh that's so long where excuse me i don't care jokes aside if you go the oven method it'll be faster but you will lose significantly more lemon flavor but to do that simply pop the peels on a wire rack and into an oven preheated to 200 fahrenheit or as low as your oven will go for 20 to 30 minutes or till completely dry and snappy once they're dry let them cool to room temp about 10 minutes then pop them into a blender and blend on high until as fine as possible now it's time in a bowl combine three and a half tablespoons or 34 grams of kosher salt one and a half teaspoons or six grams of granulated citric acid you can find it at a lot of grocery stores and i've seen it at whole foods but if not the link is in the description half a teaspoon or two grams of onion powder one teaspoon or five grams of shiitake mushroom powder which is literally just dried shiitake mushrooms ground into a powder all your dehydrated lemon powder and finally a quarter cup or 33 grams of fresh ground black pepper give that a lemony and you've got your lemon pepper seasoning which should make any wing call itself lucky should it be coated in it one little taste to have your mouth moister than an oyster i'll tell you that brother now making these wings is real easy get yourself a seven quart pot filled with about three and a half quarts of vegetable oil heat it to 325 fahrenheit then while that's heating let's get a lemon pepper butter ready in a small sauce pot add a quarter cup or 90 grams of unsalted butter heat over medium heat just until melted add 3 tablespoons or 24 grams of your lemon pepper seasoning stir that together cut off the heat and add in one clove of garlic braided stir that in two and you're ready for the party get yourself three pounds or about one and a half kilos of wings with a good mix of drumettes and flats in a separate large bowl add two tablespoons or 15 grams of starch then add your wings toss to cook completely season lightly to taste with salt toss again then in two to three batches fry your wings until pale but cooked all the way through about three to five minutes placing each batch of finished wings on a wire rack to drain then increase your oil temperature to 375 fahrenheit and fry your wings one more time in batches again please don't throw it all in for two to four minutes each or until a deep golden brown and crispy set of wings emerge repeat with the rest of them and pop them into a large bowl add your lemon pepper butter and a touch of flaky salt testico generously hit it with extra lemon pepper seasoning to taste then simply pop them onto a large bowl or on a plate optionally top it off with a little bit of fresh grated lemon zest you know it looks nice and it smells that is a lemon pepper wing now could this undeniably simple recipe defeat a winged king let's find out it's refreshing and stank at the same time you got to do that one that's good in lemon pepper this is everything the lemon pepper wing was supposed to be it's citrusy like step on my neck with the citrus and it does i just now have begun to realize how flat this falls and how this is more salty than it is sour it's not balanced so obviously i think we win let's bring on the taste test i will say that these are very similar so i'm interested to see how you'll depict this and what your opinion will be wing number one wing number two yeah yeah number one is the better one you can taste the lemon that's the biggest thing these definitely are flat i like wingstop on its own but like with all the lemon zest on it miles and miles better okay so we got the win of course naturally right this is a simple dish so the minuscule details are the most important but if you don't want them dry and you want them wet because wingstop took that away well we're gonna make that too right folks we didn't yet let's talk lemon peppy wet and yes you'll use the same seasoning from the beginning now for this one we'll be breading our wings get yourself three pounds of wings yet again this time cover them with just enough buttermilk to coat it's about two cups or 480 milliliters season that buttermilk with salt to taste keep it generous add your wings and toss to fully coat you can let those marinate overnight or if you're in a hurry you can let them sit for about 10 minutes now when you're ready to fry first make the wettest lemon pepper wet sauce of all time listen when i say what i mean we'll start off with sort of a bermante in the bottom of a saucepan add the juice of two whole lemons and two tablespoons for 30 grams of water heat over medium heat till it starts to get steamy and hot but not boiling reduce the heat to medium low and add half a cup or 112 grams of cold salted butter as a single log begin whisking constantly until all that's melted and emulsified then add another half cup or 112 grams of cold salted butter yet again whisk till completely melted and emulsified please listen carefully do not boil this liquid because boiling will break the emulsion and you will not receive a kiss now once it's melted emulsified and beautiful add one tablespoon of 12 grams of garlic powder 2 tablespoons or 18 grams of our lemon pepper seasoning give that a taste and add more lemon pepper seasoning if desired now for your flour dredge get a large bowl and add one cup 150 grams of all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons or 15 grams of cornstarch half a teaspoon or 2 grams of powder 1 teaspoon or 3 grams of fine sea salt 1 tablespoon or 11 grams of garlic powder and finally 1 tablespoon or 8 grams of our lemon pepper fry heat that same amount of oil from earlier to 350 fahrenheit then in two to three batches add your butter milk wings to your dredge coat thoroughly so every nook and cranny is dredged shake off the excess flour and fry for 46 minutes or until they reach an internal temp of 165 fahrenheit and a golden brown and lovely chicken emerges you know the chicken crusty as they say treat on a wire rack and repeat with the rest now i would recommend saucing these in batches because these wings are much larger with the breading on them so add your wings to a bowl drizzle in your lemon pepper wet to taste season with a little extra flaky salt toss to coat completely then dump them out on a platter no garnish necessary let me show you why lemon pepper wet should have never left the menu kind of like these the best by a lot first off the crunch followed by a little bit of chew the sauce seeped in it's crunchy it's juicy rich salty honestly we won before so now it's a double win but you know what else is a double win b-roll [Music] you

right over there beautifully saute I did eliminate a couple of ingredients out of this because I wanted it to be faster a little bit of salt wow what else can we do while we're waiting we can open the can one of my uh least favorite tools a can opener red peppi flakes get those alike toasting sauce in Pinch of Sugar a little more salt peppy good Lord all right a little towel I don't have a lid you think we're gonna beat him today you know what I don't think so they told us 20 minutes we're gonna get there in 15. so we have to wait five minutes I feel like we're gonna have to wait longer sauce is simmering a little stir this simmer's over here cast iron pan really you can use any shallow pan you can also use a deep pan put some oil in there wow wow wow A lot of people are like oh Josh you had this stuff already measured out you know that's not very fair I'm sorry do you think the restaurant doesn't have everything measured out and their oil already going and everything already pre-prepped and their chicken already breaded I haven't even breaded my chicken I'm just now heating up my oil we're moving faster than time okay think about that one I don't want to get another cutting board so this is my cutting board chicken in and I open her up nice and good this is broken I'm just gonna pound it like this spider piece of chicken boom boom bam all right we're gonna whisk this up I like to add a splash of water just makes it less thick and it does the same damn thing so breading station's good it doesn't have to be pre-measured at all so I'll put a little salt in the flour a little bit of Peppy there's no reason to measure it all it's doing is coating the chicken right now he's dipping the the chicken in the flour and I hope he remembers the eggs because last time he didn't remember the egg chicken first in your flour nicely even though I'm in a hurry guess what I'm still gonna take the time to properly cook my chicken chickens in the egg coating nicely into the panko lovely chicken's coated now I can do more than one very easily this would take not that much more time but I'm just gonna do one we're in a hurry but we still clean up looks like it's either inside or next to a whole food you can't see the sign I hope my food's done so they're not even at the restaurant yet we're actually almost done so I'm just gonna make a second one I'll use this broken one I don't care but am I scared of a broken chicken the only thing I'm afraid of is a broken heart chickens in the flour in the panko there's a new tossing method for you like that do you think this oil is hot Vic I can't tell at this point I'm just chilling where am I supposed to park bro trying to beat Josh and I can't park not good at all there is literally no parking landing spot chicken boom bang let's see if our sauce is ready that looks nice do you want to freaking eat that this is the part where I text Josh that we're here and he starts freaking out just a little bit more they're at the restaurant well I'm almost done wait if salt should we just have a little fun with this ooh yeah I found some Genoa salami I'm just gonna put this in there real quick it is still good look we're making a new recipe right now just throw it in there that Heat's gonna start to melt that salami fat it's going to contribute some of its saltiness its spiciness at this point I could have measured it and taking a poop all right sauce is done I have to check the order don't want to repeat it episode one here it is time to head back ready to fry our chicken what do you do when your oil is too hot you just add a little splash of extra oil why because that lowers the overall temperature because this oil is a different temperature chicken I'll do the thick one first lay them gently in oh it looks like a little heart I'm just having a good old time are you guys having a good time all right slice up some chives nice and thin little flip oh my lordy Lord have you ever flip this and you're like oh I could have gotten more color on that you could just do this and guess what it's gonna get the color culinary technique oh Jesus literally all we have left to do is fry this put it here put the sauce on cheese oven so we've basically won this but I'm also concerned about whether or not this is gonna cook in time that I'm at the mercy of this pan I feel like he's done I feel like we've been here forever escalators took long to go up parking was hard to find UPS guy was in the way supposed to be quick and fast to pick up and it's not pull this out while we're waiting we got our mozzarella we got our mozzarella the New Yorkers out there is that just like short or is that like how you think it's spelled I'm gonna add a little bit of salt to this hot chicken I got my elements cheese sauce chicken please hurry have we just done one I'd be done by now I'm gonna do this all the way through okay I'm committed flip it beautiful every red light every red light every light's been red I don't understand I don't understand maybe it is The Flash shirt maybe I overdid it maybe one upstairs is like hey you need to calm down young man I'm good hopefully I think you love it when someone's like oh yeah we're fine hopefully all right we're at 150 degrees internal temperature please ways you can make chicken cook faster is just gently move it around the pan look at that oh Jesus chicken down a little bit of salt I went the wrong way so I just added two minutes are you conspiring against the fans I'm with the fans shout out to the conversation tomato sauce who's slightly modified with a little bit of salami in there one mound of cheese it's going in the oven I forgot to turn the broiler on it still has to finish in there we missed the turn but we're gonna get there faster now because we're on the freeway so we're making up time for all the red lights it's just working that way it's the shirt okay we're at the mercy of this if this can get done in five minutes then we will be all right it's even on I think it turned off yep it did turn off gonna help the broiler out a little bit yes a little bit we're so far ahead I cannot have this not be a dub okay probably already just sitting there it's a little smile on his face ready for me to walk in like yeah I did it turned off again like I can touch the glass that is not good at this point I'll finish my goddamn self you know we're not driving any faster we're going speed limit safety precautions seat belt so I've received word that they're two minutes away little do they know I'm two seconds away

they're still not here look at that you like that Vic yeah the door is not locked today uh flash lost today man sorry bro I know this isn't but better but good Lord time for the taste test my turn first ah this is a lot simpler than how I like my chicken parm and yet it is still so good and if you want to crank it up throw in a couple more things in the sauce add more spice to the chicken do whatever you want obviously the time Factor can handle it good chicken parm big dub happy with it but we need the real taste testing round there we go all right so that's number one or sorry that's number two my apologies why do we start with two do you have a problem with the number two I recently I've been having problems with number two number one big bye boy number two here number one here in your mouth hole this is next there we go as per usual not a butt better but it was a butt faster we won on every single front it has everything you want in a chicken parm more specifically done

stadium hot dog is sort of a staple when you go out it's american culture right there we're just gonna let it be seven dollars with just a plain hot dog with a fart of ketchup on it unacceptable dodger dogs are a part of my life my childhood that being said it should be good so why can't we make it gourmet homemade hot dogs homemade everything relish onions and a trio of sauce flavors all in one to make the cheapest and greatest stadium dog that there is so with all that being said let's make this shall we making a hot dog is an uncomplicated process well not this one let's begin with the dog first gonna start with three pounds or 1.3 kilos of pork shoulder and three pounds or 1.3 kilos of beef chuck roast cut that into long strips and feed them through a meat grinder josh what kind of whack butt cheaper is this hear me out totally buy pre-ground meat which is totally fine but if you happen to have the 50 kitchenaid attachment then grind it yourself i usually grind mine twice to get it ultra fine and emulsified from there knead your ground meat like a fine dough till creamy looking in a separate medium bowl optionally add 72 grams of sausage binder flour totally optional two and a half tablespoons or 24 grams of smoked paprika two tablespoons or five grams of mustard powder one tablespoon or five grams of coriander powder two teaspoons or five grams of ground black pepper two tablespoons or 40 grams of kosher salt one tablespoon or 15 grams of light brown sugar and less and also optional five grams of product powder number one here's a hack for you you want to spend any money on that go to a local butcher that makes sausage and ask them if they can spare you just five grams of frog powder for a humble home sausage maker get the little whisk until combined and then add three quarters of a cup or 180 milliliters of filtered ice water whisk that together and you got a thick spice paste add that to your meat mixture and mix until thoroughly combined and homogeneous now stay with me here i know this is uh more expensive up front get some sheep casings and you'll need enough to handle about six pounds of meat here again you could probably barter this also off that butcher if you don't want to pay for a full bag be sure to let those rest in cold water for 30 minutes prior to using them and flush them with water then just pop them on a ah forgot about this a sausage stuffer same part for that 50 grinder but if you don't have one well look this is a bottleneck for most people get the lame store-bought hot dogs if you have to get your casings onto your sausage stuffer and well stuff your sausages until all your meat has been used pinch along that whole sausage to create about seven to eight inch logs twist them each to tighten them and repeat with the rest this will give you a total of about 80 dogs yes 80. sure the total price ends up here for the whole recipe but that's for 80 goddang dogs now pop those in the fridge uncovered overnight to dry make your merry way to a quick little sweet pickle relish first get yourself two pounds or 900 grams of pickling cucumber finely chop them do the same to half of a sweet onion save the other half for later then add all that to a large bowl cover with two tablespoons of 40 grams of kosher salt and cover with one and a half quarts or one and a half liters of water mix that and let it sit for 25 minutes then drain your cookie boys through a fine mesh strainer lined with a clean hand towel or cheese cloth bring out as much water as you can next snag a medium sauce pot and add half a cup or 120 milliliters of water one cup or 240 milliliters of white vinegar three quarters of a cup 128 grams of granulated sugar and optionally two teaspoons or seven grams of mustard seeds bring that to a boil over medium high reduce for eight minutes then add your cucumber onion mix reduce the heat to low simmer for 10 minutes then just pour all that into a bowl set over an ice bath and stir until chilled then just pour that into an airtight container and well store in your fridge next let's make your buns so where the real takeaway is combine half a cup or 125 milliliters of whole milk and half a cup or 125 milliliters of water heat it to 95 fahrenheit then whisk in two and a half teaspoons or nine grams of instant yeast till dissolved then whisk in one egg and one egg yolk then in a separate bowl magically already holding three and a half cups or 525 grams of all-purpose flour add four tablespoons or 50 grams of granulated sugar one and a half teaspoons or nine grams of fine sea salt give that a nice little so combined add your milky yeasties to the bowl of a stand mixer or just a large bowl begin mixing on low speed by machine with the dough hook attached or by hand with a fork add your flour a quarter at a time till all that's been added then once you get a rough dough mix and knead that for three minutes then add two and a half tablespoons or 35 grams of softened unsalted butter or if you're doing it by hand it's a little easier with vegetable oil it'll break up a bit it's gonna be annoying but just keep mixing until it comes back together and knead for another two minutes once it's smooth and lovely form that into a doit ball place in a greased bowl cover with plastic wrap obviously properly named rise at room temp for one hour or till doubled and puffed divide that into 80 gram pieces which will get you about 11 to 12 buns gently roll those into light balls and then roll them into sausage shapes about five inches long place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and be sure to lay them side by side so that their long sides are nearly touching and spaced about a half an inch apart once you've done that with all your dough cover that lightly with greased plastic wrap or another inverted baking sheet and proof for 30 minutes at room temp finally brush those with egg wash consisting of one egg beaten with a splash of water and bake at 375 fahrenheit for 15-18 minutes or until a lovely golden brown puffed cylinder of flavor is removed optionally you can brush those with butter but for the sake of butt cheaper maybe don't do that and let those cool completely back to our dogs you can finish these one of two ways you can either smoke them at 250 fahrenheit for about 45 minutes or till an internal temperature of 150 fahrenheit is reached or you just pop them in your oven at 250 or 275 for the same amount of time just be sure to put them on a wire rack set over a baking sheet once they're done immediately submerge them in a nice bath to cool completely and stop the cooking process once they're chilled snip them free of their meaty shackles and you have hot dogs ready to be bagged refrigerated frozen or used immediately now we're almost there let's just saute that other half of the onion grab that bad boy dice it get a medium-sized skillet heat up enough vegetable oil to cook the bottom of the pan heat that over medium-high add in your onion season a taste of salt and sear stirring often until just softened and lightly browned that's it that's the onyo now we are finally ready to assemble cook your hot dogs however you want all right just please don't boil them the idea of hot dog water existing is something that haunts me every single day instead you can easily just sear them in a pan that's been heated over medium high lightly greased plop in your dogs for two minutes or two lightly browned flip in another two to three minutes on the other side now for your buns carefully cut the rounded cheeks on both sides so you get two flat surfaces perfect for toasting get a large pan heat that over medium heat add in vegetable oil or a couple knobs of butter once that's hot add your buns flat side down and toast for one to two minutes per side or until you get a stunning golden brown now split your buns for everyone to see add in one slice of cheddar or whatever cheese you got laying around melt that under a broiler in my case a torch lay in a dog or if you want that tongue twister washing machine run on hot spin cycle double glizzy action you can add in a second dog then follow that with a layer of ketchup along the whole length of that liner followed by mustard and most importantly mayo yep don't question me here this is important now finally a little bit of your sweet relish your sauteed onion and that is a hot dog that would be served at the stands sitting at the glistening gates of mount olympus handed directly to you from a demi-god now let's taste test and see if our efforts were worthwhile here look at that that's a double dog tell me you don't want to eat that if i received this at a stadium i wouldn't even want to watch the game all i would want to do is make love to this i don't care if there are people around me i'm making love to it who was she sitting on the mayo was that you kendrick you need to come eat this just take a bite as you would it's good god it's so good it's not really about the mayo per se it's more so what it creates it's essentially a burger sauce with cheese relish onion the texture of the bread the sweetness from the bread everything you want in a bite and for this price right here that's butt cheaper you want to know what else will give you the double dog action b-roll [Music] well we got dang did it look at that the takeaway here is that a hot dog is not just a hot dog it's a piece of american culture and if you treat it with respect instead of being so god dang lazy with it well then it's quite the eating experience could you go and buy your own dogs of course it only marginally increases the price but it dramatically decreases flavor and experience that you'll be eating so think about that next time so with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time bam right out of the park you stupid [Music] [Music] you

we're on the street probably in the most hated area by all new yorkers but we had to come here to visit joe's one of the most iconic new york pizza shops we're gonna go there with my friend cam vicar might have your slice young man this is smart this is a good idea wouldn't it be awful if you just fell through this yeah that's honestly my worst fear joe's pizza one of the places that started it all and i have one of my very good friends cameron with me he's chefing it up in new york now this isn't about neapolitan pizza this is about new york pizza look at this never ever eat a new york slice of pizza like this you'll get the sh beaten out of you you have to fold it it's a little difficult to eat to be frank with the classic new york screaming anger this is gonna go well it's got the chew it's got the crisp that you want but what i noticed about this is the sauce is actually pretty sweet if you did sauce like this in italy they would pick you up buy your coat and throw you into the air and blast you with a cannon of sauce but in new york for some reason it's okay i like it long story short first stop big w the crust is iconically itself on to the next next up we're at two bros pizzas visually this one isn't as exciting to me the other one was bigger and it seemed cheesier that's a classic this is like chucky cheese pizza you don't want another bite after that there's certain aspects i like better but generally i don't like it better than the last one so you have it right here cam said he does not like it the crust is not crisp it's a lot thicker like a cakey the sauce is really sweet like ketchup long story short i'm getting an idea of what new york pizza is i'll put it in my brain we have one more spot to go to after this so we're at scars so far this is like the best looking one i heard they're milling some of their own flower and yet they're keeping the price similar if not the same as joe's joe's but a ketchup bell oh man of course this guy's gonna pull over right here this is the one this is what i needed i do want to note we did get one slice of sicilian not related to this i just really wanted it so try to ignore that but this pizza out of all the three that we've tried miles miles above the rest this is the marker i've had a lot of new york pizza this is actually one of the best slices i have had scars pizza you're doing it right thank you for that let's go back see if we can do this we're back in the kitchen uh have we ever left who knows here's the jw summary number one joe's not bad a traditional new york pizza nothing wrong there number two two brothers it's cheap pizza not my favorite personally and the third scars which is now one of my favorites very very good so we have all the knowledge it's encapsulated let's put that together and make the closest new york pizza that we can at home so with all that being said let's make this shall we this pizza is shockingly easy so let's get to it first thing the dough the heart and soul to your pizza if you think that it's not important then you need to go to like a psychiatrist it's easy to a large bowl add 950 grams of all-purpose flour uh oh josh you're using grams again yep this is pizza it's too important to be anything but accurate you want a perfect dough each time with no mistake use grams to that add 19 grams of fine sea salt and 25 grams of granulated sugar yes we're using sugar in the dough public apology to the italians watching this but please understand this is new york not italian pizza give it a whisk until combined then separately find yourself 617 grams of lukewarm water around 95 fahrenheit ideally water from new york you can get it shipped out but do so at your own risk because you don't know where that water comes from now whisk in 14 grams of instant yeast till dissolved add all of your yeast juice to your flour mix and mix by hand until you get a rough dough it'll be a little sticky but do your best to knead that bad boy for about four minutes or until you get a relatively smooth boil generously grease a large bowl with olive oil shape your dough into a toit ball pop it into your bowl cover with greased plastic wrap and rise in the fridge overnight this is a crucial step to develop that nice pizza crust flavor and color from there gently punch down your little man respectfully plop onto a lightly floured work surface and divide into pieces weighing about 300 grams each roll each of those pieces into a light bulb placed into a lightly floured proofing box or a rimmed baking sheet leaving room in between each to account for you know spread cover that with a lid or grease plastic wrap and let it proof for two to three hours at room temp or till doubled in size now while that's proofing i'm gonna spin around in circles tap your toe no we're making tomato sauce again this is very against the jw grain for tomato sauce but hear me out in medium sauce pot add two tablespoons or 24 grams of extra virgin olive oil four cloves of garlic thinly sliced three and a half tablespoons are 49 grams of unsalted butter let that mountain booble cook string occasionally until the garlic begins to toast to a nice light golden brown then add 1 teaspoon or 2 grams of crushed red pepper flakes saute for 20 seconds then add a 28 ounce can of crushed san marzano tomatoes plus about a cup or 240 milliliters of water swirled around in that can you know getting all that loosened up stir that together add one tablespoon or 13 grams of granulated sugar then add one teaspoon and one gram of dried thyme and one and a half teaspoons or two grams of dried oregano or oregano if you're from uk sorry i had to call it out season taste lightly with salt and finally add one yellow onion skinned and cut in half leaving the root attached you know you take the root off it's gonna fall apart in there all right is that what you want bring that up to a simmer and cook that down stirring occasionally for 20 minutes then just remove the soggy onion that so kindly relinquished its flavor into the sauce adjust your salt levels as needed let that cool completely and that is your sauce that smells a little like a new york pizza shop all in one little spot right so baking a pizza we've had this talk before you can either use a home oven with a baking steel or pizza stone inside which will be preheated to the maximum temp your oven goes all right not oh i'm gonna do 375 no the maximum your oven goes for at least one hour prior to baking or you know you could use an actual pizza oven go figure if you're using a pizza oven you want that around 650 degrees fahrenheit which is just a little lower than neapolitan and for a very specific reason right big time take one of your dough rounds generously flour with all-purpose and begin punching out a very thin perimeter in the dough drape the dough over your hands or fists in this case you know we're gonna beat it up a little bit and shipping it around the entire perimeter of the dough lightly stretching it as you go until you get a pizza around about 10 to 12 inches wide lay it back down place a few tablespoons of your cooled sauce in the center spread it around in a circular motion once it's spread edge to edge leaving a little bit of a border that's the crust if it's not evident top with a generous amount and by generous to your heart's desire of grated low moisture mozzarella or mozzarella depending on where you live in grand total for all these pizzas you'll need about one and a half pounds or 680 grams of that mozzarella and please fresh grate your mozzarella i'm tired of saying it no pre-grated stuff okay once the pie hits your eye pop it in your oven or pizza oven if you're fancy and for that home oven expect a bake time of about six to eight minutes or if you're in a pizza oven it'll be about two to four minutes instead be sure to rotate the pizza 180 degrees halfway through its cooking process so it cooks evenly then once it's done you should pull out a bubbling round beauty lightly puffed around the crust burnished in random spots and that classic new york cheese grease laying right atop the center so beautifully glistening you could practically see yourself like it's a mirror of your own mistakes about to be made now repeat with the rest of your pies and yes this makes a lot so feel free to refrigerate the dough balls for up to two days if you don't want to make all of them in one go but more importantly let's cut this beauty up and taste to see how close we truly got we got pizza new york style it's not terribly different from the neapolitan it's just a lower temperature longer period of time but the main focus is the sauce the cheese and of course the [Music] and also it does in fact fold kinda smells like coffee what's wrong with that vikram vikram doesn't drink coffee roast him in the comments let's go i'll just eat this pizza we get a little sense of new york now hang on pause i already know the new yorkers are watching this i know what you're saying that's not a new york pizza josh oh it's not thin enough this is merely an example okay i think to me flavor-wise the profile that i'm getting from this pizza reminds me so much of that new york slice that we had but if you really want new york pizza and you want it to be as best as possible go to new york but if you don't have time

Amboy Collab RSVP: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/joshua-weissman-x-alvin-cailan-burger-collab...",2022-11-27 21:59:44.386764, donuts come from many places but there's an iconic one that everybody needs to try and it comes from a place called new orleans [Music] we recently hit 6 million subscribers as you know a massive thank you and we have a special coming for that i promise but in the meantime listen up los angeles at amboy april 1st 5 pm we're gonna be dishing out a special burger the world has never seen for all of you to come try taste meet me i'll be slanging burgers signing books seeing you kissing babies maybe not the last part why do they do that if you want to go visit the link in the description rsvp totally free to do that and i will see you there you come to new orleans as i said we just landed we're trying three different beignets all their different accompanying stories try them and then make them let's begin so we're starting things off right in the french quarter at a place that i think you cannot come to new orleans without stopping at least two three times and what is the name of it cafe du mont oldest living beignets if not the oldest is it the first 1862 throwback cafe ole you guys know how i feel about coffee it's made with chicory jesus christ it is so god we just screwed this entire shoe oh my god vikram that is the hottest coffee i've ever put in my mouth okay oh these bennies look bad fried fresh already powdered sugar on the ground and that was there before i even took my first bite i will say not as fluffy as i expected but it's rich it's sweet you got the powdered sugars all over your lips and your mouth and falling and it's like where has he been a wall street party in the bathroom or did he just eat a beignet these are a little tougher than i imagined and i don't know maybe it's an optic i don't want to be mean about it i know that a lot of people have this close to heart so respect to that they say pillowy but i would think i'd rather have a pillow from prison but it's almost like a funnel cake type though this is a good first impression but let's move on to the next one right so just a ten minute walk away from cafe dumont and where do we end up a beautiful place loretta's pralines this is a classic new orleans place if you don't come here you're making a very very big mistake and they opened up just for us so that we could try their twist to the classic beignet they take a classic beignet and then they stuff them with praline now if that doesn't get your pants all pulled up and ready to have goddamn tango i don't know what i could do for you okay so we are officially inside the coveted loretta's tasha thank you so much for having us seriously it means the world to me that you would open up your doors can you tell us a little bit about yourself and what you do here so i'm loretta's niece unfortunately miss loretta passed away so i have taken over as the ceo of the business she was the first african-american female to start a praline business here she worked for a local library and she would make the candy everybody loved it she used to sell maybe about 1500 candies a day she had a cart and that brought us here 1500 candies a day she was working and you said probably right it's a problem okay not a praline i literally gave us two different takes outside because i was like i'm scared don't say praline here i'm not here is it pecan or pecan it is a pecan so a proline is a sweet candy creamy chunky piece of new orleans the heart wants what the heart wants i want that one that specific one right there you're too good to me i don't deserve it smells very good oh my god you kidding me there's a reason why they're the best this is the most balanced texturally sound best prawn i've ever put in my mouth and i'm not just saying that for the camera i'm not just saying sure i swear if i came here by myself my first opinion would be like people need to know about this and they already do and for good reason we're the best you really are the best and we know that this is a one of a kind i would love to be walked through this process with you i'm going with this so we use our copper kettles milk butter and sugar we let it cook about 20 minutes and then i'm going to add my pecans i didn't hear a thing i was lost it was like violence playing now you see why she quit that library job right oh yes mr jerry comes in he gets the dough preps it puts it in the fridge ready for them to go you pop them in the fryer there's a layering to it in a way i'm pretty sure you had cafe du monde theirs is more of a dough ours are more crispy we give them their props thanks for starting it loretta's will take it over okay we will take it over i'm entranced by this right now so this is our proline filling nice and crisp so not only are you getting the proline filling but you're also getting the pauline icing drop it off without sugar oh my gosh this is the best day of my life uh mom if you're watching you deserve this more than i do i promise to bring you back here i'm so sorry floating away it is so light unbelievable my god i'm not a good actor i'm very bad at lying so we know they're good we're trying to take beignets to the next level you already did oh my gosh i don't even want to go to any other beignet place any longer it's just the truth this is the best beignet i've ever had thank you so much loretta has done something incredible at the end of the day this is about food but it's also about the culture and she's hit every single layer and she's done it with excellence if you're coming to new orleans and you don't come here you're not my friend you're not his friend so we have fluffy beignets and crispy flaky beignets we're gonna go for something in between crisp on the outside but fluffier and airier than a goddamn cumulus cloud and while we do have traditional sweet we also have a loretta's inspired savory beignet for the dough mix together three quarters of a cup or 180 grams of water and half a cup or 122 grams of whole milk heat that to 95 fahrenheit then whisk in 2 teaspoons or 6 grams of instant yeast till just dissolve this oh and also a quarter cup or 60 grams of granulated sugar now snag yourself a bowl of three and a half cups or 525 grams of all-purpose flour and to that you'll add one teaspoon or six grams of fine sea salt and half a teaspoon or two grams of add one egg yolk and one whole egg whisk together until combined then while constantly whisking slowly stream in three tablespoons or 42 grams of melted unsalted butter full pause i've said this many a time there are little yeasty boys in there getting to work cranking down to provide your dough aeration please don't kill all of them with scalding hot butter make sure that it's no more than 100 degrees fahrenheit by the time that it goes in there now add your liquid to your stand mixer pop on your spiral hook turn that bad boy on to medium low and add your flour in at two tablespoon increments until all your flour has been added and you have a rough dough now just knead that brother till the cows come home for about three to five minutes and the dough is smooth and supple greasy medium sized bowl roll your little man into a toit ball pop them in there cover with plastic wrap and of course give it a proper name then rise at room temperature for two hours or until doubled look at him full of air joy happiness and just shh it's okay you're at peace once you've punched all the air out dump onto a lightly floured work surface adjusted it with flour and roll it out until you get an evenly sized rectangle that's about a quarter of an inch thick yes real thin then just cut that into two by two inch squares you'll first start by cutting two inch wide long strips all the way down your dough and yep you guessed it you'll cut across these strips at two inch intervals to get well two by two squares now depending on how good your rolling and your cuts are you can really maximize the amount of squares but at a minimum you'll get 40 to 45. any scrap dough you can push together rest for 10 minutes and of course roll back out now place each of your cut squares on baking sheets lined with parchment paper cover them with plastic wrap and rest for about five minutes there's no proof time required these actually fry a lot nicer without it so get yourself a seven quart pot filled with about three quarts of vegetable oil for frying heat it to 330 degrees fahrenheit then add in as many squares as you can without overcrowding and be sure to leave room to account for their rise now fry those bad boys flipping occasionally to color both sides about two to three minutes or until beautiful light golden brown beignets emerge filling your house with the scent of fragrant sweet beignet frozen batches treating them on paper towels as they finish and to serve while they're still hot generously dust them with powdered sugar if they're not hot when you dust them with powdered sugar it will not stick and when i say generous i mean generous now for the king crab version in a large bowl add a quarter cup or 56 grams of creme fraiche a quarter cup or 52 grams of mayonnaise 2 teaspoons or 10 grams of dijon mustard 2 cloves of garlic grated 2 teaspoons or 12 grams of worcestershire sauce which set together till combined and homogeneous add in one root of celery finely diced half a bunch of chives very thinly sliced salt and pepper to taste the zest from one lemon and of course lemon juice to taste for the crab you'll need one whole cluster of king crab which is usually three to four pieces don't ask me where the fourth piece went here okay i don't know to break that down separate each segment open up one end of a segment and this is my little secret with that open segment tap that forcefully on your hand and bing bang bam it should quite literally launch out of the shell i prefer to do it this way it's faster but takes practice once you have all your meat pulled out cut it into half inch chunks add all that to your crumb fresh mayo mixture and gently fold together give that a taste test make sure the salt levels are good now to assemble this one simply grab a fresh fried beignet still nice and warm cut it open on one side like a pocket and stuff that bad boy generously with your king crab salad fill up as many as you like pop them on a nice plate and just like the powdered sugar generously grate on some fresh parmesan reggiano finished with a little bit of sliced chive and fresh cracked black pepper that has to be one of the most luxurious looking beignets i've seen it's almost like a mix of a donut and a lobster roll can't complain now without further adieu let's pound these beignets and see how we did a massive thank you to new orleans for being so kind to us the culture the people the incredible food being made new orleans is really everything it's cracked up to be and more so from us to new orleans thank you we will be back in town soon [Applause] [Music] what it's what's wrong with that i'm just existing my apologies right so we have two beignets here i'm sure there are people like oh my god i can't do a savory beignet shut up okay they do it at loretta's that means it's okay you understand we'll start off with mr traditional first off the interior the fluff the aeration there's a big argument should it be crispy should it be fluffy this thin hemisphere is crisp but the interior is like a cloud it almost floats into your mouth it's a very good beignet now the savory one a little more sacrilege but also not really before i even get into it this is hands down a delectable little bite no matter how you look at it whether it's a bengay or not the flavors the texture it's aerated it's beautiful you have everything that you want from a beignet but it's stuffed full of a king crab salad topped with parmesan what more do you want not only are these worthy of love worthy of enjoying worthy of sharing with your family friends sitting down crying laughing farting it doesn't matter because we did the research and this was born and i want to give birth you want to know what else is covered in a mountain of papa's powder b-roll [Music] wow a good time in new orleans thank you loretta's the beignets came out fantastic i feel good about it do they live up to loretta's well they're different but they're still delicious if you want to make them at home you don't have time to new orleans you know what to do but with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or you

and this time is no different [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] stop this is one of the most important episodes of butt better in history because it's the 69th and we just hit 6 million subscribers a massive thank you and we have a big special coming for that I promise but in the meantime to celebrate I will see you in Los Angeles April 1st 5 p.m where servant burgers at Amboy the link is in the description I'll see you there so back to the score data crunch okay so today we're making the Cheesy Gordita Crunch what a mouthful and it also visually is an eyeful or an eyesore really I don't know what it is with Taco Bell I'm putting things in other things they got their quesarito it's like a burrito in a quesadilla and then they're like oh what if we make another quesadilla and then put a crunchy taco in there they're basically trying to figure out how to put literally anything in a quesadilla next thing it's gonna be iPhone for free and of quesadilla stop you don't need to compensate for your food it's bad just accept what it is so with all that being said let's make this shall we yeah Kentucky Taco yeah since it has two I'll give the location a 2 out of ten I already know what's on the menu at menu rating 5 out of ten oh the nacho fries are back look at that hi can I get two Cheesy Gordita Crunch no that's it all right thank you yeah that service is getting a 9 out of ten the guy's on his shirt I love that I didn't even inhale to say my first word and he was already like okay yeah no problem all right done love you bye thank you so much appreciate it holy  that was fast that was faster than McDonald's we were in and out of there in 30 seconds 10 out of 10 service wow is it hot how did they do that do they just have them sitting there I don't know how that's possible I genuinely do not know how that is possible so we got yo the colonel owns Taco Bell now I guess this feels nothing like I would imagine this is what it's supposed to look like and that's what it actually looks like this is the cheese that they put on there someone complained about me spitting out food being a waste of food so I swallowed it there's zero flavor to this whatsoever the texture I actually kind of like right the soft the crunch the lettuce is zero flavor at this point this is just an onslaught it's just in a matter of winning or losing this is a matter of how hard do I want to spank them and it's going to be hard let me tell you shockingly this is easier than you think we have a flatbread it's really just my tortilla dough rolled thicker ancho ranch or ancho Rancho you will sorry taco shells and of course our beef let's start with the ground beef the easy easiest culinary cop-out in the world and usually disappointing not this one start with a medium sauce pot set of a medium high add one pound or 450 grams of fatty ground beef you really want this underneath 80 lean but you know get what you got press it out so it's nice and flat let it sear for three minutes get some good color flip and sear three more minutes then using a handheld Masher mash it up till it gets as fine as possible then let it cook and fry for three to five minutes stirring often until cooked through and you get beautiful little crispy bits it's like meaty diamonds twinkling with crunch then add half a teaspoon or one gram of onion powder one tablespoon or nine grams of garlic powder two teaspoons or four grams of ancho powder half a teaspoon or one gram of ground cinnamon stir together and a lot of toast for two seconds then add three and a half tablespoons or 65 grams of tomato paste stir that in until completely coating the beef and finally add in one and a half cups or 350 milliliters of beef broth toss in two bay leaves bring to a boil over medium high reduce the heat to low and simmer and reduce for 30 to 40 minutes or until almost all the liquid is gone and you're left with a condensed flavor care package then just cut the heat toss in two cloves of finely chopped garlic mix together till fragrant that's your beef doesn't taste like poopy now like I've said instead of standing and picking your nose during the 40 minute simmer time you'll make your flatbread in a medium-sized Bowl add two cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon or 4 grams of fine sea salt half a teaspoon or 2 grams of baking powder whisk together until combined then separately mix in a tiny little pinch of instant yeast into three quarters of a cup or 180 milliliters of warm water it's around 100 degrees Fahrenheit once dissolved add a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of vegetable oil mixed together obviously it's not going to stay mixed right we all remember science class now add that to your flour mix with a fork to get a Shaggy dough then need by hand for four to five minutes or until you get a smooth Supple Dome grab a plastic wrap and rest for 30 minutes as we wait for the ancho Ranch in medium-sized Bowl add 1 cup of 208 grams of mayo a quarter cup or 55 grams of creme fraiche a quarter teaspoon or one gram of onion powder 2 teaspoons or 4 grams of ancho powder 1 red Fresno chili finely chopped a quarter cup or 14 grams of fresh cilantro finely chopped three sprigs of Dill finely chopped three cloves of garlic grated salty peppy to taste two tablespoons or 30 grams of hot sauce of your choice Cholula is the way you want to go a third cup or 80 of Buttermilk together back of a spoon so well it's like it has separation anxiety now back to our flatbread plop your dough onto a work surface separate it into 70 gram pieces roll into light balls then Dust with flour press them out to get a disc and roll with a rolling pin until you get roughly an eight inch disc it's about a third of an inch thick or even slightly thicker this is cooked like all my other tortilla recipes ripping hot cast iron pan that's been heated over medium-high until hotter than me in a mini skirt and thigh-high boots plop in a flatbread and let it cook for 20 seconds or until you start to get some bubbles in light Char flip and repeat for another 20 to 30 seconds and place it on towel stacking them as you go and repeat with all of your dough it's kind of like an in-between of non and a tortilla it's a beautiful thing actually I kind of like this right we're nearly ready to assemble so onto the taco shells which is literally just 350 degree frying oil canola or vegetable is fine or avocado if you want to drop 100 on this and well you just fry your corn tortillas in that now to get the shape you can either fry and fold them with tongs and hold them in the oil till it holds that shape or you can use a taco shell shaper yes they exist these were pretty good and fun fact at my very first book signing I actually met the family that created this which they came all the way out out just to thank me saying that you guys helped his family quite a bit by going and grabbing these shout out to that guy and his family very sweet story and you know shout out to y'all for being so supportive anyway Friday's guys to light golden brown and crisp about two to three minutes remove and drain on a wire rack being sure to Salt immediately while they're still hot if you want the Doritos Locos version all you gotta do is use this seasoning from my Doritos Locos video link in the description for that while they're still hot and well look at that and yes we'll taste test both of these don't you worry right assembly time for accoutrement you want half a head of iceberg thinly sliced half a sweet onion very thinly sliced on a mandolin now optionally but highly recommended if you really care about anything experience you can place that onion in a bowl cover with a wire rack and fill with water let it run for about a minute and after you'll have beautifully crisp sweet onion that has all the nice luxurious flavors without the abrasive spice and sulfuric onion flavor cheese makes it easy 50 50 mix of one and a half cups or 84 grams of grated cheddar and the exact same amount in Monterey Jack also graded tossed together and that's your flamage okay here we go to bring this all together lay down your flatbread cook the entire surface with cheese like a pizza brush it lightly with a torch or pop under the broiler until the cheese is completely melted and hot immediately place your taco shell in the center and then bring the sides together gently holding it until it adheres which takes a solid 15 to 25 seconds release then add your meat in the center evenly spread out as little or as much as you like a nice sport of your ancho Ranch a handful of thinly sliced onion a fat stack of refreshing Iceberg and a little sprinkle of your cheese on top look I hate cold cheese on these tacos but that's how they do it all right don't ask me why keeping it consistent here now it's time for the all-important taste test to decide which the winner is here but visually I mean come on this is just sad I mean we might as well just say we've won right this is everything Taco Bell wanted to be the crunch the flavor it's like punching you in the mouth this is a win Doritos that is significantly better Doritos Loco 100 big dub we won but we need our taste tester how are you feeling about this I like Taco Bell first like oh God number two I obviously picked number one there is an amount of flavor here that is just non-existent in this one I can taste every little bit of every ingredient in here the juicy wonderful meat and then the softness of this flatbread tortilla thing this is nothing they're supposed to be cheese here it's nothing you're scary it's nothing Kendrick you already here we're the winners yet again Taco Bell never stood a chance you want to know what else always stands a chance overall [Music] [Music] s

so again thank you to capital one for sponsoring today's video now on to le poulet right so this is korean fried chicken versus american fried chicken it almost seems like there's a fried chicken for just about every single place in the world you got japanese fried chicken korean fried chicken american fried chicken and then there's different kinds of fried chicken depending on where you go in america i could go on and on about it what is the ideal fried chicken is there a better eating experience a better flavor crunch so as you two go head to head we'll give you the answer that being said let's make this shall we we got two avenues here so we're gonna explore both at the same time one of these chickens are marinated and one of them is sort of dry cured but either way we'll get them to coat nicely in their dredge let's begin with our korean fried chicken also called yangnyum chicken that's my pronunciation can't wait to be eviscerated in the comments anyway very simple start with 2 pounds or 900 grams of chicken pieces you can go with wings drumsticks thighs or a nice mix to that you'll add 1 tablespoon or 17 grams of grated ginger 1 teaspoon or half a gram of fine ground black pepper generous salt to taste and just toss that bad boy together and let it sit for at least five minutes at room temp or covered in the fridge overnight so this is essentially curing in a way now for the buttermilk fried chicken you're gonna want the same exact amount of chicken added to a buttermilk marinade consisting of 2 cups or 475 milliliters of buttermilk 1.5 teaspoons or 8 grams of optional [Music] sorry to break your heart but it's completely fine to eat 1 tablespoon or 12 grams of kosher salt 1 tablespoon or nine grams of ground white pepper one tablespoon or twelve grams of garlic powder one tablespoon or nine grams of smoked paprika whisk together till combined and homogeneous add the same amount of chicken of choice make sure it's completely submerged let it sit at room temp for five minutes or in the fridge covered overnight now here's our two chickens side by side already looking completely different but equally beautiful now let's take a look at the two different kinds of dredge for the korean fried chicken it's simply one cup or 165 grams of cornstarch and a quarter teaspoon or half a gram of baking soda whisk it together and that's it now for the southern style there's a lot more ingredients it'll be two and a half cups or 375 grams of all-purpose flour two teaspoons or two grams of dried thyme one tablespoon or 12 grams of garlic powder one teaspoon or three grams of onion powder two teaspoons or five grams of celery powder which phonetically sounds terrible 2 tablespoons or 18 grams of smoked paprika 2 teaspoons or 10 grams of msg and 2 tablespoons or 23 grams of kosher salt give that a whisk and that is your dredge i know wow oh this other one has way too many ingredients look that's the point it's got a spice kick right in your goddang drawls now the korean one seems light on flavor so far or so you'd think you see the flavor for the korean fried chicken will be added after cooking with a sauce consisting of half a cup or 160 grams of gochujang six tablespoons or 104 grams of ketchup a quarter cup or 50 grams of soy sauce five tablespoons or 160 grams of brown rice vinegar a quarter cup or 60 grams of mirin six tablespoons or 46 grams of palm sugar or light brown sugar if you don't want to be a true culinarian added to a pot whistle homogenous and heat it over medium heat just until it begins to simmer and let that brother reduce for only one minute immediately cut off the heat and mix in eight cloves of finely chopped garlic yes eight cloves all the quirky quotes of oh two cloves of garlic isn't enough is this enough for you karen cause now you gotta commit to the bit jokes aside uh please do not cut back on this garlic ratio it's what makes it extra special okay the time to fry has come the frying process here are completely different so pay close attention for the korean fried chicken gently toss in the cornstarch mix and aggressively press the dredge into every nook and cranny until the wet spots are dry shake off the excess and place into fry oil that's been preheated to 325 fahrenheit and you'll probably want to do this in two to three batches by the way let that bad boy fry for about five minutes or to cook through in light golden immediately remove and drain on a wire rack fry the rest and this is the secret here increase your oil temperature to 375 fahrenheit and place your chicken back into the fryer for one to two minutes or until a beautiful golden brown ultra wispy wafer thin crisp exterior emerges you know obviously the chicken should have been cooked through prior this is just a crispifying process now pop that into a bowl test it with as much or as little sauce as you want and make sure that that coats every square microscopic inch of this chicken leaving these korean style wings bald will unlock a satanic portal into culinary doom for which you'll have to crawl with your bare hands and nails out of so please sauce them as directed now the southern american style chicken is a little simpler add a tablespoon or two of your marinade to the seasoned dredge and toss together this is the technique that will get you those nice thin flaky bits on the fry you know what i'm talking about remove from your marinade toss in your seasoned dredge and again press that dredge aggressively into the chicken so it's completely coated then in two to three batches gently lay that chicken into a pot filled with at least two to three inches of fry oil that's been preheated to about 350 fahrenheit and fry for five to seven minutes or until you have a deep golden brown flaky crispy buttermilk fried chicken that of course has an internal temperature of 165 fahrenheit probably should mention that the same rule of 165 internal temp applies to the legs as well pal lest you want medium rare chicken now place set on a wire rack to drain and simply repeat that frying process with all of your chicken now it is the moment of truth just looking at these two you can see how extremely different the breading is and even then they both look like exotic stones retrieved from two opposite corners of the world with their own secret story and yes the korean style one may be sauced and the southern one is not is that going to make a difference my gut in a weird way says no but i think an even better judge of that would be my tongue time for a taste test wow we have two pieces of chicken let's get a smell test so this one smells nostalgic to me because this is what my mom would make this one spanks you a little bit there's a little bit of spice to it you get that first whiff and it's just kind of like what the happened so got this beautiful breading and we're going to do a sound test on that first it's one of them things you just gotta pop this just give it a good old i was going to jump and throw my ass in the air texturally the crunch the juiciness of the skin the salt levels are perfect jumping over to this i suspect we're not going to have as much of a crunch oh wow this is a hard choice i'm not sure if there's one that's better than the other in this i normally lean towards asian food in general so do i go nostalgia or do i go current favorite this one it's sweet it's sour it's acidic and it's got that peppery background note if i were to pick a favorite right now i don't think that i can so i need someone to step in and be a determiner here yeah the breading is just nostalgic always surprises you a little bit that's so good it's a tough call because like if i went to a restaurant i hadn't had drumsticks in a while wanted something different i would go for the gochujang ones but trying both i would just want both bowls make both and find out yourself thank you vikram for nothing yeah what i've learned is that it comes down to what you desire in that moment these are completely different there isn't one that's better than the other i feel like i could eat 40 of these but i feel like i could only eat two of these both styles of chicken beautifully done guess you're just gonna have to make it to find out [Applause] why the does that keep happening you want to know what else has big juicy legs carved into my mind b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our chicken but first we have to give a massive thank you to our sponsor capital one shopping thank you it's an incredibly easy way to save money when you shop online and uh it's free so remember to add the free capital one shopping extension to your browser and it will instantly search and find all the discounts you're looking for while you're shopping apply them to your cart bing bang boom you got a goddamn deal brother go to the description get it on your browser and avoid having to pay full price every single time so we have our korean fried chicken versus american fried chicken both beautifully done delicious aside from it obviously tasting different visually there are polar opposites one of them is a thick beautiful rich buttermilk flaky crust and then the other one's sort of like this thin wispy wafer-like crispity crunch it not only affects the texture it affects the flavor the way you eat it and it also affects how it satiates you which is a big part of eating i feel like my palate sort of leans towards the korean fried chicken but at the end of the day there is no winner here they're all equally delicious it just is how you prefer to have it in that moment in time when you want fried chicken when the hunger strikes so you make your goddamn decision but i hope this was somewhat helpful that

76,76,1 Dollar Gourmet Quesadilla | But Cheaper,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JtpnjfDw8Kc/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAH-5N2glyvF0E_DEEAgRfD8SQOjw,JtpnjfDw8Kc,"6 minutes, 54 seconds","Quesadillas are generally expensive when eating out…on the other hand, this completely homemade quesadilla is less than a dollar.

Amboy Burger Collab RSVP: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/joshua-we...",2022-11-27 21:59:44.386764, I get it a quesadilla is cheap but boring why don't have a gourmet version like you would get at a restaurant for this price right here that is but cheaper [Music] hey pal you live in L.A you want to try my food great Friday April 1st and boy here's the location there will be a link in the description for the location as well we'll be there from 5 PM to 9pm be there or be square now back to our quesadilla look 99.99 of the time I always recommend making your own tortillas okay but look a store-bought tortilla and the crappy shredded cheese put together in a pan has this weird Nostalgia for me I don't know why probably because of my childhood okay I ate a lot of them they're great or are they could they be a lot better with meats and different cheeses and homemade tortillas and does that make it worth it all that time and effort I think the answer is yes but we have one way to find out so let's make this shall we right so let's begin with the one we all know find your worst store-bought flour tortillas that you can find which if you properly aren't horrifying albeit still lame in comparison to homemade but feel that bad boy with any regular old pre-shredded Fiesta cheese which is a vague term that doesn't really have a definition if there is one thing I really dislike in cheese aside from Blue it's pre-shredded anti-kicking agents dry texture lackluster flavor in comparison to fresh grated but uh I digress add that to one half of your tortilla fold it over add about a tablespoon of butter then add in your folded tortilla in a non-stick pan and toast for about two minutes flip and twist for another one to two minutes it's a finished quesadilla beautifully fast surprisingly nice cheese bowl and well it's unfussy to make but dude tastes this bad boy in a second but only alongside our much more Gourmet version all for this price right here to make that we must first begin with our tortillas it's simple and it totals out of this price for eight Big Boy tortillas but you could always make them smaller and have more in a medium-sized Bowl add two cups or 330 grams of all-purpose flour and one teaspoon or 4 grams of fine sea salt half a teaspoon or two grams of baking powder whisk together until combined separately add a quarter cup or 62 grams of vegetable oil now stop well Josh why don't we add lard if you know anything about the tortilla world please stop yourself the oil helps add a ton of very desirable chew so don't substitute this thinking you're being smart love you now mix that into three quarters of a cup or 180 milliliters of hot water then mix that into your flour mixture stirring with a fork until you get a rough dough then just need by hand for two to three minutes until you get a cover that with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes oh and uh don't forget to give it some life very nice Josh now cooking the tortillas is even easier heat up a large cast iron skillet dry over medium-high heat this isn't hot enough you are going to get the opposite of a kiss now separate your dough into eight even pieces roll those pieces until it get circles about nine inches wide and it's a little under a quarter inch thick so it should be quite thin jelly lay a tortilla into your hot pan let it cook and Char for about 15 seconds if it's hot enough and reminder then flip and let it finish for another 15 to 20 seconds on the other side place in a towel to keep warm and repeat with all of your lovely tortillas and now for the filling let's make this easy heat a medium sized cast iron pan until hotter than me dancing with very tight pants on add a half cup or 227 grams of high fat ground beef that means something that's like less than 80 lean we want the fat okay cook and mash that stirring occasionally for four minutes or until the beef has rendered out its fat is fully cooked and starting to develop little crispy boys like this then add three cloves of garlic thinly sliced one jalapeno diced half a yellow onion diced then season them taste with salt and pepper and saute until the vegetables are softened and starting to carry caramelize about three minutes make sure those salt levels are nice and then you have your buff for the sauce simply mix a quarter cup of 55 grams of sour cream a quarter cup or 55 grams of salsa verde or any salsa of choice really this is actually a recipe from another video which you can find the link in the description and a half cup or 30 grams of very friendly chopped cilantro season that lightly with salt and that's your salsa Crema now last but far from least the cheese mix in a bowl mixed together two cups are 120 grams of grated cheddar cheese and one cup or 60 grams of grated monterey jack tostas toss and that's your cheese mix see very simple now assembling is the same take one of your homemade tortillas opened up flat and on one side add a couple spoonfuls of your salsa Crema spread it around on just half then a small layer of cheese followed by a small layer of beef and you guessed it another layer of cheese you should always double cheese it's a quesadilla okay then fold it into a half moon add a tablespoon of unsalted butter to a non-stick pan a different medium heat let it melt and once it's hot and add in your quesadilla and let it toast for about two minutes flip and toast for another two minutes until all of your cheese is melted and you got a beautifully browned quesadilla pop it out cut it and experience a cheese pull that opens up the spreads of time you can nearly look through it and see the happiness of your future self it's a beautiful thing now let's actually taste this and see if it far surpasses the value of the OG quesadillo right so we have two different versions this is not about better it's just a comparison of two cheap versions one more Gourmet all handmade and one that's just kind of store-bought put together this one right here and then this one visually the homemade tortilla looks artisanal it's got that sort of crusty it almost looks like a really nice flat bread this one is much more crisp don't believe me so there's this version honestly there's a certain level of nostalgia to that right we all know that store-bought flower tortilla flavor it just goes so well with the crappy pre-grated cheese now [Music] I don't care what anyone says the flavor increase is so dramatically larger there is no comparison whatsoever if you want something different that is worth remembering and making again this is the quesadilla for you for this price right here that is a proper but cheaper Gourmet quesadilla brother you wonder what else gets my cheese oozing b-roll [Music] okay so we made our two different quesadillas of course the original one still tasted good I'm not here to tell you that that doesn't taste good so before you get in the comments oh my God Josh I really like it when I make it like that I'm not sure I remember I don't give a sh don't go in the corner I bet your wall smells like old stale cheese but the alternative version that we made that was so much more in flavor depth meaning heart and for still a low price are you kidding me brother so if you have passion love left in you after all these years then you're going to want to make that quesadilla take it or leave it pal foreign [Music] [Music]

Additional Cookbook Options...",2022-11-27 21:59:44.386764, this isn't a soup it's not a rice bowl not a noodle bowl this is an eating experience of a lifetime [Music] so today we're making hot pot heavily misunderstood and oftentimes i feel like people just don't take the time to go and try it why the beauty of hot pot is you got your bra oftentimes there's two there's a spicy and a regular and you have all sorts of accoutrements you can mix and match however you want and i've said this before i'm single-handedly one of the most indecisive diners you can possibly imagine i will order far more than i need and spend far more than i have to just so i can try everything it's its own problem but this dish single-handedly solves that for me and it'll solve it for you too so let's make this shall we okay i don't want you getting your pants all in a bunch and think this is gonna be super complicated there's a lot of ingredients but we can simplify it here basically this consists of two broths a very clean and light tasting broth on one side and a nice umami rich and beautifully spicy version on the other then you have a multitude of acoutremo and dipping sauces to create an eating experience unique to you and your heart speaking of that let's begin with the heart of this recipe the stock we're keeping this basic okay no salt yet this is just the base of the recipe to a stockpot add five large chicken drumsticks and five large bone in and skin on chicken thighs one bunch of green onion one inch numb of ginger sliced 1 whole head of garlic cut in half then add just enough water to cover and that should be at least 5 quarts bring them to a light boil over medium-high heat and reduce to a simmer then just let that lightly simmer for one and a half to 2 hours or until you get a lovely light colored stock that has a beautifully clean but flavorful taste strain that bad boy and you have a stock for the base of each soup now typically when you make each broth you'll also see a store-bought soup base more specifically for the spicy version but what about your own homemade instant soup base that just sink and boil anytime you want two blender add two tablespoons or seven grams of red sichuan peppercorns two tablespoons or seven grams of green szechuan peppercorns three star anus also pronounced anise two cinnamon sticks lightly charred with a torch or broiler gold and lightly crushed blend until as fine as possible a high speed blender like this helps a lot now in a medium soft spot add 1.5 cups for 308 grams of beef fat aka tallow half a cup of 120 milliliters of vegetable oil heat that over medium heat just until the beef fat is melted then add in 1 pint or 55 grams of dried chili pods seeded these are heaven-facing chilis but you could also use chili to arbor or dried korean chilies let this gently fry for 1-2 minutes or until beautifully crisp and lightly darkened strain the oil into a heat-proof container then place the strained oil back into the pot let the chilies cool for about 30 seconds then put them in your blender and blend their brother on high until very fine now to your warm oil add a mixture of eight cloves of finely chopped garlic five green onion sliced thin a three inch knob of ginger peeled and finely chopped then turn that on to medium heat and sweat for one minute or just until fragrant that add half a cup or 105 grams of doben jian also called spicy bean paste yes i know pronunciation blows but guess what the flavor does not three tablespoons are 65 grams of fermented black bean paste five bay leaves two tablespoons or 25 grams of dried shiitake mushroom powder which is exactly what you think dried shiitake mushrooms blended powder super easy your spice mix from earlier and once that starts to bubble add your blended fried chilies and let the cook stirring occasionally for seven to ten minutes or until it becomes a very dark red now carefully remove all your bay leaves and finally add one tablespoon or 15 grams of granulated sugar two and a half teaspoons or 11 grams of stir that in and last add three tablespoons or 35 grams of shaoxing rice wine cook for one more minute then add everything to a blender and blend until as smooth as possible at high speed i'll tell you right now you ain't gonna do much blending if it ain't on high pour that mixture into an 8x8 baking pan spread it out evenly and optionally top with a couple whole dried red chili pods this is more for visuals then cover that place it in the fridge and cool until completely solid then just divide that into four to six pieces depending on how spicy you want your soup base and that is literally an instantized soup base that really can be used in any context your heart desires mix it in rice put it in another soup melted in mashed potatoes i mean it's ridiculous tell you what believe it or not we're actually ready to assemble look this isn't but cheaper so if you want to have this thing that makes a hot pot special aka two-sided hot pot place in the middle of the family now fill both sides of your hot pot with your stock turn that bad boy onto medium high and first let's start with our non-spicy side add four dried shiitake mushrooms a pinch of ground white pepper three to four chinese jujube a two inch knob of ginger peeled and sliced four green onions sliced in two inch segments and then on the other side guess what literally just one block of your spicy soup base drop it in let it dissolve and the obelisk of flavor will do the rest then just season both sides to taste with salt from here it's real basic you need a couture that rings your binky i've got two pounds of mini bok choy cleaned and quartered some trumpet mushrooms sliced one container of beech mushrooms with their bottoms cut off napa cabbage halved and cut into large strips and for the starch we got chinese style noodles but hang on maybe you'd toss in some dumplings or mix and match and have some rice cakes you know whatever floats your soup boat for the meat you can use anything you want but i recommend getting a tray of pre-sliced shabu-shabu beef and maybe some thinly sliced wagyu beef as well typically i'll do two to three pounds for four people and you can find all this stuff at a local asian grocery store that being said last but not least very very important the dipping sauces of course spicy chili oil but also sesame garlic oil which is comprised of three tablespoons or 28 grams of sesame oil three cloves of garlic grated and a generous pinch of smoky flaky salt mix and well that's it for vinegar soy it's literally just three tablespoons or 40 grams of soy sauce mixed with three tablespoons or 40 grams of chinese black vinegar can't forget rice you know it has a home in pretty much all meals and look at that you got your veg your starch your dipping sauces meats hot steamy simmering umami rich broth ready to call the cowboys home tears of joy in your eyes and happiness welling up in your heart let's give this a little breakdown on how to eat this and see what this is truly all about wow this is one of my most favorite eating experiences it's beautiful my biggest thing is i always want to taste a bunch of things when i go out to eat oftentimes i order far more than i need to and i don't care because i want to try it all hot pot supplies all of those experiences in one there's to be at least a hundred combinations here below meeting here put it in there put me in here and then and there put me in here and then and there but then put a little noodle in there and then and there with the meat in here it's tailored to exactly what you want you should make sure every bite is different one for the meat biggest tip when you dip your meat uh when you dip your meat it needs to be quick i'm talking 15 to 20 seconds that'll keep it juicy and moist please don't leave it in there and let it get obliterated all right i got a little bit of rice the rice wasn't cooked in here but all the different ingredients are permeating the rice they're dropping their fats and their juices and their oils and their salts sort of perfuming this rice with the essence of all these hot pot flavors pretty sure rice flew out of my mouth can we get a replay if you caught that i don't know if my dumplings cooked all the way through but i hope it is so good the benefit of cooking something like a dumpling or noodles in here it absorbs all this flavor is that what we all want it is you want to know what else has meat dipped in a hot steamy bath b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our hook it's one of those things that every time you make it you're like wow this is so much better than i imagined it to be and it's not like you didn't expect it to be great it is that much better there's plenty of recipes you can make where you eat something and it's like yeah this is good it's like not blowing me away but it's like good i'm enjoying it and i would make this again but this far surpasses that only because of its customizability it's different every time you eat it there's never one hot pot meal that's exactly the same the juicy dripping meat it's spicy it's salty a little bit of sweet it's an endless car ride journey through flavor town and you're the driver so with all that being said if you enjoyed this video and learn something like subscribe and i'll let all of them i'll see you next time bye [Music] you

hey you caught me my creative process well i have you you need to have this book the reason why i've begun writing my second book yes already we stay going and you're gonna need this before that nine times new york times best selling most pre-ordered book in the history of my publisher's company thanks to you listen carefully please this book needs your reviews on amazon the link's in the description please it does a lot for the book it would mean a lot to me and it really helps the book you've done so much for it already so if you have a book please do leave a review back to the pizza rolls so today we are making the totino's pizza rolls god it feels disgusting to say that look i know this is a childhood favorite so i'm not just gonna bash it for the sake of batching it i've always had a passionate distaste for totino's pizza rolls even as a child you can ask my mom she tried buying me totino's pizza rules and i was like mom love you what the is this dog i cannot do this i thought about it for a little bit i'm like what exactly is the crust i'm gonna give our best shot at a true crispy exterior with that cheese pull inside which i know we'll get so with that being said let's make this shall we yeah walmart the land of good prices and disparity we're picking up toe teeny pee knees i'm sorry kendrick i farted i like how they just left these here good i really don't want to go in but we're going to anyway here we are in the aisle next to the burritos despicable wait wasn't it green oh here we go all right well i hate this i'm going home thank god that's it so we got the bag all right kids dinner is served i imagine as a parent this is probably a lifesaver i want to point out this cube of cheese that has emerged i like how it retained its shape how is that even possible this has been in a 425 degree oven for 15 minutes and the cube of cheese is still cute i'm afraid to eat these because i've heard the stories this has an internal temperature of 205 degrees grown appetit you know there are certain foods that are just four or five-year-olds it doesn't necessarily taste bad but like none of the flavors make any sense somehow this tastes nothing like pizza i don't know what the hell the cheese is this is a little crispy pillow of something but we're gonna make it a pillow of flavor turns out the elements to a pizza roll are simple dough sauce cheese and fine diced peppies you know i scratched my head for a while trying to figure out what the hell was wrapping your beloved totinos and it seems to be fried as you can see from the blistery crust what else blisters and fries kinda like this maybe sort of a wonton dough or at least something similar to make that you'll need 125 grams of all-purpose flour 20 grams of tapioca starch yes these are very specific measurements and three grams of fine sea salt which together took a mine and then add in 70 grams of very hot water mix until you get a shaggy dough and carefully knead until smooth about 5 minutes yes it will be hot so if you don't have asbestos hands thanks to the restaurant industry then i'd recommend using heat proof plastic gloves cover that with plastic wrap give it a whole some personality and let it rest for 30 minutes now while that's resting let's get all of our stuff for our filling for your tomato sauce get a medium saucepan and add six ounces or 170 grams of pancetta cut into quarter inch strips a light glove of extra virgin olive oil set that on the stove over medium heat and cook for five minutes stirring often or until it's released it's fat and it's brown and crisp then add four cloves of garlic thinly sliced two red fresno chilies finely diced and saute just until fragrant about 1 minute then add a 28 ounce or 795 gram can of crushed san marzano tomatoes a little splash of water that's been tossed around in here now empty can three sprigs of fresh thyme season lightly with salt and a small pinch of sugar that just helps kind of curb the acidity but it's not a requirement bring them to a simmer over medium heat reduce the heat to low and let that cook and reduce for eight minutes stirring occasionally once done season a taste of salt and pepper not only is that the hardest thing you're going to need to make for the filling but it's also a lovely tomato sauce worthy of coating a nice pasta or being spread on a beautiful pizza dough because you probably won't use all of it for the rest of the filling get yourself half a pound or 227 grams of a whole pepperoni well a mini pepperoni that is you can find this at a lot of stores dice it into quarter inch cubes and keep the cubes even as best you can and well that's kind of it for that part unless you make your own pepperoni which is coming trust me now the cheese mixture is just as important here it's all about ratios to make the flavor special so combine one cup or 60 grams of braided monterey jack cheese 1 cup or 60 grams of grated low moisture mozzarella and half a cup or 30 grams of grated parmigiano-reggiano please i am begging you grate your cheese fresh unless you really prefer sawdust or a bunch of starch to ruin the meltability and flavor texture okay your filling components are done now is the time to finish your dough so take it out of your plaster wrap cut it into four equal pieces roll each piece on a pasta roller until you get a sheet about an eighth of an inch thick cut into two and a half inch by two and a half inch squares and you're ready to fill them now making your own dough here comes with a much better texture but if you're strapped for time i get it you can use your pre-made square wine time wrappers now keep those covered and heavily dusted with cornstarch so they don't stick or dry out to assemble get a little square start with half a teaspoon of cheese in the center followed by a scant teaspoon of your sauce gonna be real nice skill a couple pieces of that bench a few tiny cubes of pepperoni and finally another half teaspoon of cheese it's better to slightly under fill these at first rather than overfill them and be very very very sad now lightly dampen the perimeter of your dough with water fold one edge over the filling then fold the opposite edge over that to form this sort of tube fold the bottom corner up and over making sure to seal the edges all around it and last fold the top down to seal your letter of flavor and when i say seal i mean every single crevice shut okay if you don't then when you fry these all of your filling will poof out one end now repeat that process until you use all your filling or you use all your dough and you have a true little pizza roll now it's very easy to cook these get a 5 quart pot filled with two and a half quarts of vegetable oil heated to 375 fahrenheit and fry these in two to three batches for around two to three minutes each or until you get a nice light golden brown puffed evenly and the inside is melty yummy carefully remove with a spider and drain on a wire rack and then repeat with all of your paint that blister golden puffed crust basking in its glory but what about the inside a gentle tear to reveal a cheese pull about three times the size of the actual pocket that contains it that is what i call a proper pizza roll something truly mightier than its size so let's taste test this and see if size matters and also uh if we beat the coveted totinos well here we are again i've picked a random one and look yet another cube of cheese emerging they talk about being crunchy you make this for your lover or your ancestors it's astronomically better in every single regard you can taste the layers of cheese you can feel the texture of that melty cheese oozing but more specifically it is full of classic flavors that are truly reminiscent of pizza is this a win not until we have our deciding factor mr totino simp himself pano there he is now tell me your love for totinos totino's is the best thing ever made totino if you're out there i love you open your mouth nice and wide he's processing why are your pants all wet number two number one was better you just knew i knew i'm sorry totino i don't mean it but papa killed it so that actually tastes like pizza it's like a mini calzone whereas this just kind of tastes like a totino's pizza roll and you also got the crunch even though they've been cooling down for a bit they're still that crunch you did so good thank you buddy yeah we knew we would win this and i know that it takes a lot longer do i expect anyone to make this no but if you want a superior eating experience this will actually bring that to you you've never eaten this before this will change the way you look at a pizza roll because this is what a pizza roll should have always been you want to know what else has a molten inside of 475 000 degrees b-roll [Music] orgasm that is it so we made our totinos pizza rolls should a pizza roll exist i don't think it really needs to but i also at the same time see the convenience aspect you want a snack put in the oven it's done right but there's so many other things that also do that i also understand that these are an unrealistic thing to make so again you're making these for an experience whatever it is that you're having a little snack event with so with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like

Get My Cookbook: http://bit.ly/JWCookbookAm...",2022-11-27 21:59:44.386764, today we're making the fastest butter chicken let's begin [Music] welcome back to buff faster this series where we find a way to make your favorite foods as fast as we possibly can today we're making butter chicken someone's gonna order it go and get it and i'm gonna make it before they get back start your entrance place your orders and let's make this shall we butter chicken okay recipe on the website we should probably be counting the time that it takes for them to order because technically that takes time too look i'm right washing my rice oh there's no rice in there you always make time for washing your rice water in i used the pressure cooker on the last episode which uh taught me a lesson this is the one way to make rice really fast okay manual put it for three minutes i've never had butter chicken not one time to be honest i just found out what it looks like i think i will like it okay we're gonna cut our chicken to bite size pieces what does that mean uh are you able to bite it oh it does not that's not a good reason so single stroke slices make this a lot faster but you gotta have a sharp knife so in here cashmere chili turmeric the recipes on the website that was cumin that's garam masala salt and finally we're gonna add some ginger taking too much time this we can take time for normally you'd let this marinate but do you think we have time for that we can kind of find out what happens when we skip some of these standardized processes because i normally marinate this so i'm curious how this will affect the recipe should i drive faster if it's buzz faster yeah on y'all we're gonna cut our onion onions are done oh look the sun's here okay garlic good old-fashioned slice that just done you need a pan but a deep one makes sense okay turn it up always use ghee whenever you're making butter chicken please i think i should give me a flash costume and go go pick up the food and flash costumes go up like this oh my god okay problem solved just waiting for this to melt oh wow this ski smells great we've said this several times on this channel having everything near you right i've got my tools behind me down here having that stuff near you having all your pots pans associated with your movements that is the key to your speed okay we're coming up to temp we can have a little jazz moment if the wise main character wins again i'm gonna switch the car mode to the sports mode we're on econ mode right now saving gas we're starting to smoke here i'm gonna add my cheeky oh i see the problem this induction is only heating the center of it and not the outside of it so that's good that'll be really helpful for this and by helpful i mean literally not at all helpful so that vikram you like that wafting into my holes i'm gonna overcrowd the pan right now because i'm in a hurry don't do this another waiting period light jazz moment you know i feel like we're losing right now could be the weather i'm not feeling like a winner right now we got some nice color going on here we need a little bit of wider area of effect here just to get her started i'm flipping the chicken yeah yeah yeah i'm a little concerned with the fact that only the center was hot it turns out just this circle heat stuff i should have known that it's the exit right here it's crunch time what can i use to press this ah voila i don't want to keep flipping it over and over and over because we're going to finish it in the simmer right so we're weighing it all down with this flat even here hopefully that works let's get the vibe check at this place there's like a whole construction thing going on it's a gas station where you can't pump gas oh okay that's enough steering for the day i gotta get a move on on this there's a lot of simmering involved with this recipe so ow transfer there's literally no color on that all right just don't don't look at it i feel like every time i watch cooking shows and they say to sear something this is usually what it looks like so if you have a little bit more time stir it properly please onion and garlic in and then we're gonna season that using it with salt so the salt's really important in terms of speeding this up because that is what's going to draw the water out of it got a little saute that smells great wow all right these bad boys need to soften lid this real quick and the park can suck bro this dude don't know if he's getting out he getting in so whenever you're waiting for stuff like this you can do other things like you can start cleaning or just getting things out of the way right like clear your workstation i gotta check the order that's rice back to the crib we go hey look at all that water now we're gonna add our spices got more garam masala more kashmiri chili more turmeric fenugreek powder a little bit of sugar woogie and last but not least a little bit of garlic that i forgot earlier whoops they just picked up the food what oh my god i'm uh okay how is it they said 20 minutes it's only been 10 minutes just crossed 20 minutes it did it's been 20 minutes well then we're just gonna blend this right now okay you're gonna need a blender i hope this gets cooked all the way through all right onions going in and with the tomato sauce that looks pretty good actually heat back on you know what i'm not even gonna reduce it i'm just gonna go ahead and add my cream i can do this uh chicken just gonna i'm just gonna throw it all in right that's our only option right now maybe i was getting a little too cocky a little bit of salt what josh poppy we'll stir that together nicely this is how i would never ever make butter chicken good lord it doesn't look terrible though so the butter chicken is simmering we're in a good spot right now because we just need to simmer this for five minutes lid is going on that's hot ten minutes he got ten minutes to wrap it up two oh ten oh oh we got this i didn't have to do all that i think this shows two things you can always take the sort of artisanal approach and take your time with it and like really crank it out and make it every element perfect but as you just saw i threw everything together really quickly and a huff and it's still kind of working and that goes to show that there are no rules clean up your space it's always this is go get this go get that it's never what do you want to make faster i really don't have any concept of time i think that it's been like five minutes and it's been like four hours god i'm gonna die so soon i'm just gonna wake up and be like wow it's been a couple of years like josh you're 75. oh this doesn't look bad for skipping pretty much every single step not bad taste the sauce and it's seasoned perfectly chicken's cooked this is done it's been 14 minutes and look it somehow thickened i don't know how that's possible i think that there's a cooking god out there and i think it's watching over me right now it's already done kendrick's probably telling some funny joke that kendrick got love kendrick heat off last bit we have some cold butter two tablespoons and stir that in there's a piece of cilantro on my spoon that went in there sorry about it let it emulsify in gonna get nice and rich and creamy beautiful we're done oh my god oh god damn and they're five minutes out and they can eat my butter chicken rice in make it look nice you know we have the time we've skipped every single rule i've ever had i might have learned myself something here cilantro never butter chicken 25 to 28 minutes to make this butter chicken on the fly as quickly as humanly possible it looks right i usually prefer the sauce to be a little bit more velvety smooth but you know i'm not opposed to this light the sun's going away because the sun's like all right show's over but not yet we still have to wait for them show time door's not gonna get now it's time for the blind voting round choo choo [Music] so we got the best four out of five except for one person ulysses even if it was 50 50 because the other one was still good we still made a delicious butter chicken but more importantly it reached the heights you would desire in a butter chicken simply faster you

gourmet for this price right here that's but cheaper [Music] chicken tender meals have seemed to become a staple I respect that honestly I do kind of boring you get your Fried Chicken Fries which oftentimes are soggy and almost always disappointing coleslaw that isn't just bad but it's like lukewarm you know what happens to lukewarm male runny you expect it to clean the Cabbage but instead when you put it in your mouth it just kind of drains in the back of your throat already this is a very cheap meal not only are we gonna slash the price but we're gonna make it the ideal meal that it should have been at the same time while keeping your wallet safe so with all that being said let's make this shall we look the best way to save money is to use what you already have so although I always recommend making your own spice mix unfortunately the number of spices I would use here would make this well two to three bucks over what I want this to cost for you so we went out and found a chicken seasoning that we thought tasted decent for about 2.78 cents and we're only going to use some of it just make sure it has salt and if it doesn't well salt it please Fried Chicken without generous salt is like Earth with no oxygen first let's talk chicken so four boneless and skinless chicken breasts lightly pound them to flatten them and widen them slightly cut them into six strips each that leaves you with 24 strips total which gives up to about eight servings depending on how much you eat and these are Hefty boys after frying separately mix together two cups or 475 milliliters of Buttermilk and add two tablespoons or 22 grams of whichever chicken spice you have on hand if it has salt perfect if it does not have salt then add about one tablespoon or 14 grams of kosher salt along with that mix together add your chicken strips and let them marinate for at least 20 minutes in the fridge but ideally overnight then go ahead and make your dredge by combining three cups or 450 grams of all-purpose flour three and a half tablespoons or 40 grams of your chicken spice again if it doesn't have salt then add about one and a half tablespoons or 23 grams of kosher salt in this whisk together and uh there you go start heating up seven quart pot filled with about three quarts of vegetable oil to 350 Fahrenheit now while that's going instead of doing a little twirl around the kitchen we're gonna make our slaw in a medium-sized Bowl slang in a quarter cup or 52 grams of [Music] two green onions thinly sliced zest of one lemon salt and pepp to taste the juice of that same lemon wow zero waste very nice and four cloves of garlic grated mix it together and your Landing zone is prepared for your so get half ahead of green cabbage and using a very sharp knife or a mandolin slice this bad boy real thin you know the closer to paper the better mandolin's gonna be a lot faster and easier for most of you but be careful because it's the number one finger death trap I can think of so many Souls climbed the horror anyway add your cabbage to the Bowl toast together and season with additional salt if needed and look at that often times with a great slot less is more and I can tell you now this slaw proves that logic sauce in a medium-sized Bowl add half a cup or 105 grams of mayo a third cup or 90 grams of ketchup fresh cracked black pepper and salt to taste three tablespoons or 43 grams of hot sauce this is Cholula two teaspoons or 10 grams of Worcestershire sauce getting good at that two cloves of garlic grated mix that together and you have a chicken sauce do not add me with your Cane's  I know how to make a proper chicken sauce worthy of any chicken strip also we have mccains but better so before we fry our let's prep our fries these are curly fries that are sort of like Arby's in the sense that they're lightly battered some say it's a No-No but I don't really care because it's delicious now you'll need 5 medium potatoes no need to peel them I do want to point out that you do not need to make these curly for this to work you can make it into matchsticks please relax but if you have a spiralizer that is how you'll make them curly by using the curly fry attachment that comes with it assuming you have one so pop that bad boy on later rip get all you got then curly boys then place all your processed potatoes in a bowl cover with warm water season the water generously with salt and let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes drain your potatoes dry them as much as possible with towels or paper towels toss the fries lightly with just a tiny pinch of all-purpose flour and then in a separate large bowl add in one cup of your dredge that you made earlier plus one tablespoon or seven grams of paprika fresh cracked black pepper whisked together then whisk in one and a half cups or 350 milliliters of water and now we're ready to get cooking first your chicken in batches pull your chicken from the marinade toss in your remaining two cups of dredge shake off the excess dip back into the marinade and dredge One Last Time really pack it on the flour so it adheres okay if you're double dredging and you have undressed parts of your chicken let me tell you I will ding dong your door and tell you that you're not getting a kiss she got the excess and repeat with all of your chicken pieces now once they're breaded in two to three batches fry your chicken for three to four minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 165 Fahrenheit and you have a beautifully flaky golden brown piece of chicken remove and place in a wire rack to cool then immediately season very lightly with salt while still hot and that's your chicken repeat with all your chicken and once that's done you're going to want to immediately jump onto your fries in three to four batches dunk your lightly starch coated fries into your batter once everything is nicely coated shake off the excess and lay into your oil gently be careful fry for three to four minutes or until beautifully crispy and light golden brown remove drain in a wire rack and again lightly season with salt wall hot and repeat with the rest of your fries now I know these cheat the fry system I'm not mad matter of fact I'm going to enjoy every culinary sinful crunch now to assemble get yourself a large plate or a quarter sheet tray lined with parchment get your salon a little Ramekin some of your chicken sauce and a separate one add on a generous layer of your crispy hot fries three pieces of your chicken nicely aligned and that is a beautiful chicken tender meal organized clean cut absolutely filled with the brim with flavor and above all for this price per person right here now let's taste test this and see if your tenders are a number one Contender wow here we are before we even start listening we've been seeing some people Josh there's no way that that costs that much it cost me 25 to go get all this stuff if you had to buy everything yes but the thing is you buy a five pound bag of flour did you use that entire thing of flour no you can still use it again you're only using a small portion you can make this recipe probably multiple times the point is to maximize flavor with technique using as little inexpensive ingredients as possible and that's what we do right first thing first slaw often have the Simplicity of this actually makes this better look at this can we get a sound test good God the flavor of this is immaculate and I honestly didn't expect it to turn out so good I oftentimes want to add a ton of ingredients to stuff and it's just not necessary oh I didn't try these whoever said you shouldn't batter your fries should shut up is he coated with the sauce you can have the instant gratification of going to your favorite chicken shop the freshness of getting this chicken and having the ultimate control for this Price Right Here per serving still it doesn't get any better than that it just doesn't and you could say you made it you have a bad day Go Achieve something you want to know what else tickles my tendies b-roll [Music] thank you okay so we made our chicken tending meal are you tired of having dry chicken I just want to know honestly at this point forget everything else I was gonna say I don't even care we already know it's good chicken breast is single-handedly one of the most difficult foods to cook stop uh and we had french fries oh we just let's just leave this thing because this is this is this is going to be what it is I am completely out of it I did not have my coffee I don't even know what year it is I

$3 Ramen : https://www.y...",2022-11-26 21:59:44.386764, we can all agree that ramen's one of the greatest foods on the planet so we're gonna take instant and pit that against the most expensive ever could be a waste of money [Music] okay so today we are making two different kinds of ramen we're gonna take an instant ramen doll it up a little bit you know put some stuff in there and then we're gonna make the most expensive ramen that we possibly can as previously stated now josh how do we make an expensive ramen well for one we're going to take a lot of time to make that broth as good as possible but then it comes down to the accoutrement it comes down to each and every little thing the aroma oil the tare the noodles and of course the protein but we're going to take a fine dining approach and i'm not just going to throw caviar on this we're gonna do a bunch of other things to jack up that price put it together and see if we make the ultimate ramen that hopefully is better than the four dollar one so with all that being said let's make this shall we this is what a four dollar ramen looks like and this is what a 800 ramen looks like or well we spend 800 on all the ingredients to just get to this one bowl so we're gonna count that okay real quick let's start with mr humble shin instant ramen is your go-to ideally shin black because it's just simply better first off boil some eggs by getting a medium sized pot filled with water bring it up to a gentle boil over medium-high heat that's gentle not a geyser gently lay in one egg per bowl of ramen that you'll be making fluctuate temp as needed so the eggs don't clang and bang around like all the stuff that you leave in your trunk boil exactly 6 minutes and 30 seconds then immediately place in an ice water bath let it cool till just warm and peel submerged in water and those are your softies when you're ready to use them you just slice them in half now optionally you can add some mushroom i just did about a half pound of button mushrooms quartered get a 10 inch skillet hot over medium high adding just enough oil to coat the bottom add in your shrooms sear for three to four minutes tossing occasionally season your taste with salt and that's it now cook your shin ramen as per package instructions pop it into a bowl and on some thinly sliced green onion your mushrooms either half or a whole soft boiled egg and some nori strips which kept wilting annoyingly so i went with the chiffonade which also wilted it's fine and that's your basic bowl it's simple but it does the trick now the next one is a completely different world in every aspect and full of luxury we're using a ton kotsu broth as our base but that usually takes 14 to 18 hours of boiling doesn't it well guess what pal thanks to my restaurant experiences i can tell you a little secret most restaurants don't have the time and they're not gonna make the time instead they use a pressure cooker believe it or not they pressure cook the broth for a little bit then pressure cook some fat in there blend it boil it again and that's how they do it welcome to the future well the future for you the restaurant industry's been done that all right so here's how you do it you'll need two pounds or 900 grams of pork neck bones and two and a half pounds or a little over a kilo of sliced pork  i'm really enunciating that because if you say it too fast it sounds a little funny make sure that the pork pox have the skin on which really helps emulsify the stock now purists out there will say oh we get to places in a bowl and cover with cold water and leave it in the fridge overnight but look it's completely optional either way place those in a pot cover with fresh cold water and bring to a boil boil for two minutes skimming any scum that rises to the top and then immediately drain rinse with cold water getting any impurities off then place your now clean sparkly bones in a pressure cooker add just enough water to cover plus another cup or so pop the lid on set the pressure to high for one and a half hours and while that's going let's make our chashu get a four pound or two kilo pork belly pull it up tight like a porchetta tie your rolled pork into three intervals to make it a beautifully spiraled roast heat up a 7 quart dutch oven over medium high add just enough vegetable to cook the bottom and once it's so hot i wanna cry so your pork on two sides gently to get some golden brown going on then leaving it fat side up add in one cup or 250 milliliters of sake the one i used here costs about 150 a bottle which uh hurts my heart but we're doing it for science followed by one cup or 250 milliliters of water three quarters of a cup 175 milliliters of shoyu this one being about 50 a bottle one cup for 250 milliliters of mirin a quarter cup or 50 grams of granulated sugar a two inch or five centimeter piece of peeled ginger sliced one bunch of green onion cut into thirds and one shallot quartered with the skin left on bring that up to a boil over medium high drop the temp to low and simmer covered with a lid for three hours turning occasionally until the deed is done and you get a tender little belly right there brother now you can either use that right away or if you're making it ahead refrigerate and slice while cold to get beautifully clean slices now unless you're unreasonably slow you should still have some time left with your pressure cooker to make your most important elements the tauri the aromatic oil which neither should be skipped here and of course the toppings we already showed you how to make your soft boiled eggs and the nori simply just needs to be cut super thin and chiffonade like so for the atari in a medium sauce pot add a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of sake yes that's the expensive one set over medium high and as soon as it boils optionally using a kitchen torch carefully ignite the steam and let it flambe till the flame dies out then add a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of shiradashi half a cup or 120 milliliters of mirin half a cup or 120 milliliters of good aged soy sauce this one being about 60 buckaroonies and one cup or seven grams of bonito flakes you can also use niboshi if you're a purist okay i get it bring that up to heat and as soon as it starts to get steamy hot turn the heat off and steep for five minutes then just strain that through a mesh sieve and that's your tare now there is a lobster element to this as well so you'll need two whole lobster i did the deed with them [Music] i did it respectfully and humanely as you should it's a very important note and i really hope that people stop ignoring it please dispatch your lobsters humanely research it learn it this isn't even a joke that being said do not throw away their heads and save them for later i cook their tails and claws for four minutes in gently boiling water now i really only want the tails for this but you can of course use the claws as well once it's cooked pop it into ice bath then split the tails in half lengthwise remove the vein extract the meat clean any yuckiness in there if needed and next let's tuck aromatic oil absolutely essential to this bowl you'll need one cup of lard heat until completely melted then add a mix of half a bunch of green onions cut into two inch segments and eight cloves of lightly crushed garlic left whole lower the heat to medium-low and let the cook swirling occasionally for five to seven minutes or until the vegetables are golden brown and toasted strain through a fine mesh sieve and stir in half a teaspoon of toasted sesame oil and if you really want to push the limit here you can totally smoke that away and no i don't mean with your usb port pen okay i'm talking about hickory smoke brother here i have a little miniature smoker set up place some compressed wood in a little sort of bowl made of foil put that in the bottom of your smoking bowl or a perforated pan setup blast your wood with a blowtorch till completely on fire then gently blow on it to put out the fire and get that smoke rolling place a perforated pan or wire rack over that place a container of oil on top of that cover with foil or lid and let that bad boy smoke for about five to eight minutes or until smoky to your liking now back to our broth after that one and a half hours release the pressure being careful of any spritzing it's kind of like a scalding hot sprinkler from hell now add half a pound or 225 grams of pork fat close the lid bring it back up to high pressure and cook for another one and a half hours now one more time release that pressure ah there's that hellfire sprinkler system once the pressure is released open it up carefully scoop out the fat back using a spider and place it in a blender cover with about a quart of broth blend on high until you get a completely smooth and creamy emulsified base strain your pork stock out of the pressure cooker and into a pot then add your blended snow white milkies sorry pop that bad boy on the stove over medium high optionally and to be frank this is a cardinal sin in my opinion but we have to test it so we're gonna add some of our lobster tail shells in the head of two lobsters from earlier be sure to clean the head before adding by the way followed by a mix of one bunch of green onion cut into 2 inch segments and 5 cloves of garlic lightly crushed in a 1 inch knob of ginger sliced bring that up to a boil over medium high and boil for 25 to 30 minutes or till reduced and slightly thickened now if the appropriate amount of gelatin was extracted then you should have a beautiful kitchen we're pretty much ready but we need to add a little extra bit of spice to this bowl i got us some slightly more expensive mushrooms that are not truffles okay not trying to make a cop out here we've got one pound of lines made mushrooms and half a pound of honchime mushrooms cut those guys up into bite-sized pieces toss together then sear them in a pan similarly to the previous method except this time once they're cooked add in two tablespoons of 28 grams of unsalted butter and let they cook until the butter browns tossing occasionally and then they are done be sure to season these nicely with salt by the way nobody likes an unseasoned mushroom well well well it's assembly time torch or sliced chashu as many slices as you want per bowl till hot and lightly browned on both sides then purple add about two to three and a half tablespoons of tare hit it with additional salted taste ladle in about two and a half cups of your tonkotsu broth add in six ounces of cooked straight ramen noodles which have been cooked and drained according to package directions a light drizzle of your aromatic oil one to two teaspoons will do look it's an aroma okay a gentle kick in the pants followed by your egg mushroom green onion half of a lobster tail nori that's been chiffonade a generous dollop of caviar whichever one you like assuming you have a favorite you'll need at least 30 to 50 grams this stuff and that is your bowl this recipe does make enough for four but we're only making one here so bummer now let's taste test and see if spending more than 200 times the price was worth it so it comes down to this this ended up being is it fair to put an instant ramen against this i'll judge graciously in that way broth a little bit spicy i'm not opposed to instant ramen it's good don't act higher than thou and say that instant ramen isn't good if you get the right kind shin black delicious everything else combined this tastes exactly like i thought it would now 800 for this i know there's some sacrilege involved with this broth check god damn it's not even fair this could be one of the best ramens we've made on the channel oh the broth it's not fair to compare the broth because the broth isn't the most expensive part by the way the lobster didn't add anything to it don't taste it sorry let's talk about the expensive stuff first off caviar it's nice little salty briny bits i like it okay i have my answer believe it or not making a ramen more expensive does not make it better at all this ramen is better than the instant one undoubtedly each element the lobster etc you can add all that stuff but you honestly don't have to this grommet is perfectly good on its own this is why you don't mess with a perfectly good food but i definitely don't want this now that this is here you don't need expensive ingredients to make something taste delicious and this ramen right here was a waste of money thanks you wanna know what else makes me pop my wallet open b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we have our expensive ramen very expensive and of course our instant ramen that's been dolled up just a hair i'm reassessing my statement a little bit i'm not saying the caviar in there etc doesn't make it better tastes a little bit more luxurious a little bit more fancy but for that price point i have to be a little more scrutinizing and say look is the boost worth it no this is a dish where the foundation is completely predicated off of proper technique and knowing what the flavor should be and just putting in the time the effort and assembling it properly that is what makes it good it's also a smattering of so many different high flavor ingredients got all that umami and it'll have you saying mommy i'll tell you what but with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music]

Suadero could be the best homemade beef taco that you have never had.

Black Garlic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7An6nWb...",2022-11-26 21:59:44.386764, if you know what this is you're going to want to watch and if you've never heard of it you're going to want to watch [Music] okay so today we're making swazero tacos if you don't know what this is let me just preface wadero isn't just some kind of a taco swadero is a specific cut of meat it is the intermediate part of the cow between the belly and the neck it must be getting thrown away because i've never seen it at like a basic grocery store and it's upsetting because i think it makes one of the greatest tacos of all time put your goddamn chicken fajitas down get some swaddero and let's make this shall we swatteiro is a cut of meat to accompany that we have a very special dark salsa which is the key to this special taco all topped off with some other delectable goods let's begin with the star of the show you're gonna need two pounds or 900 grams of swadero meat no not brisket not chuck roast swadero you can find this at some mexican butchers but if you absolutely just cannot find it and please try then you can use brisket which i suppose is somewhat of a comparison but not really and defeats the entire purpose so remember that we're gonna confit this bad boy but first you're gonna cure it by combining one teaspoon or four grams of smoked paprika half a teaspoon or two grams of ground cumin half a teaspoon or half a gram of ground cinnamon one tablespoon or ten grams of kosher salt one teaspoon or four grams of granulated sugar whisk together [Music] optionally you can lightly score the fat on the swadero season that fool with all your cure really rub your meat and let it sit in the fridge covered overnight this is pretty essential for the flavor so please try not to skip next get yourself a deep baking dish or heavy bottom pot in this case i have a deep half hotel pan to that you'll add one head of garlic broken into individual cloves with the skins left on two serranos cut in half lengthwise three to five bay leaves arrange those around to create essentially a trivet to keep your meat off the bottom dab your swadero dry with the paper towel and place on top then pour a mixture consisting of one and a half quarts or 1.2 kilos of melted lard and one and a half quarts or 1.2 kilos of melted beef fat also known as tallow your meat should be completely submerged and look i get it sometimes your meat floats a little so if it does i like to weigh it down with whatever i can that's heat safe like these chef press cover that with foil tightly and pop into an oven set to 225 to 250 fahrenheit for about three hours or until the meat is extremely tender now listen up pal if you want a traditional confit then you'll let the fat solidify and store it in the fridge for two to four days to age before using but for the record you don't have to do this either way gently reheat that in an oven until hot and melted pull the meat out and shred it as finely as you can then chop it even finer with a cleaver or knife add that all to a bowl add a touch of your confit fat cover and keep warm now for the extra special salsa this is sort of a traditional salsa that i've combined with the technique of a thai non-prick pal yeah i know we're getting a little fancy in a medium-sized pan add two shallots very thinly sliced and to that add one cup or 240 milliliters of vegetable oil heat that over medium once you start to sizzle begin constantly stirring until you turn it golden brown and the bubbling begins to subside then immediately remove and drain on a paper towel allow the oil to cool slightly then add one ounce or 28 grams of seeded guajillo chilies 2 cups or 14 grams of seeded chili to arbol and 2 seeded ancho chilies and let those cook over medium heat stirring often until those start to brown then add 12 cloves of black garlic this is my homemade black garlic link in the description for that 2 teaspoons or 12 grams of fine sea salt 2 tablespoons or 20 grams of light brown sugar half a teaspoon or half a gram of ground cinnamon one and a half teaspoons or six grams of ground cumin toss to combine then add one and a half tablespoons or 21 grams of white distilled vinegar then just let that simmer over medium heat for one more minute add all of your solos to the blender minus the oil and blend until as fine as possible then add 8 peeled garlic cloves blend again until smooth as possible then add all of your oil and blend on max speed and you guessed it until as smooth as possible now pour out this stunning combination of deep crimson red transitioning into a space-like dark void of rich chili flavor and you have your blackened salsa we're nearly ready but we first need to make a quick guac traditionally in a mocajete if you care 2-3 ripe avocados should do lightly mash those guys then add 2 teaspoons or 12 grams of fine sea salt 1 and a half tablespoons or 23 grams of lime juice half a finely diced sweet onion 1 serrano brunoise which is just a very fine dice a quarter cup of 4 grams of finely chopped cilantro mash and fold together until combined and then adjust to taste with salt and lime juice as needed remember we want this punchy salty and acidic now optionally take your shredded swadero toss with your salsa to taste and we're ready to assemble heat a caster and skillet over medium high add in a tortilla and heat for 15 to 30 seconds per side now if it's hot enough it will get some light char on both sides and should be beautifully pliable repeat with all of your tortillas and place in a tortilla armor ideally from ulysses grandmother now to fill these bad boys get generous with your sauce suadero arrange it nicely followed by a fat dollop of your guacamole a little extra fine diced sweet onion some crushed chicharron if you're feeling it and a little bit of fresh cilantro now slap your cheese grater throw it out the window on your brand new car and open your mouth wide for a taco that is sure to have that special someone calling you back even though they looked completely disinterested in you taco that nobody's ever heard of or rather not enough people have heard of swadero it's got the fixins the onion the cilantro we added a nice acidic guac on top that's totally optional i know that vikram kano and kendrick would really appreciate if it was not on it they detested my feelings got hurt and i'm not gonna be taste testing these today you can blame them get back in there all right i'll taste it more importantly it has this beautiful salsa now many of you may not have seen this before it's very dark very rich and it has sort of these caramelized flavors very nice we made a salsa verde in the chipotle breeder bowl which actually goes quite nice on this little dollop so we're doubling up on salsa you hit it with the lime juice a little tinkle on there wow unbelievable avocado aside the texture of the swadero meat the thing that's special about swizzero is it's both tender and fatty and yet it has that sort of nice dense chew that a good steak does sometimes you want that sort of meaty density to it it's packed with flavor it's got all the sauces if you want to up your taco game and you want to really seem like you know what the you're doing then you need to bring suadero onto your menu permanently and that's from me to you you want to know what else is full of piping hot meat submerged in its own juices and fat b-roll all right guys and that is it so we made our swazero tacos they came out absolutely perfect doing this as a confit i think was the perfect choice we're trying to balance that sort of tender juiciness and this cut of meat isn't super super super fatty it's it's kind of like in the middle lowish end depending on what cut you get and it worked beautifully tacos are good no matter how you have them this is a nice refresh from the ones that you've already had add this to your list so with all that being said if

Homemade jalapeño cheese sausage patties, oozing soft cooked eggs, homemade buns, and a lot of bacon makes this a true breakfast baconator.

Whopper...",2022-11-26 21:59:44.386764, of course they didn't stop at the baconator they had to do breakfast and so now we have to do it to them [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the wendy's baconator they just said well what if we just make a breakfast sandwich and put a whole lot of bacon on it guys it's a breakfast sandwich with sausage bacon cheese egg i can't complain about that it does sound good it's just a damn square patty i'm sick of it why it bothers me so much every time i look at a square patty and i get it it's like maybe a branding thing it's like when you see the square patty you think wendy's at the same time when i see the square patty i think well i'm pissed off now do i think this breakfast sandwich is good no but i do like the direction that they were going with it so i think that if we take each element elevate it to its highest degree put it all together in between two glorious buns then it's gonna be a whole lot better so with all that being said let's make this shall we so we're approaching the wendy's we went to last time that's the cursed one like the really scary one there is something emanating from that place something's wrong here don't you feel like this weighted heavy darkness so uh we forgot wendy's does not serve breakfast at this hour it's 1 p.m so we're gonna try and order one hi uh i know you guys stopped serving the uh the breakfast baconator is there any way that we can get one made at all there's no way i can i can do it can i pay extra for it no no worries thank you message received all right we'll be back it's the next day we sent someone out and uh i didn't want to go back to the spooky wendy's it's very scary skilly so we've got the bag fry should be both hot and crispy if yours aren't let us know yeah breakfast time hi this what y'all excited about here's what it's supposed to look like so far away someone assembled this the egg is completely overcooked but that's a different conversation this is actually one of the better sandwiches i think i've had in a fast food restaurant in a long time it looks terrible the egg is long gone this egg died 30 years ago the sausage patty is seasoned exactly how i like it it's really really really really nice bacon's bacon bacon's good the buns not good that being said this is one of the better sandwiches in totality breakfast or not that we've had on this channel so this might be a little bit of a challenge let's find out if you've never had this let me break it down our sandwich contains a homemade jalapeno cheese breakfast sausage patty an excessive amount of bacon a swiss cheese sauce of course our famous buns and some oozing eggs over easy we've seen our buns many times so i'm gonna be quick here see the full recipe for these on my burger king whopper video link in the description for that mix 170 milliliters of water with 125 milliliters of milk get that warm whisk in 12 grams of bread machine yeast then whisk in one whole egg and one egg yolk in a medium sized bowl mix together 525 grams of bread flour 60 grams of granulated sugar 4 grams of amylase and 8 grams of fine sea salt once that's combined add your liquid to a stand mixer begin mixing add your flour gradually till all of it's added then mix mix mix till smooth then add in 14 grams of softened unsalted butter and 30 grams of softened bacon fat all i did was replace two thirds of the butter with bacon fat which is totally optional mix till smooth and combined shape into a big old bowl pop into a bowl cover the plastic wrap rise one hour punch it down cut into eight even pieces and roll those pieces into toit balls place in the center of a greased four-inch metal english muffin ring she's that's a mouthful press their tops with the bottom of a greased cup cover lightly with crease plastic wrap proof 30 minutes and bake at 375 fahrenheit for 15 minutes or until a beautiful glistening golden brown emerges finish with a brush of melted butter remove your muffins and let them cool now let's talk jalapeno cheese breakfast sausage we'll need 2 pounds or 900 grams of ground pork but i want it to be fatty okay none of that 90 lean bull so my recommendation would be to grind your own with a nice fatty boston butt roast but hey not everyone wants to be a real one and grind their own pork i get it so anyway to your pork you'll add two jalapenos that have been placed over an open flame until completely charred all over then wiped of all of its char de-seeded and finally diced follow that with 2 teaspoons or 14 grams of garlic powder 2 teaspoons or 4 grams of ground fennel seed half a teaspoon or half a gram of onion powder 1 teaspoon or 3 grams of jalapeno powder which is optional but you could totally make yourself in my make your own spices guide link in the description you like that plug yeah two and a half teaspoons or 10 grams of kosher salt 1 teaspoon or 5 grams of msg oh did you not know that wendy be doing that 1 tablespoon or 16 grams of granulated sugar give that a mix till thoroughly combined then add in 1.5 cups or 85 grams of grated cold cheddar cheese mixed till combined and finally fold in one tablespoon or two grams of finely chopped sage moving on to swiss cheese sauce very easy heat one and a half tablespoons of 21 grams of unsalted butter in a medium saucepot over medium heat once yummy add in one and a half tablespoons or 13 grams of all-purpose flour whisk together and cook for 30 seconds then whisk in two tablespoons or 30 grams of heavy cream and one and a quarter cup or 300 milliliters of whole milk once that starts to thicken add in half a cup or 33 grams of grated raclette and half a cup or 33 grams of braided gruyere keep mixing that bad boy until beautifully smooth glossy and sexual if it's a bit too thick simply add a splash or two of milk until it has a consistency that runs just a little bit add a small pinch of grated nutmeg season a taste of salt and your cheese sauce is done you're kind of looking for roughly the consistency of slightly runny mayo that sounds gross but you know where i'm going here so i managed to get our bacon cartoonishly wavy and perfectly cooked with this method get yourself a good old-fashioned bike and sheet line it with foil add one pound of thick cut sliced bacon in one even layer filling out your sheet as much as possible but not overlapping one layer all right not one and a half layers pop that into an oven set to 400 fahrenheit and honestly look it's fine if the oven's cold when you add it or if the oven's already on from baking your buns just the times will change so if it's off it'll take around 20 to 25 minutes but if it's already on it'll take about 10 to 12 minutes once your bacon is cooked and crispy or floppy to your liking pull it out and drain on a paper towel this method will not only get you the most evenly cooked bacon but it will also get you the most tender luxurious tasting bacon you'll ever have respect and shout out to the homies that like their bacon flaccid okay i get that sometimes it makes sense it's time to finish this thing off first your sausage patty form then into a four to five ounce ball then shape it into a half inch thick square patty that's slightly wider than your buns because it will shrink a bit preheat a flat top or nonstick skillet over medium high lightly grease it with oil then add your patty and sear for 2-3 minutes flip and sear for another two to three minutes now once it has some nice browning and is cooked all the way through about six to eight minutes total you have a beautiful patty packed full of oozing cheese juicy salty breakfast sausage goodness will this sausage patty bust it down sensual style is it goated with the sauce sorry i've been on tik tok too much this weekend for the egg lightly butter or grease a nonstick skillet and set over medium heat then once that's hot add your ring mold to the center crack two whole eggs into your ring mold try to keep the yolk centered as best you can season the top with salt and pep then add a splash of water and cover with a lid for about one to two minutes i didn't have a lid so i used a bowl and once your egg white is fully cooked but the yolk is still runny it's done pop that out of your ring mold and thor she blows a slightly jarring to look at puck of egg that may or may not be the key to our sandwich now to assemble toast your buns always shouldn't have to ask add a nice generous spoonful of your swiss cheese sauce to your bottom bun spread it out a bit add your sausage patty a nice slice of american cheese melt that optionally with a torch one to two slices of bacon cut in half so it fills the sandwich nicely gently your soft egg hockey puck a slice of aged cheddar cheese see a nice mix of highs and lows on the sandwich melt that optionally with a torch and finally another barrage of bacon hilariously wavy generously sauce your top bun slap your knee call your grandma crown your king and tell her you ain't coming home today because this goddang sandwich is gonna need your full attention when you sit down and take your first bite now let's see how we fared against the demonic wendy so i did state that i thought this was one of the better sandwiches i've had which is ironic because their burger was horrible mamma mia papa spicy meatball i mean come on the layers i don't even know if i can fit this whole thing in my mouth but i sure can try i was like in a field of flowers but the flowers weren't flowers it was bacon this is single-handedly the greatest breakfast sandwich that i have ever made in my entire life and honestly it is thanks to wendy's because the amount of bacon the type of sausage plus that swiss cheese sauce is what makes this special pano come here you bad boy are you ready emotionally there's so much going on that is spectacular number two um all right it's not bad but yours just is on another absolute level is kind of unfair out of 10 this gets a 6.325 eight four four four four four four four one and a half out of ten that's high praise if you wanna sit down and enjoy a breakfast with your family your children your best friends people who bring you joy then this is gonna be the sandwich that you make [Laughter] you want to know what else has big wavy strips of meat in your face b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our wendy's breakfast baconator probably one of the most beautiful breakfast sandwiches we've ever made on this channel let's take a look at just a few of the other ones bing bang boom look at those which one do you want i did the square patty thing and it changed literally nothing the sausage patty we made was perfect but the square still pisses me off just make it

Additional...",2022-11-26 21:59:44.386764, we've made our favorite foods better cheaper and now it's time to make them faster [Music] when you order food the order is never perfect they get the order wrong it's delayed the food is soggy people think it's impossible for home cooking to be just as fast and equally if not better but we're here to prove that wrong the rules to this series are simple i need to make a gourmet meal in the same amount of time if not faster than the time that it takes to order it go out pick it up and bring it back this isn't just a race against the clock we're sending someone out you'll be able to see both of our povs and hopefully home cook or not you'll learn a damn thing or at least have fun i'm sorry but the person you cook orange chicken thank you recipe on the website first thing oil in oil's heating while that's going we have to cook our rice but the problem with doing in a rice cooker is going to take like 40 minutes i love my zojirushi which is not gonna work normally i would not do this but under this constraint we can learn how to save time rice in water even though i'm in a huge rush i'm still washing my rice pressure cooker we'll literally cut the cook time in half water manual and we'll set that to three minutes that's going this is heating i haven't used a pressure cooker in a long time so i don't really know if i'm doing this right or not it's just a regular day at the jw entertainment picking up orange chicken for this feast we're about to have i hope you guys like chicken well that's heating or chicken knife cut this into bite-sized pizzas you should be able to put the whole thing in your mouth and i know a lot of you can do that boom boom in how far away is this restaurant 10 minutes a little bit white pepper salt generously normally i would cure these but we don't really have time for that if we toss that just let it sit oh my god the oil is completely cold get our dredging station ready all-purpose flour cornstarch boom dredge part of what makes someone fast in the kitchen isn't just that they move quickly it's the choices that they make when they move make sense we're ready for the sauce you know another thing i'm hoping for is no one makes the chicken too hard bro i got these braces sauce is quite simple and i don't fully remember the recipe i'm gonna have to figure it out you have all of your equipment near you and in the places that you need it so that you're not fighting against yourself while you're cooking do i look stressed out maybe i am let's add oil teaspoon of sesame oil and a teaspoon vegetable oil heating over medium cut our garlic give it a nice rough chop terrible terrible idea to chop this garlic's chopped now half of that is going in but we're going to reserve the other half on the side now we're about to pull up get this orange chicken i've got some ginger here peeling with a peeler is great but i actually much prefer a spoon i'm gonna learn my lesson and actually grate it this time and let this garlic toast i've got a chili here this will be added at the end with the garlic open this filler up nice and neat all right this is where technique comes in to save you oh it's done we let this release naturally which i just learned about via google two minutes ago just let it sit jesus this knife is so dull this is a rarity for me why now right now i think there's a lot of yelling going on in the kitchen i feel like things are being thrown finely diced all right our veg is nice and toasted and you just kind of go around get our orange slices juice that directly to our pan are they really already there great day to eat some chicken smells good so warm yeah it was faster than expected i should have known this would happen crank this temp up we got vinegar soy sauce this recipe will be on the website okay sugar water our orange zest and a little splash of shaoxing that's going to come up to the boil the sauce is going this is heated chicken's ready to coat oh we're at temp too we fry now we can wait actually i think we can afford to wait the whole point is that we're doing multiple things at once if you don't do that this will take you significantly longer and that is where most home cooks go wrong you want to go wrong is that what you want we do need to thicken this so we have a cornstarch slurry equal parts this is boiling just wanna make sure that all that sugar gets dissolved it should be nearly there i feel good i'm not running out of real estate i'm gonna bread and fry this chicken i usually do this in batches but you know what do we have time for that hell no toss it i forgot that you can bread chicken this quickly i'm learning something here right now chicken is coated that's going in we're frying i feel like i'm forgetting something it's not does this get tossed in an egg or anything i feel good so i'm out corn starch slurry stir that in nicely hopefully that was enough slurry could be breaded more could be breaded a lot more but the thickness of this sauce looks great green onion okay that should be enough you know i thought we might have time for vegetables i was very wrong about that even when i'm in a rush i'm still gonna clean up a little bit that's another thing that kind of ruins the whole cooking speed right this is done i think that's not thick enough we do not have time to uh wait for it to reduce we're gonna stir that bad boy in there until it's as thick as we want it to be there we go my rice already ready maybe this pressure cooker thing really is good after all let's see if it explodes once again i hope there's nothing on fire i hope vikram didn't get hit with a pan that looks awful actually it might be all right that's actually not bad i'm blown away so now you know you can make rice in 15 minutes instead of 40 minutes and it's not bad is it perfect no but if you're in a hurry there's your option now this is done i finished this yay uh vikram which one do you like this one okay i hate this new series is this even good how did that work it's got a really good shoe to it too i've lost my goddamn scoop oh it's in there i guess the question is is it cooked oh thank god it's cooked okay they should be getting here any minute well i should be bleeding any minutes how about that i'm pretty sure he's done yeah do a little bit for the b-roll i'm confident that he's done toss it in the sauce generously bowl there right on top okay yeah where where just got back just parked first one was a tough one but nonetheless we did make orange chicken in the correct amount of time a bit of a challenge a bit rushed oh see they're here but this has been sitting here for like two minutes they locked the door and mine's fresh i know there's this condensating just becoming mushy and ushy you want that so despite it being rushed it can still be made in under an hour what was the time on this 28 minutes if you want to move a little slower you can make this in an hour and have something egregiously better i assume but we'll taste test and finalize that now yeah yeah so while we were cut we found out something that only proves my point more they gave us the wrong order this is ramen if you had just made it yourself you wouldn't even have to deal with that possibility would you i would love to say that this is a joke but this is actually what happened we need people to vote on this so we have someone going out to get more orange chicken but in the meantime hurry up hurry hurry honestly i thought the speed was really gonna affect this this is from our panda express recipe and it's just as good as i remember some of the pieces of chicken didn't quite get fully breaded but the majority of them are really nice the rice is great i will say the rice isn't as good as if it was in the zojirushi in terms of how close it got 80 let's bring on the voting round we got our other orange chicken i like how they have a piece of that's not orange that's yellow we're gonna do a blindfold taste test train depending on which dish they like they'll vote one or two uh fight the damn thing come on come on coming in here this is right here i'm not gonna let you go anywhere bad kendrick um yummy obviously this is not but better but it is better and we made it just as fast but better faster oh my god millennial if this ain't a euphoria moment i don't know what it is you may not be able to be as fast as me that's totally fine that's okay you can still make it quickly with the proper technique you can make great food within a reasonable amount of time quickly dare i say but fasterly you know what the hell i mean okay don't don't make me say that again leave us a comment let us know what you think of this new series do you like it do you not like it a lot of people have been asking for this so we're doing it this one dude literally commented on like every single video for like six months if you enjoyed this video and you learned

Tender beef barbacoa, the best rice, and all the ingredients to make the perfect homemade bowl. 

Rice Cooker: https://amzn.to/3h9f6RC...",2022-11-26 21:59:44.386764, Chipotle breedable is just a burrito without the tortilla but we can make it a whole lot more [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hold on wait very important announcement we're launching a new series test running it something you've asked for for a while this Wednesday in he said for three days we're making the burrito bowl from Chipotle wow back to Chipotle one of the few places that I'll go and eat and not actually hate it I know some people find this surprising which I don't understand why but there are some inconsistencies that are pretty frequent feel like I'm gonna be nice to them this time but after we make this burrito bowl you might feel otherwise otherwise so with that being said let's make this shall we oh my gosh shy puddle let's go and get it so it's Chipotle um appearance honestly eight out of ten I know that they have to keep them cheap and they look honestly quite nice menu I'm gonna give it a 5 out of 10.32634444 you have two options burrito or burrito bowl what else is there that's it service was great they did what they were supposed to do give them to three just a three no not out of ten three the bag we've all seen one of these before um Chipotle is one of my most favorite fast food places ever period and I mean that honestly why couldn't they have represented themselves better I can't keep protecting you I can't not like this now I have to eat it because there's multiple layers I'm gonna break this down by element first barbacoa one doesn't taste bad tastes good two dry three that is not Barbacoa that thing should be juicing all up in your mouth rice it's rice beans I think they gave me old beans these taste like bats does it just me or these beans straight up off they taste weird why is it sour long story short we did the burrito and so now we do their second best and really their only other option which is a proper burrito bowl as I've stated this is simply not a burrito it's a bowl so let's look at our elements we have our rice of course our protein which will be the juiciest most luxurious beef Barbacoa beautiful pinto beans not from a vibrant salsa verde and various accoutrement yeah you like that little Frenchy boy stuff let's begin with our beef you'll need two pounds or 900 grams of fatty brisket this is Australian wagyu brisket and two pounds of 900 grams of beef cheeks not the same as my cheeks in a large bracer or pot heat up enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the Pan Once hotter than the inside of a tent in the Mojave Desert cereal beef on all sides about three minutes per side till beautifully browned removing your beef as you sear to avoid overcrowding then once all that's seared place all your beef back yes now you can overcrowd add an eight cloves of peeled garlic three bay leaves one cinnamon stick four guajillo chilies whole two teaspoons or four grams of ground cumin and last but not least 2 cups or 475 milliliters of beef stock and the juice of two limes feel free to add the lime bodies to the brace as well lime bodied bring that up to a light simmer cover with the right fitting lid and place in an oven set to 350 Fahrenheit for three hours traditionally this would be like the whole goat that you wrap In Agave leaves and Berry underground with burning embers but you know beef cheek braise Works similarly check it occasionally adding broth if it begins to evaporate too much then remove your now delicately tender beef and shred it by hand you can use forks to do so but you don't really even need them because it melts in your mouth and your hand now once your beef is shredded nicely and I cannot stress this enough with its own fat okay no don't don't toss the fat I want it juice season it takes with salt and that is your beef of course while the Barbacoa is going you should start your beans since we're not using it from the can today say it twice because it's nice I've taste tested both canned pinto and fresh cooked and the difference is a textual Wonderland that you can control start with one pound or 450 grams of uncooked pinto beans cover those with at least four cups or one liter of water bring to a boil adding water as it evaporates out and boil for at least one hour or just until the beans are tender optionally you can drain and rinse them as well now we'll make essentially a charro bean or well beans not like we're using one single Bean here to medium sauce pot add six ounces or 170 grams of bacon cut into thick pieces I actually sliced my own bacon so I could get big one-inch Cubes but do what you can here now cook that over medium heat stirring often until you get beautifully crisp and browned about three to five minutes then add in uh sorry I'm getting kind of distracted Lord have mercy half pound 227 grams of chorizo continue to cook until the sausage is fully cooked stirring occasionally for about two minutes then crank the heat to medium high add in one cup or 137 grams of cherry tomatoes seasoning to taste with salt so those in and let those sear for one to two minutes until they pop and start to juice follow that with one yellow onion finely diced two Serrano chilies thinly sliced with their seeds and everything four cloves of thinly sliced garlic season again with salt to draw some of that water out stir together and sweat for three minutes not you sweating but once the vegetables are softened add in two teaspoons or six grams of smoked paprika one teaspoon or one gram of dried Mexican oregano a quarter teaspoon or half a gram of ground cinnamon and one teaspoon or 3 grams of Chipotle powder stir together and cook for one minute to lightly toast the spice finally add in 2 cups or 475 milliliters of chicken stock stir together then add all of your cooked beans along with a couple tablespoons of its cooking Water season that bad boy generously with salt and those are some real beans they'll call the Cowboys home slapping their knees like I'll get out for the rice I mean come on you wash your rice please don't make me explain it I've said it too many times alright this is two cups or 380 grams of medium grain rice once your rice is washed add it to the Lord of rice cookers Zojirushi if you have one along with equal parts of water which is 2 cups or 470 milliliters in this case this ratio will not work for any other cooking method outside of a rice cooker so press the magic button and enjoy an absolute tune now once it's cooked bust it open plop all of your hot fresh glistening rice into a large bowl and add the zest of one lime toss lightly together then add a third cup or 75 grams of unsalted butter gently stir that together avoiding breaking up the rice grains till everything is coated evenly with butter finally season a taste with salt pop in a half cup or five grams of finely chopped cilantro and the juice of one to two limes depending on their size then gently stir together till evenly Incorporated and that is a proper cilantro lime rice buttery rich and yet balanced in all of its Glory adjust salt levels as necessary salsa time yeah let's go yeah right you'll need to chart the following items over a stovetop one pound or 450 grams of tomatillos husked one sweet onion sliced in half and peeled and two jalapenos so Place those guys over a wire rack set directly on top of a stovetop flame on high heat and just let it rip now make sure those tomatillos are nicely charred in some spots but try to avoid making pure carbon that's charred tomatillos not moon rocks now for the jalapenos you want those fully blackened on every square inch then lightly chart your sweet onion Place those all into a bowl cover with plastic wrap and allow to steam for five minutes then to a blender add half a bunch of fresh cilantro with the stems and please wash your cilantro by the way they can be some real dirty boys a third cup or 80 milliliters of lime juice seven cloves of garlic then using a paper towel wipe off all of the Char on your jalapenos cut off their stems and pop them into your blender seeds and all if you're not a little baby which by the way totally okay to be a little baby papa still loves you you're sweet when you'll and finally your roasty tomatillos with their charred skins and everything this is why I said don't overchar them season those Brothers to taste with salt give it a good old-fashioned blend until smooth and that is your salsa verde all those little charred bits left in there that have been eviscerated will leave you with a lightly Smoky and very deep flavor that interacts beautifully with the fresh green flavors in this salsa Baka Bing Baka boom and Baka Mommy so we have all of our major elements let's talk accoutrement you'll need two avocados seeded quartered peeled and sliced thick or as thinly as you desire a 50 50 mix of grated monterey jack and low moisture mozzarella 1 cup or 113 grams of each tossed together lastly just some plain sour cream sure you can flavor your sour cream but we have plenty of flavor here so let's keep this simple now to Plate this up first thing down of course is your rice then add your beans using a slotted spoon a generous handful of your grated cheese your first sliced avocado which has gotten some flaky salt placed atop your juicy loosey-goosey Barbacoa beef a fat dollop of your sour cream which if you want to get a little fancy you can use the back of your spoon to make a nice gentle indentation on the top of that and add a few glugs of hot sauce inset indentation sort of like its own little bowl see it looks nice a couple generous spoonfuls of your salsa verde then just finish it off with a few pieces of cilantro to make a nice little green garden bushel in your bowl it almost looks like some sort of Chipotle version of a bibimbap Bowl which I'm not mad about so let's put these things side by side in oh god wow yeah that's uh that's a bummer and yes there isn't guac on the other Bowl because they forgot to add it not my problem nonetheless let us taste test and decide our winner today this is very important but that's a lighter flame than I had anticipated I was gonna light it on fire for metaphorical reasons if you got a book please leave a review on Amazon or wherever you got it it very much helps the book a massive thank you for the support this book this book has become the number one most pre-ordered book in the history of my Publisher's company Because of You unprecedented we're breaking records with this cookbooks don't usually sell like that all because of everybody's support so thank you so much please don't forget to leave a review I love you all I wanted to be silly about this unfortunately it was just kind of weird but wow this is hard for me I eat Chipotle more than I would like to admit I don't want to do this to them I just have to I also ordered this with guac and they did not put guac on it the rice alone wins this as a whole now Martin there's where is the meat this is hard for me to vote on because I still like theirs but you can tell the difference between something that is quality had time spent on it had to be hours cooked into it the cuisine and then the other one's just kind of like yeah I'll eat this uh it's lunch time that's the comparison now the beans the beans there's no competition you could taste each and every little thing the garlic the onion the chorizo the bacon it all comes through and the funny thing is they're putting those ingredients in their beans and yet somehow they taste like absolutely nothing but white distilled vinegar all right Kendrick come on in buddy uh what's your opinion on Chipotle I do not really eat at Chipotle it was a terrible person to choose to come up here okay so I'm gonna break this down into elements I'm gonna give you each element I want you to taste test them I'll give you one and two then you're gonna kind of vote on each element number one that's rice okay now masticate number two back to number one number one and then we're going back to number two last but certainly not least do you like beans what is your opinion on beans I like beans that's number one okay number two number two is the winner across the board Daniel Chipotle I'm just joking I'm just joking there's no way there's no way just to clarify we are the winner they're being bad like what you said it was just straight vinegar the rice was actually kind of close the texture of yours was way better but the flavor that's kind of similar the beef yours was definitely juicier but like Flavor wise was kind of similar so the number one lesson here is am I gonna stop ordering Chipotle actually no this is the first ferba better but if I actually want to sit down and have an enjoyable meal that is actually what it should have been in the first place then you're looking at what I would do you want to know what else has big piles of Papa's meat resting atop your bowl b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our burrito bowl wow gonna change into a different name maybe just Bowl it's just not a burrito at all why is that even in the title that aside we absolutely knocked this out of the park I wasn't sure how this was gonna go right because it's like oh it's rice meat beans and it's gonna taste the same not true with the effort and the love from your own heart taking the time to use the proper ingredients and season it the way you like it you're gonna have a better Bowl if you make it yourself that's what we should learn today and this is one of the few butt betters that you can actually execute at home that doesn't require loads of time and prep Etc enough of the excuses so that being said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and I will see you next time make the goddamn Bowl [Music]

Additional...",2022-11-26 21:59:44.386764, everyone wants to cook more everyone wants to be healthier so we're going to solve both of those [Music] all right so today we are making a cashew chicken this is a heart-healthy dish that the whole family loves maximize with flavor as much as possible but and this is a big juicy voluptuous butt i'm gonna do my best to keep this to a 15 minute maximum everything in the pan out of the pan on a plate in 15 minutes it's healthy you're cooking and it's saving you time wow you can venmo me i guess for this one because that's that's some value but with all that being said let's make this shall we right we got 15 minutes to toss together a cashew chicken no i'm not including rice cook time because it doesn't have to be served with rice or really anything for that matter but with that being said you'll need about two cups of uncooked white rice to have the perfect amount for this recipe which will serve four people of course you've properly washed your rice i'm not even describing it combine with two cups or 480 milliliters of water pop in the rice cooker listen to its joyous song and you have rice now we are ready get ready get set make sure your knees and plus is done and as soon as this clock strikes we have 15 minutes starting now right to keep this process as efficient as possible start with toasting your cashews obviously it's faster if you do this in a pan but if your oven is already preheated to 350 on convection like mine convenient pop those in for five to eight minutes or until those are roasty toasty while those are toasting let's get your chicken cooking get yourself one pound or 450 grams of boneless skinless chicken thighs none of that dry-ass chicken breast for this one cut those into three-quarter inch bite-sized pieces and season them to taste generously with kosher salt then in a wok heat up three tablespoons of oil over ripping high heat once hot pop in your chicken and let it sear for about six to eight minutes turning often until evenly browned and cooked all the way through now while that's searing we're gonna process our vegetables and make our sauce see now we have three active things happening two things cooking and one thing getting physically processed this is sort of how things are done in a restaurant for maximum efficiency now one bunch of green onion cut into one inch segments one rib of celery medium dice one green bell pepper cut the core out and dice into half inch chunks and optionally half a cup or 70 grams of water chestnut to cut into quarters i use fresh which are not conducive to time sensitivity due to the peeling but anyway once that's done rough chop four cloves of garlic and keep that pace here because that clock is got dang taken all right set all the veggie side and get your sauce made very very simple get a small bowl and combine one tablespoon or 16 grams of dark soy 1 tablespoon or 16 grams of regular soy sauce a third cup or 80 milliliters of chicken stock 1 tablespoon or 11 grams of chinese black vinegar 1 and a half tablespoons of 21 grams of rice vinegar 2 tablespoons or 33 grams of honey 1 tablespoon or 9 grams of corn starch a pinch of ground white pepper then just give that a [Music] right out the time is looking good so let's finish this baby chicken is done cashews are done remove the chicken from the wok and remove the cashews from the oven please don't remind me of those days in service when i had to watch you remove a sheet tray of fully blackened cashews it's a sad day in your wok add two to three tablespoons of vegetable oil get it nice and ripping hot add in your green onion sir fry those bad boys for about one minute or until you get a light char then add your chopped garlic in a 1 inch knob of ginger peeled and grated stir-fry for 30 seconds then add your celery and your green peppers stir-fry that aggressively for about one to two minutes or until your peppers begin to soften and you have an appropriate amount of undeniably important wok hay then enter chicken back along with your cashews and water chestnuts stir-fry for 30 seconds to a minute then add all of your stir-fry sauce allowed to come to a boil which should happen relatively instantly if it's hot enough and stir-fry for another 25 seconds or until thickened and glossy and you're done can we get a time check look at that right on the dot at 15 minutes including full vegetable prep and processing plus i also accidentally started chopping the ginger when i meant to grate it so that definitely didn't help the cook time here now you can just relax fill a bowl with hot steamed rice top with a generous portion of your cashew chicken and optionally finish with thin sliced green onion so that you can spend the majority of your time appreciating how delicious and beautiful this is now we might have hit the time marker but did we fully hit the flavor marker let's taste test wow 15 minutes obviously not including plating time and adding a little bit of garnish the point is that you made a beautiful cashew chicken let's see this is exactly the flavor the aroma that someone thinks of when they think of the perfect takeout cashew chicken right here in a bowl all of the flavors are there that you would expect but the fact that we've made it fresh the fact that we made with high quality ingredients high quality soy's no pre-made sauces you have the most maximized version of a cashew chicken undeniably fast and it's healthy you got healthy fats you got chicken everything's relatively low in sugar and a decent level of sodium i mean this is a perfect healthy dish in 15 minutes i'm tired of people complaining and saying cooking takes too long being healthy takes too long blah blah blah blah blah just take the time for god's sake god pace yourself do something you're proud of seek greatness and make this cashew chicken because god dang it if there's one step that will take you towards greatness this is bowl right here you want to know what else is full of glossy meats and nuts b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it let's talk about this cashew chicken this is no small feet little baby feet to formulate this much flavor in such a small amount of time and we got dang did it most things take a lot longer to generate this much flavor in one beautiful bowl ready to eat that you could serve with anything want rice cool you don't want rice you just want vegetables great you don't want vegetables you want to eat chicken that's fine this is a dish that is naturally good on its own don't you want to be good on your own you can do it i believe in you so with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you

Additional Cookbook Options (other stores, international, etc.):...",2022-11-26 21:59:44.386764, wow this is an abomination to italian cuisine really sorry italians but you've asked for it enough so we're gonna make the proper version [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today we're making the papa john's papadia dia papa making papa diaz wow look at that is this like a third wall breakage thing i i don't i don't think so so i've never had a papa dia but to me it looks like it's just a pizza a a mediocre one at that folded in half like some sort of weird fangled calzone that somebody made when they didn't have any idea what a calzone was but just imagine it they're like oh but maybe i'm being too harsh so let's go taste test it and make this shall we okay no drive-through today so how are we gonna do our three-point system i'm just gonna think about it papa john's what does it look like let me paint a picture there's a really sweaty guy outside and he's very red good lord the building is oddly clean on the outside but the inside is not just based off that painting i'll give it a 5 out of 10. menu well they have something called a papadia so we'll just go ahead and give that a zero just a zero thank you for calling papa john's all right well i've got you on hold let me ask you something what's the best part of a slice of pizza the answer is crust i don't like this kendrick you should not be liking this how is there a weight right now it's 107. all right well i've got you on hold let me ask you something you already did this all right well i've got you on the whole all right i genuinely think they're just not going to pick up their phones so as of right now the service is a zero out of four hundred thousand all right we're gonna call a different papa john's jesus christ hi uh i'd like to place an order for delivery it looks like you're just right outside our deliveries though you have a good day you too bye-bye let's have you list this order because i don't want to order it anymore hi hello can i order two papa diaz for pickup okay give him about 10 minutes okay why was that so much easier let's get around to a foster list thank you you listen it's finally here and it took a very long time this is the ugliest box i've ever received from a restaurant company in my entire life i've never seen one of these oh the anticipation oh my god this is just a small pizza folded in half whole pepperoncini appreciate that that's good stuff whoa spicy melon take a look inside all right regret doing that does this look like chicken to you vikram that looks like canadian bacon that's ham bon appetit it's not terrible but it's literally just a folded mediocre pizza with microwave bacon there are two onions on this entire sandwich at this point we're not even here to beat it we're just here to actually make what the product was supposed to be so we'll do that we're going with a modified less traditional sort of neapolitan dough to make this a little easier because you're going to fold the damn thing and low-key ruin it now please do me a favor and use grams pizza is made with love and also science in a large bowl combine 800 grams of double o typo flour that's an italian flour but you could also use all-purpose and 16 grams of fine sea salt no josh i don't want to use the grams these are all exact percentage parameters that i've created for you so hush papa's got you in a separate container mix 515 grams of water at around 95 fahrenheit with five grams of instant yeast once dissolved pour that into your flour mix mix that round to get a rough dough then knead by hand in that bowl until you get a smooth and extensible dough about three to five minutes generously grease a bowl shape your dough into a light ball plop it in there cover it tightly with plastic wrap with a respectable and correct name and rise at room temp for two hours then pop it in the fridge overnight wow movie magic and it's the next day put your dough down and separate into six even pieces around 235 to 250 grams each now roll those pieces of dough into thoit balls and place them in a proofing box or on our baking sheet generously coated with flour spaced evenly apart cover with a lid or another inverted baking sheet and proof for three to four hours at room temp now during those three hours i'd highly recommend you get your barbecue sauce creme fresh ranch your bacon and barbecued chicken ready first barbecue sauce in a medium saucepan add three quarters of a cup or 127 grams of light brown sugar three quarters of a cup 168 grams of ketchup a quarter teaspoon or half a gram of onion powder 1 tablespoon or 9 grams of smoked paprika one tablespoon or 12 grams of cholula hot sauce one tablespoon or 24 grams of molasses one tablespoon or 15 grams of worcestershire sauce yeah that's kind of right a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of white vinegar a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of water then give that a whisk and bring to a boil over medium-high heat reduce for one to two minutes cut the heat then season the taste with salt and two teaspoons or six grams of fresh ground black pepper finally pass it through a fine mesh strainer to get it real smooth and that is your bbq sauce right everybody loves ranch but it could be elevated with a little bit of in a medium-sized bowl add half a cup or 75 grams of paint just kidding please don't do that all right that's creme fraiche half a cup 105 grams of mayonnaise a quarter teaspoon or a half a gram of onion powder 1 tablespoon or 2 grams of fresh chopped dill one tablespoon or two grams of thinly sliced chives three cloves of grated garlic season a taste of salt and pepper and finally a third cup or 80 milliliters of buttermilk and then give that a nice [Music] incorporated and that is your greatest ranch with of course creme fraiche fresh now for the chicken it's as simple or complex as you want you'll need four booms skinless chicken thighs season however you want salt and pepper is fine but i added some of my cajun spice then just grill those bad boys in a grill pan gas grill or even a yakitori grill if you've got one flip constantly just until cooked through and the internal temp registers 165 fahrenheit and well that's it you could call it done at this point but i wanted these extra smoky and i've got a secret for you that i've never shown on here before this is compressed wood if you want to buy some that'll be linked in the description but it is magical so you'll need a deep or medium deep hotel pan a shallow perforated hotel pan and a lid or foil to cover here's how to use it place a piece of foil in the shape of a janky looking sort of bowl in the bottom of your non-perforated hotel pan add two to three one-inch chunks of your compressed wood place that on one side of your pan then pre-set your perforated pin on top of that now on the opposite side that the wood is placed add your chicken on then quickly lift your perforated pan and using a blowtorch blaze that brother up until it is well completely on fire and once it starts to smoke place your perforated pan back on cover with the lid or tightly wrap with foil and place in a ventilated area for 15 minutes and when that opens that chicken will emerge tasting like it came straight out of a roaring applewood fire grill of a mountain man's cooking lodge now once that's done slice your chicken into third inch thick pieces and place it to the side and yes it's fine if it gets cold it's gonna get heated when you bake it anyway now for the bacon sure you could just get store-bought pre-sliced bacon cook it regular you don't need me to explain that but we're better than that i got a whole fresh slab of smoked proper peppered bacon here which i sliced into a total of eight ounces of three-quarter inch cubes pop those beauties into a 12-inch cast iron pan set it over medium heat and cooked while constantly stirring until beautifully crisp and browned on all sides and the inside is undeniably juicy for the cheese mix you're going to combine 2 cups or 162 grams of smoked gouda 2 cups or 162 grams of monterey jack and half a cup or 40 grams of finely grated parmigiano-reggiano toss that together and it's a papadilla cheese for baking your pizzas i use my uni oven preheated to 700 to 800 fahrenheit don't worry we have an oven version too just pop a pizza stone or baking steel in your oven and preheat to the max oven temp for 45 minutes prior to baking also part of baking optionally make a quick garlic sage butter by melting half a cup or 112 grams of salted butter until melted and hot over medium heat cut off the heat then add three cloves of finely chopped garlic four sage leaves stir and let that sit for five minutes okay let's ship it a pizza sorry italians i had to get a piece of dough generously flour your work surface and your dough using your fist punch out all of its hopes and dreams leaving a quarter inch border all the way around the pizza that's the crust then grab the dough drape it over your fists allowing gravity to pull it down and shimmy the dough around and around as to stretch it evenly till you get a 12 to 14 inch piece of dough once that's done make sure the underside is appropriately floured so it slides off easily and first sauce your pizza with barbecue sauce probably about two to three tablespoons per pizza spread evenly then top with your cheese mixture be generous but not uh overzealous follow that with your bacon then your chicken just a touch more bbq drizzled on top some very thinly sliced sweet onion and a light drizzle of extra virgin olive oil then just take that there pie and launch it into your oven of choice but wait if it's in a proper pizza oven at 700 to 800 fahrenheit then bake for 25 seconds turn it 180 degrees and bake for another 25 seconds then immediately remove and that's it you gotta love a pizza oven now if it's a home oven version it'll take closer to four to seven minutes now won't taste or look quite as traditional or dramatic but it's still quite nice now as soon as that comes out of the oven brush the crust lightly with garlic sage butter all around that dough crust or crusty if you're speaking scientific terms then all you gotta do is gaze into the beauty of this pizza that you made and then desecrate what you have blessed forsake it to the depths of hell by folding it in half to make the peepee sorry i mean papa dia now although the folding hurts my soul just a little i think you can see which one might taste better but there's only one way to determine that look at this this is the papadia this is the fapadia first off look at the aeration the exterior has a crusty to it right oh my god is this so many miles ahead of this it's almost like a completely different object this is like the speaker turned on zero and this is the speaker turned all the way to the dough perfectly cooked chewy it's got the perfect level of saltiness the bacon itself i mean it's ridiculous it's like a gush ushigashi the smoked chicken thigh juicing and of course the perfectly umami mummy barbecue sauce we need a taste tester and it's going to be kendrick number one kendrick number two are you ready [Music] which one did you prefer one or two oh one one and done yours there was a lot more complexity to the flavors like hey the barbecue sauce like immediately just puts it over like easy win right so papa john's papa dia they never really stood a chance and as i've said many times in this world there's only room for one papa and his last name don't end with john's it ends with with weissman you want to know what else says papa's fat plump dough tightly folded before your very eyes b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our papadi yeah maybe if we put a little bit of an inflection there it might feel better even the version that i made felt like a disrespect to my own pizza when i folded it the second i folded it i was like damn but to be fair i have been to places in naples where they literally just make a quick marinara pizza they fold it put it in newspaper and you eat it and it's magnificent so maybe that's where the inspiration came here i'm not really sure but i will say that our version was significantly better and even without all the fixings like the garlic butter etc it's still gonna be better and that just goes to show that making a proper dough takes time and it is worth that time so with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time and when i say next time i mean in another video which is probably gonna be posted like a few days so keep your eyes [Music] you

Homemade garlic knots, korean style wings, sandwich bites,...",2022-11-26 21:59:44.386764, so if the big game is coming up and you didn't plan ahead you're probably due for a mediocre spread so let me give you a hand with that [Music] [Music] okay so today we are making the most ideal super bowl spread in my mind as quickly as possible i understand that a lot of the time it doesn't really make a lot of sense to pre-prep a ton of ingredients and a ton of different recipes just for one super bowl party so i thought you know there should be a version making this quickly but it's still actually good with homemade ingredients none of the store-bought stuff where you're going to the store and getting these huge platters of cheese that have all been sliced and sitting there for 14 days disco so we're gonna put three hours on the clock and see if we can make this entire thing in that amount of time so let's make this shall we we can easily do this in three hours then i'll be your shepherd so keep it clean orderly and move like you're in a restaurant if you will garlic nuts unbelievable wings chips with guac homemade queso shabbata sando bites and a luxurious cheese board so with that let's get our time check set the clock and begin one of our biggest bottlenecks is the time that it takes to rise our garlic knots so there's no question we have to start there with one tablespoon of 14 grams of instant yeast into one and a quarter cup or 300 grams of water that's around 95 fahrenheit then whisk in one egg yolk now you got yeasty egg water in a medium sized bowl add three and a half cups or 525 grams of all-purpose flour three-quarters of a teaspoon or three grams of amy lace which is an enzyme to soften the dough one and a half teaspoons or 11 grams of fine sea salt and three tablespoons or 42 grams of granulated sugar which together till combined add your yeasty egg to a stand mixer bowl fitted with a spiral thing begin mixing on medium low speed adding your flour about a quarter cup at a time until you have a rough dough and all your flour is added need for five minutes or till smooth then add two enough tablespoons or 35 grams of unsalted softened butter once that's incorporated mix for one more minute or till smooth and beautiful properly shape into a light ball and place into a grease bowl cover with plastic wrap give a very work appropriate name and that is your dough sit and rise at room temp till plump and doubled about one hour now full full stop you've got a full hour get all of your knife work out of the way okay that means chop your garlic slice your chilis dice your onions etc you see what i'm trying to say here if you don't do it then don't expect a kiss from now if you finish your knife work before that hour good work and in that case let's talk queso and guac for the queso get a medium-sized pot add two tablespoons or 25 grams of vegetable oil set over medium heat and add one thinly sliced serrano chili seeds and all okay don't be a baby in half of a diced yellow onion you'll use the other half in the guac now season that the taste with salt and sweat your veg stirring occasionally until just softened about two to three minutes then add one and a quarter cup or 295 grams of whole milk stir that just until thickened then add half a pound or 227 grams of grated cheddar cheese stir till melted then add half a pound or 227 grams of grated american cheese they could go all cheddar but you know mix the highs and lows on this one season your taste with salt and pepper and that is your queso for the guac i mean come on you don't really need a recipe for this right just at least do this in a mocha head day if you have one and if you don't go get one brother now to that you'll add two to three avocados obviously the skin and pit removed the zest of one lime lightly mash that to get it going but don't mash all the way all right don't get all ahead of yourself here add salt to taste a quarter bunch of cilantro finely chopped the juice of one lime half a finely diced onion see that's the other half the onion one finely diced jalapeno and one diced roma tomato mix all that together till mash to your liking and distribute it evenly adjust salt and acid levels as needed place into a bowl cover with plastic wrap and keep your cheese warm don't get all whiny if it thickens oh my god what just heat it back up and it will become liquid again then back to our dough degas that bad boy lay onto a lightly floured counter and shape into a rough rectangle that's about 14 inches long cut that perpendicular to the long side into 14 1-inch strips see what's happening 14 1-inch strips on a 14-inch log now take one of those strips roll roughly into a seven to eight inch log assuming you know what that looks like by heart then just tie that into a rough knot tucking the tails underneath the dough and place onto a baking sheet lined with greased parchment paper and repeat with all of your pieces of dough cover that lightly with another inverted baking sheet wrapped with plastic wrap proof at room temp for 30 minutes and while that's proofing make your garlic butter by melting down half a cup or 112 grams of unsalted butter once hot and melted cut the heat and add 4 sprigs of thyme and 4 cloves of finely chopped garlic stir together and well that's it it'll infuse in like 30 seconds don't heat it back up don't boil the butter the garlic will go bitter now very lightly brush your proof buns with your garlic butter reserving the majority for later and bake at 400 fahrenheit for 15 to 20 minutes or until baked and lightly browned like these lovelies pull them out and immediately toss into a bowl pour over all of your warm melted garlic butter hit that with smoked flaky salt or regular if you don't want to be mr fancy pants one cup or 95 grams of fresh grated parmesan reggiano a quarter cup or 20 grams of finely chopped italian parsley tossed together until evenly coated and those are proper garlic nuts that don't frown now there's a bunch of waiting between all that baking and tossing any waiting moments where you have more than 10 minutes make your cheese board this is the golden ticket to your time saving don't skip because i know you're thinking about it and that hurts my feelings get your cheeses and ah caught on camera the first time i've cut myself in ages no not when i was cutting the cheese reporting live from the sideline here with the man himself looks like you took a big hit out there josh how you feeling right now uh i got a boo boo now after kendra gave my band-aid a kiss i got right back to work because a cheese board depends on it now lay down your bree wedge as a whole slice slice up some manchego some gruyere rim against some castle veterano olives the world's favorite cheeseboard olive some sliced calabrese strawberry jam thinly sliced green pear and last but not least some crusty sourdough sliced thick toasted beautifully and cut on a bias now that's a got dang cheese board of course modify the amounts of each item on here based on the party size and if you want get a little creative pal almost there at this point we need to move on to our wings for the sauce give yourself two pounds or 900 grams of chicken wings and there better be some flats in here okay don't be the person that makes lame ass drum at only wings no good add two teaspoons or six grams of kosher salt one pinch of ground white pepper one tablespoon or eight grams of grated ginger tossed together listen to that symphony nice and for the sauce combine a quarter cup or 45 grams of gochujang link in the description for that if you don't have any three tablespoons or 48 grams of honey 3 tablespoons or 45 grams of ketchup 2 tablespoons or 40 grams of dark soy sauce 2 tablespoons or 19 grams of rice vinegar 2 tablespoons or 28 grams of mirin whisk that together bring that to a light boil for one minute once the sauce is off the heat add in four cloves of finely chopped garlic stir together and that is your sauce we'll fry our wings last so they're fresh now our last piece is well a sandwich yet another time-saving item so plight first let's begin with our pesto mayo add two bunches of basil in a blender a quarter cup or 32 grams of toasted pine nuts five cloves of garlic half a cup or 50 grams of finely grated parmesan oregano a third cup or 90 milliliters of water blend that on high until as smooth as possible you can always add a little more water to loosen if it's not blending then stream in a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of extra virgin olive oil very slowly and gradually until all of it's been added and you have a smooth glossy vibrant green sauce pour that into a bowl that contains one cup or 192 grams of mayonnaise stir to combine season a taste of salt and lemon juice as needed and that is your pesto assembly is very easily the rest is making a sandwich it's pretty basic get a whole loaf of shabata ideally a big boy good and half lengthwise sauce both sides generously stuck in this order starting on the bottom bun two balls of fresh mozzarella half a pound or 225 grams of salami four to five slices of provolone half a pound or 225 grams of mortadella a quarter head of iceberg lettuce thinly sliced pickled banana peppers to your heart's desire and naturally crown your hefty long king that's the sandwich for a big boy if you have enough people coming to the big game i would double this once you have your sandwiches simply cut that into as many little segments as you want you want big segments great small segments great that's how you serve a big sandwich to a big crowd ah checking the time we're looking beautiful now we just have to fry our wings and hit this home run wait that's uh baseball right sorry about that in a large bowl with one cup or 165 grams of cornstarch add all of your wings toss to coat completely and gently submerge half your wings into fry oil preheated to 325 fahrenheit and fry for five minutes or just till cooked through and very lightly golden remove and drain on a wire rack and repeat with the other half batch once that's done crank the heat up to 375 toss your rings back in and if you have room for all of them since they might have shrunk by now great but please be careful fry for two to three more minutes or till crisp and golden brown remove pop into a bowl add all of your sauce and toss until completely coated like a glistening wand of gochujang ready to cast a spell on your tingling tongue now let's have our final time check coming in at precisely three

This rice bowl is not only low calorie and cheap, but it’s also beautifully gourmet. 

Rice Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?...",2022-11-26 21:59:44.386764, we're all trying to be healthier but it's expensive you know the calories we're going to solve both of those problems today with this price this caloric count not that we're counting calories and that is but cheaper [Music] okay so today we're making the perfect rice bowl that is also healthy isn't that beautiful this is closer to what i eat every day a lot of people like josh it's impossible you can't be cooking all this food and still somehow maintain somewhat of a healthy body that's because i don't eat that every day well i guess i kind of do but i only have a little nibble but it really is closer to what i eat on a daily basis a little bit of rice a little bit of protein and then you mix and match different sauces textures vegetables things should be delicious if they're prepared properly if it's not delicious you up granted i think the whole calorie counting thing is a little bit overrated but we're including it because lots of people have asked and i'm trying to make this a little easier so with all that being said let's make this shall we if i've said it once i've said it 300 732 times you cannot have a good rice bowl without good rice get yourself three cups or about 630 grams of medium grain or short grain rice and wash it by placing it in a large fine mesh sieve set over a large bowl fill it all the way up with water agitate it pour out the water and repeat one to two more times lightly drain the rice pop it into a rice cooker and i know this is but cheaper so if you don't have a rice cooker first off moment of silence second you can use my guide for the many ways to cook rice which is in the link in the description if you can't get one yet anyway add three cups or 710 milliliters of water to your rice finger test to ensure that's correct close and turn on your cooker and you have beautifully cooked rice next up spicy peanut sauce underrated and extremely easy to a small pan add 3 tbsp of 42 grams of granulated sugar three tablespoons or 50 grams of soy sauce two and a half tablespoons or 36 grams of white vinegar stir and heat that just till dissolved a lot of cool slightly then mix in two tablespoons or 33 grams of sriracha along with three quarters of a cup or 229 grams of smooth peanut butter and one clove of garlic grated whisk all that together and this part is important depending on your peanut butter you may have to whisk in a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of water and one teaspoon or four grams of cornstarch if it begins to seize a bit and separate but anyway once it's done it should look something like this this does make quite a bit of sauce so keep it in the fridge and thank me later pal you can't be grilling no dry ass chicken without some sort of a nice glaze so here's a simple one get a small pot ideally a little man like this add a quarter cup 67 grams of soy sauce a quarter cup or 55 grams of white vinegar and three and a half tablespoons or 53 grams of honey pop that onto a stove over medium high bring to a boil and reduce for one minute being proactive you should make a slurry while that's going by combining two teaspoons or eight grams of corn starch and two teaspoons or nine grams of water whisk until dissolved once you're done simmering add about three quarters of your slurry stir it in let it boil for 30 seconds or till thickened and if it's reached sort of like a teriyaki glaze like thickness don't add any more slurry and it is done but of course if it's still thin add the rest now just set that to the side for grilling your chickie in a second now a rice bowl isn't made special by the glorious peanut allergy heavy sauces it's also made with the other textural elements that you lay atop your rice first up my classic soft boiled eggs everyone seems to be oh so mystified by how i do these look it's very basic get a pot of boiling water over medium-high heat then just slightly reduce the temp so it's a gentler less violent boil add in four whole eggs and let those boil for exactly 6 minutes and 30 seconds immediately removed from the water and placed into an ice bath cool just until they're warm but not hot about 5 minutes then gently crack the shell all over the egg peel them under a light stream of water this will really help get that shell off of there then cut it in half to reveal a gentle dribble of liquid gold encased by a perfectly cooked egg free cucumber it's real easy either slice it into coins or if you're a real g cut your cuke in half then slice it a mandolin lengthwise to get pepperdill like slices very fine dining of you last but not least your carrots simply julienne one to two large carrots and toss that together with salted taste the juice of one lime half a teaspoon or three grams of sesame oil and toss together until evenly coated these are shockingly delicious so please understand that unseasoned carrots or really any food for that matter is 100 not pee last but not least one avocado halved quartered peeled and then sliced into quarter inch slices optionally hit it with a touch of flaky salt and lime juice and last but not least let's talk about our beautiful yakitori chicken first cut six boneless skinless chicken thighs into one inch pieces skewer them onto wooden skewers and you should end up with about six to eight total skewers lightly grease those chicken pieces with spray oil season them generously with salt and pepper on all sides then just preheat a grill to medium-high heat in our case we decided to use a conroe yakitori style grill with bean chotan coals because the flecks anyway once hot grease your grill place on your skewers and let those cook for about 5-10 minutes turning every minute or so and as soon as they're cooked all the way through with a beautiful deep browning and some nice light char brush them on all sides with your glaze and then blast them on high heat to caramelize that glaze deeply under the chicken then immediately remove from the grill to prevent burning and repeat with all of your skewers i mean look at these somehow the appearance of these encapsulates all human desire on one skewer let's assemble first get a nice bowl this recipe makes enough for four to six people so fill that brother up with the desired amount of rice followed by one to two of your chicken skewers per plate gently lay atop your carrots then decide you didn't like where that was so scoot them over a bit then lay on your cucumber nicely on the plate next up one to two halves of our perfectly soft boiled eggs a small handful of thinly sliced green onion a generous dollop of your spicy peanut sauce you can optionally add some crushed toasted peanuts on top of that peanut sauce see how much better that looks and then your avocado because you almost forgot it and lastly if you have any leftover glaze give your chicken a tiny extra drizzled atop it's glistening skewer then get ready to sit down to no ordinary rice bowl this is a full-blown eating experience that will leave you feeling like a triathlete with the strength of 10 000 men or maybe you'll feel relatively nice i don't know now let's taste test and see how good this really is right a healthy rice bowl if anyone's wondering for the sake of the photo and the b-roll of course i fill this out with rice this is not a single serving the vegetables and meat are but the rice is like three times that skewer first it is perfect the chicken beautifully moist but that binch on grill obviously not everyone has a pizza ton you do it in a pan you can do it on a grill it's up to you but this has that nice smoky flavor with the sweetness of the teriyaki sauce but we made it a little lighter sugar all right it's not super sugary but it still has that acidic soy thrust if you will and if your soft boiled egg ain't doing this don't give me a goddamn phone call the rest of this obviously you can mix all together you can eat this how you want one element at a time with a little bit of rice in between each bite or you can take all the chicken off and mix it all together with a peanut sauce oh yeah this is the addition you want with all this being so low calorie the peanut sauce gives it some body some density so it's not all light but you can go as hard on the peanut sauce if you want or as light on the peanut sauce as you like it has all the textures all the flavors you want it's deliciously satisfying all for a humble price of this right here and a caloric count of this right here and thank your lucky stars because you don gun made this raspberry or you can just go to hell i don't care you want to know what else has sticky meat laying atop your bowl b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our perfect rice bowl for the perfect price the perfect level of health if i would serve this at a restaurant i wouldn't think about the health aspect of it or the calorie aspect of it i would just be focusing on how utterly delicious and perfect it is and if you want to make a little naughty throw some pork belly on there it'd be pretty good so with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or

Nico's Channel!: https://www.youtube.com/chann...",2022-11-25 21:59:44.386764, most of the people we've had on here can cook relatively simple things but what about somebody who doesn't cook at all cooking the most basic things [Music] as i said earlier stop laughing nico is a beginner he literally facetimes me to ask me questions while he is boiling eggs yes you made nachos and you've made eggs i was very proud of my nutshells to be fair i just bought a bag of doritos and some sauce there is a winner there is a loser but it's not about you winning it's just more so can you keep up with me we're going to be challenging you to cook the most basic simple things i can possibly imagine i'm going to try to match my speed as best you can but and i say this with a heavy butt you will not be able to see anything that i'm doing you can only go by verbal instructions so i can't just that is unfair cue funeral music i'm not i'm not that tall mate it can be lower like hello oh my god peeking i can i can i i know why you put up this curtain because you don't want to see my masterpiece we're doing three different items number one grilled cheese number two omelette the third one is going to be a pork katsu with a cabbage slaw what the are you talking about we're all gonna learn something today i don't think i'm gonna learn anything about cooking but i think i'm gonna learn something about nico if you were able to at least keep up or beat me in any of these i will wear a max for stopping shirt for one month straight you should do that in general anyway if you can't keep up with me at all no the answer is no it's not happening it's not happening you have to go and wear a hue blow no it's not happening what the i will beat you anyway i represent the people that can't quick all right let's do this this is a floppy thing what do you do with this what is he holding a rubber spatula you've never seen a rubber spatula sorry milk from the irish grass-fed cows i'm happy i'm ready come on bread on your cutting board slice it yourself and then you're going to get your irish butter as a matter of fact yes put it in the pan turn the pan on to medium heat power level needs to be anywhere between 800 and 1200 you do tablespoons we do have tablespoons two tablespoons with probably half the bloody butter yes what power level are you at good lord 1200 that sounds fine bread in the pan so one slice of bread in the pan and then on the bread a slice of cheese and then the other cheese smells nice to be fair see i think that's a good sign right this one's nice sorry are you eating right now no no no no no um i like to melt my cheese a little bit before i add the second slice of bread on top here's the blow torch please be careful i'm actually scared ah there we go i've got my second slice going on the bread now i'm gonna go ahead and flip mine now boom flip it put a little more butter in the pan after you flip it underneath it's this is supposed to be the easy one nico don't tell me no you cheated by saying i put it on 1200 or something i'll do it at 800. you can always turn down the temperature if you need to to avoid it yeah you say that now i'm burning on the other side what am i doing here what am i doing you know the information now now you can't you can't use that as a way out oh yeah ah all right cheese grilled cheese coming off what is going on how is everyone laughing this hard there's no way we're making a grilled cheese would you say that you're done i burnt my fingers i'm done it looks like you ran this through a bag of charcoal and just fiddled this around in there or something reveal your sandwich nico come on i like mine a bit better the cheese pull that's a good grilled cheese now let's see your cheeseburger yeah my mind doesn't have that but it does it does have a bit of color it is thin yeah i tried to make it very thin why looked better the presentation is important i'm poisoning you why does it smell herbaceous you hear that crunch nico because you're my friend i will not spit this out if i got this at a restaurant i would definitely have something to say to somebody but you kept up so i would call that a w but we're giving niko a w i'm gonna die bro guy have you ever made an omelette not really i'm a mama's boy you see what i mean no i don't i don't you can order food on every app in the world but you would prefer an omelette that is sat in somebody's car for 30 minutes before you got to eat it no i prefer to have my own omelette but i can't cook for nothing you're going to need a bowl i don't have bowls use your eyes yes butter in the pan you need to lower it you can always do that how do you know when you need to raise or lower something if it's burning you should lower it three eggs into the bowl i'm going with four eggs because my pans a little bit larger than yours shut up okay exactly slow down i'm i'm with my first egg oh my lord no shells i'm currently at zero shells now i'm seasoning my eggs with salt relax relax right so so so risking whisking whisking how's he doing how i think i put too much butter in the pot the butter's hot yes eggs going into the pan i'm hot yes as this is cooking you're gonna bring your eggs to the center and let the excess egg i'm not really sure how to do this but we'll be all right we're going to pull some of that cooked egg towards the center and then you're going to it's already in the center this is like magic made egg unbelievable i'm a provo i told you don't underestimate me like how do you know if your egg is cooked it should be cooked how do you know i just know it needs to be a point where you just add cooked grate your cheese on half of your egg oh you berate it yeah that's why that thing was here you have a big one so you should be in a good one i make it such a mess i feel bad so i have black pepper i'm gonna add a little bit to the inside where that cheese is take jesus i have this on the control man what are you talking about you're gonna take the side that does not have cheese and you're going to carefully fold that over itself cover up the cheese we have it folded over now we need to let that cheese melt so while that's folded you're going to take a little bit more butter another knob if you will a small knot prepared for that yep drop your knob of butter in there spread that butter on the underside of the omelette and you're going to carefully lift the pan tilt the pan towards you you say that one more time lift it up so that the butter falls underneath the omelet now we're toasting the other side of it is your omelet done yeah it's done this is how you flip it out of the pan you got to do it quickly because i can smell yours burning right now you're going to take finished what are you talking about he's out okay well i'll just do mine and you flip crack black pepper what are you doing that mate i was already done five minutes ago are you ready to taste and present your omelet i got this you sound really confident i'm actually excited to see it you're doing great so far i'm very very proud of you i think this is double um it looks good it looks good that looks like the monster from stranger things it's a bit more exotic here's what i'll say aside from the fact that it is not an omelette why is this normal this is a disgrace to jacques this is not bad if i ordered an omelet and i received this at a restaurant i would post it on social media i've never smelled an egg that smells like this exactly i am original modern interpretation of the mona lisa in an egg yours look a bit boring and tidy and stuff with that being said though this does look like good there are elements of this look that have tasty qualities okay i mean you cook the egg what's what's wrong with that right it's not fun exactly i'm a pro tastes exactly the same as the 35 egg i had earlier let's make 35 for an egg in my hotel i did feel a bit abused it was great presentation no flavor wise on the other hand it's there it's good texturally it's good so all in all you're you're doing pretty good i know single-handedly the ugliest omelet i've ever seen in my life i don't know how to pull this off it's best out of three already one so what are you talking about three challenges two w's you can only lose it is what it is okay next winner takes all how about that oh we're nothing all or nothing ah i thought this was my name because i saw it on the other way around there's an n there's a c i thought it was nico but it says cancun i don't know why i'm wearing this one but it's very colorful what have you learned or maybe nothing i definitely learned that i need to use less butter sometimes more butter is a good thing all right now then i've learned absolutely nothing yes the pork katsu with a cabbage slaw very very very simple very very basic you're gonna have to actually use knife skills you have to understand how to fry something properly without it being raw in the center i don't know what a culture is a japanese fried pork cutlet yes i'm gonna make a schnitzel out of these green cabbage this is green yep is it also cabbage though there's a lot of green stuff in here i don't know what this is i need you to identify green cabbage slice like about a quarter of that head into very very very thin strips now i've done that i've got my carrot julienne into three inch strips so think about the size of your you know okay cut the edges off of it and then you're going to cut that into sort of like an eighth of an inch planks planks okay let's cut those planks into strips you see what i'm seeing what i'm saying that's going to go in it's all it's all a matter of perspective it's your lemon so next get your microplane and zest your lemon into your slaw let's say that again do i just do the shell the shell use the skin yes the whole skin salt goes in that uh bowl of chili stuff a tablespoon of that in there we'll add a little more salt if we need it cut your lemon lemon goes in and i'm just going to toss all those ingredients together i'm still stroking my lemon why would you not put the lemon in why do you put the shell in i don't get that did you not put the juice in the juice goes in too is he choking or my slaw is problem solved joshua i just cut my finger help i know you didn't this looks like a leek do you do the the sticks as well the leaves the leaves doesn't look like leaves or what you're not gonna cut the stem with with the uh with the fronds on it no my green onions sliced you just go on i'll get you in the next round cut a segment of your cucumber cut the cucumber in half slice your cucumber as thinly as you can cooking is painful make my back do my adding so you should have three bowls total what what did you say say that again are you eating right now no put the panko in the square container i knew that already so he didn't did i or did i not flour in the medium sized bowl add two of your whole eggs salt your eggs just a little bit one one second salt salt salt beat your eggs together get your pork you're gonna just cut it off the bone a boneless pork now you need to flatten it so i'm gonna get you a little a little the sound of it is unbelievable i'm like a butcher pork's gonna get seasoned with salt coat it on both sides with the flour shake off the excess flour then into the egg make sure it's completely coated in the panko this is easy it's very easy what the mess mate look at my desk cucumbers and everything disgusting get your pork please be careful gently lay it in and lay away from you it's in the oil made my whole creation is gone i'm gonna get you a spider i don't like spiders mate let it fry it's going to take time to fry i'm going to get us some plates nico's been drinking tequila since 10 am i'm honestly shocked with the level of coordination that he has easy mate you're an amateur it's all about presentation so fancy plates gonna blow your mind i'm flipping my pork gently carefully remove your pork katsu from the oil oh season it with salt and then your togarashi what is the dough butter also that's the seasoning do you throw that whole sausage on it i do you know if i knew i don't know what you're saying i almost said this you know what the good thing is i don't have to taste it he does i want you to cut it as evenly as humanly possible place it on your plate one second randomized dots josh could you tell me you know we're not playing a little bit about sweetie josh anymore a little bit about taxes my cabbage and that's going to go right next to the katsu beautifully you're going way too fast and humility it's good only use your nice pieces of cucumber and that's sort of spread evenly across our plate okay i have so many issues i lost you so i'm gonna do whatever i'm gonna do the nico version very nice you're gonna take some of your chili oil and then just lightly gonna go around the so we have our plates do you want to make any adjustments to your plate are you ready no it's all done uh i lost you there in the last bit yes you did i made my own creation for you because you're going to taste mine i really don't know what to anticipate by i do i let's see how accurate you were what is that i mean what is that it's beautiful it's right it's lack of creativity mate are you ready for this are you ready there you go wait oh my god what is that this looks like lunchables the pork looks really overcooked how is that possible i put it in this exactly the same way i don't know that's it cheating again so see how this is this is dry yeah there you go you saw mine i see yours it's exactly the same it's not exactly right how do you think you did i think i've done a solid seven out of ten a solid because the most important thing is the pork and the pork is on the plate i always wanted to try your food for me that's a good portrait i nailed it again the pork is actually seasoned pretty nicely it's not it's not perfect okay sloth that's an important one i really like that one man that's very nice pretty sure there's a hair in here i know if i throw up after this that's what made it this is the kind of thing where when you go to a restaurant and then you eat everything but one item this would be that item i'm not going to eat any more of it because i don't know where the hair is there i think i ate it i honestly think that i ate the hair so the finalized judgment here you you done pretty well i'm not gonna lie this plane is a disgrace but it tastes unreal it does not taste unreal it tastes passively good when you eat this when you finish this plate at the end of the evening are you still alive and are you not sick yes or no eating to survive that's it that's not what this is do you die after eating this yes or no i don't know we're gonna find out later exactly solid seven out of ten so all things considered this is a marginal win and the only reason i feel like it's a marginal one is only because i've been doing this professionally for my entire life and nico's somebody who has never cooked before for the most part one way or another whether we want to laugh about it or not and be like oh they made it it's not even funny it's serious like the actual execution of it was not incorrect and i didn't eat it and hate it i actually thought it was good so i think at the end of the day what we learned is that anybody can cook with the right incentive and for you it was fear listen to be fair i've always been scared cooking it's not the case that i'm going home now and all of a sudden start cooking [Laughter] no chance but this is really cool to see something developing on the plate if nico can do it stop bullshitting stop complaining about it and if you don't want to cook you don't want to clean well then don't don't cook i want to do this again but i'm only going to cook in this kitchen i like this kitchen because i don't have to clean in here told you w's no bother good work today nico it was a pleasure to have you thank you so much for coming i can't good friend of mine i'm coming with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like

Perfectly juicy birria, homemade telera bread, and a consome so good you could practically drink it, which you probably...",2022-11-25 21:59:44.386764, i've eaten a lot of sandwiches in my life and if there's one that's ever made me speechless this is it [Music] okay so today we're making a very specific tortoise sandwich obviously we're making the bread so i want to point out that this can be applied to many different kinds of meats you don't have to do the birya you could do whatever you want but i would recommend that you start here if you want a goddamn drop your drop well maybe not drop your drawls but this is a meal where you sit down you eat and you're not getting up afterwards due to the immense amount of well galleries we could just do plain beer on here but we're gonna wrap our beer in a cheese crust and that is what makes this sandwich special this isn't a diet show so with all that being said let's make this shall we as i've said this is no ordinary torta let alone a sandwich we have our homemade telera big dub what you need to pay attention to is this cheese crust encased ultra juicy beeria so let us begin now contrary to how we usually start with homemade breads i'd actually recommend that you start with your berea it's mostly the same as my original beer recipe link in the description but because i'm a sweetie pie i'm going to give you a quick run down anyway i do want to notate that this whole sandwich recipe including the berea will make enough for six to eight people first begin with a seven to ten quart pot add enough oil to coat the bottom heat it over medium high until it's as hot as me and short shorts then sear one pound or 450 grams of boneless chuck roast three big short ribs and one and a half pounds or 675 grams of oxtail once all that's beautifully browned remove from the pot and add one chopped yellow onion and eight cloves of rough chopped garlic saute why does it smell so good in here starter pack season a taste of salt and once softened add 1 tablespoon or 12 grams of tomato paste continue to cook till the tomato paste starts to caramelize in the bottom of the pan or well pot in this case add your sachet consisting of one tablespoon or eight grams of black peppercorns one tablespoon or seven grams of coriander seeds six bay leaves and one cinnamon stick wrapped in tide in cheesecloth so nothing falls out because that would literally defeat the entire purpose of this tea bag that sachet goes into the pot followed by two and a half quarts or roughly two and a half liters of rich beef stock and five sprigs of fresh oregano stir that and set to medium high bring to a boil then reduce the heat to low to a light simmer add all your beef back in a mix of five inch of chilies and five guajillo chilies which have both been deceited instead of a lid i like to add a cartouche but if you don't want to be squillium fancy son like me then you can use the lid now just simmer that for one hour remove all your chilies place into a blender along with about a pint or 450 milliliters of cooking liquid blend that on high until smooth as possible add back to your pot stir lightly to avoid tearing the meat out bring back to a simmer on low heat and allow that to simmer and reduce for one and a half more hours and it's done remove your ridiculously tender beef discard all the bones then using gloves or two forks shred the meat as fine as possible and yes please dear god include the fat so mix it all together with the meat to create what i'd call the epitome of moist i don't care if you don't like the word okay it's descriptive now ladle in a splash of your broth to your beef season the taste with salt and you're done now if you want to be efficient with your time you can also make your telera bread while your meat is simmering considering you have three hours to do so but of course either can be made a full day of header time if needed start with one and a half cups or 375 grams of water at 95 fahrenheit whisk in one tablespoon or 14 grams of instant yeast until dissolved let that sit for five minutes then whisk in one tablespoon or 17 grams of honey separately in a medium sized bowl whisk together four and a half cups or 675 grams of all-purpose flour with one and a half teaspoons or 10 grams of fine sea salt add your tasty juice to your stand mixer set the mixing speed to medium-low and add your flour one large spoonful at a time till all that's added then once it begins to form a dough add one and a half tablespoons or 23 grams of lard or bacon grease if you want to be ultra naughty and just let that mix for five minutes or until you get a beautifully smooth dough give it a couple more needs by hand roll it into a light bowl and place in a grease bowl cover with plastic wrap name your little man and rise for one hour or till doubled no of course essentially caress your dough then punch it down to thoroughly degass it dump it onto a lightly floured work surface and cut into six even pieces obviously you can go for eight if you want more medium-sized tortoise but just stop playing and make them big it's what everyone wants form those pieces into light balls and let them rest for five minutes then roll each ball into a rough cylinder about seven inches in length tapering the ends then using a grease straw press two indentations lengthwise equally spaced apart into the dough this does two things it flattens and widens the dough but it also creates that classic telera shape now place your finished dough onto a baking sheet lined with greased parchment paper and repeat with the rest of your dough you should be able to fit these on two baking sheets i tried to fit all six on one and granted it's possible but it would be a lot better if it was three by three cover that with an inverted baking sheet then wrapped in plastic wrap or you know just greased plastic wrap and let that proof at room temp for 25 minutes or till puffed and nearly double spray with water and pop into an oven that's been preheated to 400 fahrenheit for 15 to 20 minutes or until you pull out beautifully smooth golden brown telera breads now these look rather simple but the interior is softer than a cloud and the exterior is airy and crisp truly the perfect bread for this application let this cool to room temp and we're almost at assembly time of course we need to have a yum yum sauce super simple come on three quarters of a cup 185 grams of mayo a quarter cup or 60 grams of sour cream two teaspoons or five grams of chipotle powder a quarter teaspoon or one gram of cumin powder two tablespoons or 30 grams of cholula hot sauce and three cloves of garlic grated season that tastes with salt and pepper whisk together and that is your yum [Music] before assembly make sure you got your mies and plos two tomatoes sliced somewhat thin one sweet onion finely diced one head of iceberg lettuce very thinly sliced and two perfectly ripe avocados sliced into half-inch pieces hit with a little bit of regular or smoked flaky salt and finished with lime juice now for the secret in the moment you've been waiting for instead of just tossing a heaping stack of your meat on your bread we're gonna wrap it in a crispy oak and cheese crust you'll need at least four cups of shredded oaxaca cheese but extra is always good heat a dry 12 inch non-stick pan over medium heat sprinkling just enough cheese to coat the bottom of the pan let that melt and then continue to cook fluctuating the heat up and down as needed until the underside of the cheese is beautifully browned and crisp about 2-4 minutes and sprinkle a nice line of your diced sweet onion a light sprinkling of fresh chopped cilantro and then layer in enough beef for one sandwich roughly in the same shape of your talara bread then carefully wrap your cheese around the meat to fully encase it sort of like a burrito and that's it it should hold together quite well if you did it correctly and you have a cheese crusted birya in all of its shiny cheesy glory now get your telara cut it in half brush the cut sides with your berry of beef fat toast it in a pan till crisp and nice spread on a generous amount of your yum yum sauce on both sides of the bread then on the bottom slice add your avocado to your heart's desire some slices of tomatoes which of course were salted don't try to add me here alright a nice stack of your refreshing shreddes and finally in betwixt those worlds of flavor is your baton of cheese encased perfection now carefully crown your king get a sharp knife slice it in half and wow you have a sandwich that isn't just world class but one bite is for sure to send you out of the planet and into another dimension of flavor that i can't sit idling by without you having a taste so grab a bowl of consummate topped with onion and fresh chopped cilantro dunk your sandwich with tears welling up in your eyes and enjoy a core memory causing bite now let's taste test this to see if we may have created the greatest sandwich of all time i don't even think this is a high claim to say that this is one of the greatest sandwiches that we've ever made in the history of really anything i have immense love and adoration admiration adoration for the toita a beautiful creation that anything can be put in really but if there's anything that it should be it should be cheese crisp rap mate a dunk yeah holy sh this is ridiculous funny enough it's actually not too rich my concern was this is gonna be too rich give me two fatty this is perfectly balanced the acidity the spice the saltiness the fatty beef oozy the juicy juicy squirt squirt is so unbelievably present this is the greatest sandwich we've ever made on this channel period and the story and i mean that to the fullest extent of the law i think we should have someone come in here and eat this kevin wants to eat it kevin do you like naughty naughty naughty naughty naughty oh so naughty sandwiches that's what i order and most of the time they look at me weird kevin was on the channel in the humble beginnings and uh we saw some stuff in his own home and somehow that led to him working here what a success story so now it's all brought you to this very moment to eat this sandwich wow what a bite oh if i can have the rest of this sandwich i will quit my job and come work for you you heard it here one of the greatest things i've ever heard in my life yes you actually can have the rest of the sandwich i can i lifted a few inches off the ground when i was chewing it and then as i swallowed i like came back down to the earth so it's sort of like each bite it's a sassy this is insane yeah it's dumb long story short food should not taste that good this is the greatest sandwich you'll ever make in your entire life and i know i see that kind of stuff all the time but this really will change your life and you'll probably have to change your pants afterwards you want to know what else has big mounds of papa's hot meat b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our most perfect most beautiful most sensuous tortoise sandwich and i feel like we just keep one-upping ourselves because we recently did the french tip which if you haven't seen links in the description quick plug right there this is even better than that obviously there's a lot of wait time with the cooking and waiting for it to rise if you combine waiting for the bread to rise and waiting for the meat to braise it's really not that bad okay stop complaining and just take the time it takes to make something utterly delicious and special now with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time my voice is kind of strange from yelling all week at people who don't do things right [Music] you

With fresh buttermilk biscuits, crispy homemade pan sausage, the fluffiest eggs, we’re gonna make it that way. 

Get My Cookbook: http://bit.ly/JW...",2022-11-25 21:59:44.386764, so many people have asked me to do this and i've held off on it because i think it's one of the worst items on mcdonald's menu i mean they're all terrible but this is the worst so of course we're gonna turn it into the best [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today we're making this is the actual name the mcdonald's sausage biscuit with egg look at those words i don't have anything to say about that this one paints itself the first order of business is a to put cheese on it because why would that not be standard and secondarily we're gonna be making the perfect breakfast sausage ground from scratch of course we're making the most classy traditional buttermilk biscuits from scratch and then putting it all together into what i think would be the most ideal biscuit breakfast sandwich and with all that being said let's make this shall we nothing more american than the american flag followed by a sign of mcdonald's here we are mcdonald's yet again with a three-point test now the building it's a mcdonald's building so that loses points but it's well kept so i'll give it a 5 out of 10. hi can i just get the sausage biscuit with an egg and can you add cheese to that as well okay thank you look at this look at all of these signs there's so much going on i just want my sausage biscuit with kendrick is making such a good point this is a multi-billion dollar corporation and how are they solving this road signs that you see for people that are like i will buy your house any house i'll buy it thank you so much appreciate it you too all in all very sweet service was good so service is actually always pretty good here give that one an 8 out of 10. to route back to the menu rating give that one out of 10. actually you know what i'll give it a 2 out of 10 because the actual things that are on the menu are pretty common and understood to be good they're just not good here so right now so we've got the bag you know this is a lot better design monogram your logo it's like the gucci of mcdonald's good donald's this what y'all after you know what's funny it does not come on the menu with cheese just says sausage biscuit with egg i can't even talk about the flavor right now because i almost ran out of breath because of how raw that is it's like that meme that's like popeye's biscuits this is single-handedly the toughest driest biscuit i've ever put in my mouth in my entire life the sausage itself is the worst part the egg is just like a sponge so long story short this should be a breakfast that you cherish not one that you want to take to the grave so we're gonna do that not not take it to the grave cherish it for the record shockingly this is one of the easiest but better sandwiches we've ever made let's talk biscuits and look all good biscuit requires is a little bit of love care and a lot of butter now preheat your oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit then in a medium sized bowl add two and a half cups or 375 grams of all-purpose flour one teaspoon or seven grams of fine sea salt one and a half tablespoons or 17 grams of granulated sugar in one tablespoon or 11 grams of baking powder whisk all that till thoroughly combined now to your flour you'll add three quarters of a cup or 170 grams of very cold unsalted butter that's been cut into half inch cubes and i repeat cold this brother was cubed and left in the fridge until ready to use then using a pastry blender or a fork cut your butt into your flour until you get pea-sized balls pee balls if you will then using a fork store in one cup or 240 milliliters of a nice buttermilk and as soon as you get a very rough shaggy dough dump it out onto a work surface and very lightly knead it until it comes together the more you touch the dough the more you ruin it now gently roll your dough till it's a rough rectangle fold it like a letter folding it into thirds that overlap then roll it out one more time until you get a rough rectangle that's about three quarters of an inch thick then using a four inch biscuit cutter cut out as many pieces as you can and place this on a baking sheet lined with greased parchment paper oh josh i have leftover dough and i want to waste please help well guess what take the trim and gently push it back together and knead until combines roll it out again and punch out more biscuits until all of your dough has been used you should end up with six beautiful and massive biscuits lightly brush the top of those bad boys with extra buttermilk and pop them into your preheated oven for 12 to 14 minutes or until they're beautifully golden brown and optionally while they're still hot brush the tops with melted butter and hit them with a light sprinkling of flaky salt i'm using smoked flaky salt for the full flex then just let those bad boys cool to room temp on a wire rack and yes that's all you need to make a glorious biscuit that shimmers in the light moving on to breakfast sausage you want breakfast sausage that you think about for breakfast lunch snack one two three and dinner so you gotta make it yourself first snag yourself two pounds or 907 grams of ground pork which of course i'm grinding myself and if you want to as well you'll need two pounds of boneless boston butt roast cut into pieces that fit your grinder nicely to that you'll add eight sage leaves finely chopped one tablespoon or four grams of fresh thyme leaves also finely chopped half a teaspoon or half gram of cayenne powder one and a half teaspoons or three grams of fennel powder half a teaspoon or three grams of m two and a half teaspoons or 18 grams of fine sea salt one tablespoon or 11 grams of light brown sugar and a pinch of fresh nutmeg toss all that together until thoroughly combined or if you're using pre-ground pork you'll need it together and grind that through your meat grinder once until all of its ground and then one more time to get it extra emulsified and fine again knead that lightly and you have your breakfast sausage ready to become a discus of flavor this breakfast sausage can be cooked like any other but i prefer to treat it more like a smash burger so get a lightly greased pan screaming hot over medium high roll your meat into balls at around four ounces depending on how thick ems you want them then place it in the center of your pan press with a spatula or a burger press until about a quarter of an inch thick and sear for one to two minutes flip sear on the other side for another minute or till cooked through and beautifully browned and you have a sausage that makes six to eight patties depending on their size and the beautiful aroma to enjoy keep your meats hot and make your egg now on that subject mcdonald's keeps it very uncomplicated and boring so we'll do that but you know minus the boring so in a medium-sized bowl add eight whole eggs a splash of heavy cream whisk it together until thoroughly combined then whisk in salt and pepper to taste and before any of the internet elite try to hop on this and say oh you can't salt your eggs now josh what do you know brother shut the hell up now he did non-stick 12-inch skillet over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons or 28 grams of unsalted butter to the pan once melted and bubbling adding just enough egg to coat the bottom of the pan should be about a quarter of your eggs let that egg start to set dragging any cooked egg gently back to the center and allowing the uncooked stuff to hit the hot pan once that egg is about 90 of the way cooked but has just a little bit of moisture on the surface cut the heat fold the egg towards the center in quarters until you get a beautifully square roughly the size of your biscuit that's it place it to the side and repeat with the rest of your eggs wow look it didn't go watery because we nearly fully cooked the eggs now to make your sandwich get yourself one of your biscuits either tear it or slice it in half place a pad of salted butter in betwixt both halves repeat with however many sandwiches you're making wrap them lightly in foil and place in a warm oven around 250 fahrenheit for 10 minutes or so just hot and melted pull her out and assemble sauce is the alpha and omega of any sandwich and mcdonald's dry ass biscuit could use it so you can either make a sauce or just add a touch of mayo to your buttered biscuit then add a layer of sliced cheddar cheese melt that with a torch or broiler then a slice of monterey jack also melted you're beautifully juicy sausage patty and finally your folded buttery egg square thing grab the lid to your treasure chest and crown your beautiful breakfast king judging by the looks of this as per usual the other version looks like a tragedy next to mine but who knows let's give this a taste test and see where we land one of them smells like a foot which one is it the one from mcdonald's i don't care if you can go and get it in five minutes for two dollars that's not the point we can't just accept this as the alpha and omega breakfast sandwiches all right let's taste test this this is a symphony of what a sausage breakfast sandwich should be and should have been the biscuit is flaky buttery delicate melts in your mouth sausage perfectly salted the umami is there the herbaceousness the fresh herbs this all comes together to me to be a much better biscuit breakfast sandwich all right pano you're way away way far away let's see if it holds up there you go so that's number one numero dos yeah that one was a lot less tasty the number one it like took me down to a country road good soup thank you pono we have today's winner good soup isn't this so much better if you don't want to make it yourself and you want to drive down for two dollars i don't care you want to know what else has my biscuit buttered b-roll [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] all right guys and that is it so we made our sausage biscuit with egg and cheese which i think would make a lot more sense if it was the sausage egg and cheese biscuit breakfast sandwich okay or you could just call it the sausage egg and cheese biscuit see isn't that does that roll off the tongue yes i would like to order a sausage egg and cheese biscuit thank you so much now let's try it the other way oh hi can i get a sausage biscuit if you ever say the words with egg you need to turn 360 degrees and walk out the door i don't have anything extra to say about this the visuals told the story so with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a

about this recipe paella like i said it's a beautiful vehicle that can go any direction you want what i would recommend is that you first start with this recipe play around with it and realize how many different directions you can take it's unlimited so with all that being said let's make this shall we paella can be very versatile so consider this your gateway into the world of big round rice plates that can feed a whole got-dang village plus it's basically a one-pot meal before we start we need a shrimp stock thankfully this recipe uses one pound or 450 grams of shrimp that's been peeled and deveined but please get shrimp with the peels on so you can peel them yourself and then reserve all of those shells place them in a medium-sized sauce pot along with one rough chopped onion and four to five bay leaves cover that with four and a half cups or one liter of water place on the stove and bring to a boil over medium-high heat and then immediately reduce the temperature to medium-low and simmer that for to 20 minutes or until flavored to your liking strain it through fine mesh sieve and you have a beautiful shrimp stock now the rest of this is actually fairly quick and easy and done in a single pan did somebody see one pot meal oh my god somebody call them moms you're gonna need a 15-inch paella pan or saute pan i'm a big fan of this one so the link for that will be in the description before you start prepare your lobbies by taking two lobster tails cutting along the center top of the lobster then cutting each of the ribbings on the underside in the same path as the top gently split the top open so it exposes the meat remove the vein that runs along the center if it's still there then take your knife slice straight down the middle and press aggressively on the back of your knife to split the lobster cleanly in half now please when you're doing this keep your fingers free from the blade alright that seems basic but it's just a reminder safety first for the love of your fingies now just repeat with the other tail now in a separate pot grease with spray oil and add half a pound or 227 grams of boneless skinless chicken thighs cut into half-inch cubes steer those for about three minutes tossing occasionally until you get some nice color no need to cook it all the way through at this stage remove all of your chicken and add a mixture of two and a half cups or 600 milliliters of chicken stock and three cups or 700 milliliters of shrimp stock heat to medium high till comes to a boil and turn it to low and then just add about one teaspoon or just under a gram of saffron threads lightly crushed keep it on low heat so it's hot i guess it's sort of a two-part meal at this point now it is time paella has some rules so listen carefully one you must use bomba or some other spanish short grain rice but i'm using bomba here two this is the polar opposite of most ways we cook rice and is done with no lid or washing and in an open pan i know i know seems wrong this is how it's done and three do not stir what do you make in risotto relax now in a 15 inch paella pan or saute pan heat 2 tablespoons or 23 grams of extra virgin olive oil over medium heat once it begins to shimmer add 5 ounces or 140 grams of finely cube spanish chorizo that's spanish chorizo spanish chorizo is not the same as mexican chorizo now cook that stirring occasionally for one to two minutes or until the chorizo begins to get a little crispy and is rendered most of its fat and next you'll add your sofrito consisting of a mixture of one yellow onion very finely chopped one red bell pepper also finely chopped and five cloves of garlic finely chopped all tossed together and then placed into your pan season that generously with salt and pepper and saute for three to four minutes or until softened then add one cup or 245 grams of canned diced tomatoes and one bay leaf and two and a half teaspoons or seven grams of smoked paprika season a taste of salt and cook that down stirring often until most of the liquid is gone about three minutes then add one cup or 240 milliliters of dry white wine again let that simmer down until the majority of your wine has been reduced out about five to eight minutes now finally add your chicken back stir together until the chicken is hot then add three cups or 570 grams of bomba rice stir together allowing the rice to toast for about one minute then slowly pour in your hot saffron broth all evenly around your paella pan gently shake the pan to even out the rice let that come to a simmer over medium-low and cook uncovered for 15 minutes now if a lot of the liquid is evaporated and it's not really starting to soften yet then you can add another cup or so of water around the pan and simmer for a grand total of 15 to 18 minutes another thing that makes paella special is this moment add in your seafood first this begins with your split lobster tail arranging them in a pattern like this and nestling them into your rice flush side down then nestle your shrimps nicely all around the rice and finally nestle in one pound of cleaned little neck clams i do actually like to stand my shrimp up like this yes they look like they're dancing oh haha but also makes them cook more evenly sipping that for another five to eight more minutes and once it looks like there isn't any more liquid bubbling and it starts to smell a little toasted on the bottom of the pan that's great to finish this you'll cut the heat and immediately cover it tightly with foil to steam cook this for another 10 to 12 more minutes now if for some reason the lobster still hasn't finished cooking you can always keep the foil on and pop it in a 350 oven for about five to eight more minutes and that should do it then just pull out your beautiful shimmering pan looking like a swirling vortex into an oceanic world immediately hit that with some high quality extra virgin olive oil ideally spanish which would make sense here scatter around some lemon cheeks just barely cut on the outside of the core of a lemon to avoid the seeds to get a pure juicy flesh finish that with some fresh flat leaf parsley you know making a little garden with happy thoughts and right there is a stunning centerpiece to your table kiss two horses on their ears and call back home but wait before we get too happy about this the bottom of the paella is just as important as the top if you did this correctly then the underside of the piyo will be heavily caramelized and chock full of crispy rice this is called sokarat and hopefully the spanish homies will give papa a little kiss for this one now let's see if this party of a rice dish reigns supreme over the world of rice recipes good lord traditionally would be served right in front of you you got your little bowl or plate get yourself some stuff boop bop and you just keep going but let me just point something out we secured the soaker up sakura i'm not the greatest with the pronunciation thing but i got the crisp that's all i got to say so you can't say that this isn't paella good god so first it's almost like a sandwich you have two layers caramelized rice at the top soft pillowy rice in the middle and crisp rice at the bottom you can taste the fragrance of the saffron and then of course perfectly cooked seafood and if that is not enough for you hit it with a little bit of lemon to freshen it yeah there's a lot of ingredients yeah it takes a little bit of time but everything is done in one pan this is unintentionally a one pot meal but what more could you possibly want that's what it is you wanna know what else has a big shining bountiful platter full of everything that the ocean has to offer b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it just a quick massive thank you to our sponsor for the day trade coffee we appreciate you we love you don't forget to click that link in the description to get your first three bags 20 off and enjoy your perfectly matched cup of coffee it's a great time to be drinking coffee so paella that is one hell of a plate of food the beauty of this dish isn't just the variety i know that's was my whole selling point before but what i personally like about it is it looks so beautiful when presented on the table in front of your guests or you got friends and family or maybe it's just you and a loved one or maybe you're by yourself which is even better because then you can just eat straight out of the plate it's actually quite simple to prepare but it looks so stunning once it's done you don't care about that well then i can't help you i don't know what to say that's the whole purpose of the dish you don't want to make it i'm not going to try and force you to make it i've never cared about that in the first place so with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or learned something leave a like subscribe get your coffee get your paella on and i will see you next time [Music] you

since popeye's did it then kfc is like we could do one we wear chicken place there's a little bit of a niche group of people that think that wendy's is just the ultimatum of chicken sandwiches and i think that that sandwich alone is single-handedly one of the farthest away but i haven't had one in a long time and so we'll pull all this together make the greatest version of all time and step out in style so with all that being said let's make this shall we what happened to the sign jesus can wendy's just live in peace good god wendy quality is our president there's something going on with

sandwich completely normally [Music] oh it's really hot out of the chicken sandwiches we've had on this channel including the popeyes this is one of the better ones but it's also extraordinarily basic the flavor falls completely flat it's just like oh here's a little bit of spice and crunch and a little bit salty and then the rest is just lettuce a chicken sandwich is one of my favorite foods on the entire planet and if it is not a special experience leaving you thinking longing for that sandwich again then you've gone done made a mistake so let's do this right oh look it naturally wanted to go to the trash can you already know we got the bun game on lockdown there is no comparison these are the same buttons from the burger king whopper video but we'll give you a quick walkthrough first off it's the perfect bun recipe for my nine times new york times bestselling cookbook link in the description but because i'm such a sweet sweet man we'll show you the recipe here wow so polite to me so we slightly adjusted the recipe though first off no tangs on started with half a cup or 125 milliliters of whole milk and a half cup plus three tablespoons or a grand total of 170 milliliters of water and to that you'll have two and a half teaspoons or nine grams of bread machine yeast specifically it has as we've stated many times with still dissolved then whisk in one egg plus one egg yolk until homogeneous pop that into the bottom of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook then in a separate bowl combine three and a half cups or 525 grams of bread flour a third cup for 60 grams of granulated sugar 1.5 teaspoons or 11 grams of fine sea salt and 4 grams of amylase enzyme amylase is another conditioner but optional the link is in the description it together until combined then with your stand mixer running on medium-low add your flour mix about a quarter cup at a time until all the flour has been added knead for three minutes then add a quarter cup or 55 grams of unsalted chopped butter let that mix until incorporated scraping the sides as needed and then knead for two to four minutes or until you get a smooth luscious dough give it a little spank grease the medium sized bowl roll your dough into a light ball and place into your bowl cover with plastic wrap with the name you'd give to your own child and rise for one hour or until doubled and now your dough is full of life now punch all of that out separate your dough into nine evenly sized pieces weighing about 90 grams each roll those pieces of dough into top balls and place those balls on a parchment-lined baking sheet in the center of metal four-inch ring molds now i didn't have enough ring molds and so i made them out of foil big whoop see you can always be crafty instead of complaining so many prefer to complain why anyway be sure those molds are greased press them with a flat bottom cup to get a disc cover with greased plastic wrap and allow this to proof for one hour or until puffed filled out and lovely brush or spray the tops with egg wash consisting of one whole beaten egg with a splash of and pop that into an oven that's been preheated to 375 fahrenheit for about 15 minutes or until you pull out some got dang plump bores out of the oven bun's so nice you gotta say it twice now optionally brush those buns with melted butter immediately and then remove them from their molds and let it cool to room temperature okay buns are done let's get our acoutremo prepared before we get to our chicken first a tomb or tome inspired mayo first in a small pan add 15 cloves of garlic to that you'll add one cup or 240 milliliters of vegetable oil so that on the stove over medium heat and allow to come up to a light fry and let it cook stirring occasionally for about five minutes and once your garlic is super soft in a beautiful deep golden brown cut the heat and allow to sit for 5 more minutes then straighten the garlic out and let your oil cool the room temp and trust me on this it needs to be room temp once that's cooled in a blender combine 1 tablespoon or 15 grams of dijon mustard 2 teaspoons or seven grams of granulated sugar your confit garlic one egg yolk one tablespoon or 14 grams of white distilled vinegar blend on high speed until you get a paste and then slowly stream in your cooled oil because you cooled it right if you don't cool the oil it'll break your emulsion so you're blending and slowly streaming until you have a beautifully thick glossy mayo taste and adjust salt levels and pass that through a five mesh sieve and that's your mayo not just any mayo but one of the most incredible garlic sauces of all time now of course for tomatoes slice them to your desired thickness and always lightly salt your tomatoes it is not a question it is simply what you do and for the lettuce i simply just break off some whole leaves from a head of butter lettuce well that's all you need for your toppers oh wow look at the glock it's chicken time what a coincidence in medium-sized bowl add 2 cups or 475 milliliters of buttermilk half a teaspoon or 1 gram of onion powder 1 tbsp or 11 grams of garlic powder 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of kosher salt 1 teaspoon or 5 grams of sugar 1 tbsp or 7 grams of paprika and one and a half teaspoons or four grams of cayenne powder whisk until thoroughly combined and then lay in one and a half pounds or 680 grams of boneless skinless chicken thighs cover and marinate for at least 20 minutes in the fridge and up to overnight if i'm being honest i let them marinate for i think two minutes so real nice now for your dredge combine two cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour six teaspoons or six grams of paprika half a teaspoon or about half a gram of cayenne powder two teaspoons or eight grams of garlic powder one and a half teaspoons or seven grams of kosher salt in one tablespoon or five grams of nutritional yeast whiskey business and you've seen us fried chicken so many times it's the easiest process in the world you got your vegetable oil for frying about two inches worth of oil and the temperature sitting around 350 fahrenheit take your marinated chicken let the excess soak drip off them thighs toss in the dredge pressing it aggressively into the flesh to maintain the no bald spots on your chicken rule place out a sheet tray repeat with the rest of your chicken and once your chicken is breaded gently lay in half of all of your chicken thighs in the oil and fry for three to four minutes or until you pull out that golden brown crispy yum yum place in a wire rack to drain and fry the rest of your chicken now while that second batch is frying this is the secret to my spicy chicken sandwich and that's with a little nashville flavor in a medium heat proof bowl add 1 tablespoon or 10 grams of light brown sugar 1 teaspoon or 4 grams of kosher salt 1 tablespoon or 10 grams of garlic powder 1 tbsp or 10 grams of smoked paprika 2 and a half tablespoons or 13 grams of cayenne powder yes it's a lot you can scale it back if you're sensitive to spicy but we're making this sandwich hot in a beautiful way mix until combined and this is the secret ladle in one and a half cups or 360 milliliters of your hot frying oil yes the oil while you're frying chicken that oil whisk together and toss your chicken in it while the chicken is still blazing hot and so is your spicy oil base that bad boy for a couple of seconds and place back on the wire rack to drain rinse and repeat with all of your freshly fried chicken and this is the most addicting spicy chicken that money can possibly buy now the time for assembly has come first slice and toast your buns in butter until golden and beautiful always mandatory we should know that next heavily confit garlic mayo your bottom bun lay it top your spice glossy chicken a nice little leafed lettuce a fat tomato slice or thin sauce the top bun get a chair ready so you can fall into it and crown your magnificent spicy sandwich king you all know how i feel about chicken sandwiches they're important to me and this chicken sandwich smells so good looks so god dang beautiful i can't help myself but call my dear aunt sally tell her of the tales of chicken that caused anybody to bust tuck your napkin in your shirt and let's give this the proper taste test to decide a final winner this is what a chicken sandwich should look like not this oh oh yeah cheese juice when i was finishing cooking this put a little too much salt but all the other elements the lettuce the tomato that's citrusy garlicky mayo and it has that sort of nashville fried chicken quality to it it's smoky it's spicy it's in your face it's snappy and don't even get me started on that soft bread all right brother he gets someone up here to taste testing oh my god what's your favorite color uh red and a half number one number two yeah yeah no i'm trying to make a point number one i really liked it i don't think the salt issue was that bad the chicken is spicier i'm not getting any spice out of this one the sauce is so good yeah thanks vikram bye all you can really taste in this is lettuce it feels very single noted this is like a symphony there's layers to this that's what butt better's all about brother and it's also actually spicy which you know maybe that's a notation you might want to pay attention if you're making a spicy chicken sandwich so homemade or not understand what you're walking into when you're eating a spicy chicken sandwich and respect yourself and also have a very good time because eating a chicken

Get My Cookbook: http://bit.ly/JWCookbo...",2022-11-25 21:59:44.386764, so much doesn't get the respect that it deserves so obviously we're gonna make the greatest version but with two extremely different price points [Music] right so as i said the french dip it doesn't get a lot of love but it is such a good sandwich roast beef sometimes onions and cheese stacked up tall dipped in some umami rich deeply flavored broth are you kidding me how do i not hear people saying that's my favorite sandwich so we're making the best ultra traditional version but then you know what why not let's make a second one that is as expensive as we can make it and see if that really makes a difference with all that being said let's make this shall we we've got two beautiful and dipping mandatory sandwiches here a more traditionalist meat cheese bun dip for sort of a common price region around 10 20 bucks a sandwich and then we have our 400 sandwich a5 wagyu squillium iii big boy fancy pants version does this massive increase in expenditure equal a better french dip or will the humble beginnings version reign as champion to begin we'll start with our bread which is consistent in both sandwiches sure it's called a french dip and it typically uses a baguette but guess what french dip is american so that means i can do whatever the hell i want so homemade shabbat it is and yes this one is in grams so if you're gonna do this please do it right and don't be oh shut up begin with 220 grams of lukewarm water around 90 degrees fahrenheit and whisk in a heaping quarter teaspoon which is just under one gram of instant yeast once dissolved pour that into 220 grams of bread flour mix together by hand until you have a smooth and very runny paste cover that with plastic wrap and let it rest at room temp for 12 to 18 hours that's uh overnight this is called a poolish hence the regal name i've given it it's a pre-ferment and no you shan't skip it it's the next day and whisk together 375 grams of bread flour and 12 grams of fine sea salt until combined separately dissolve half a teaspoon or 1 gram of instant yeast in 257 grams of water around 90 degrees fahrenheit add your flour mixture to your stand mixer and begin mixing on medium low speed add your yeasty water followed by your poolish then just let that bad boy mix for about 7 minutes scraping the sides as necessary until it's roughly smooth first thing i want to note is that this dough will be very loose and very sticky so stay calm the main thing you're looking for is smoothness and tension it will get smoother and more like a dough as it rests now place it in a greased bowl cover with plastic wrap and do the following allow it to rest and rise at room temp for one hour and then you're gonna perform what's called a turn of the dough turn one with damp hands pick up an edge of the dough near the bowl let it stretch as much as you can without tearing fold it over itself and repeat that stretch and fold all the way around the perimeter of the dough cover it and let it rest for 25 minutes turn number two do the same thing fold and stretch the dough as such all the way around and rest another 25 minutes turn number three being a little more gentle moving forward stretch and fold after that rest for 45 minutes and you have a total of three turns generously flour a work surface scrape your dough out of your bowl using a plastic dough scraper being careful not to degas your dough too much you should have a nice jiggly and taut dough generously flour the top of your dough and very very gently maneuver the dough into a rough rectangle without squishing it using your bench scraper swiftly cut your dough into three long rectangles starting at the longest end doing your best to keep them as even as possible place those three rectangles on parchment slightly larger than the size of your loaves and cover those with an overturned container that does not allow the container to touch the dough and let this proof at room temp for one hour now while that's proving add a baking steel or baking stone to the middle of your oven and begin preheating to 475 fahrenheit and at the bottom of the oven place a dry cast iron pan now once that's preheated for the full hour and your dough is proofed it is time spray your loaves with water and baking no more than two loaves at a time slide them into your oven onto your steel like this you see how finesse that [ __ ] immediately spray your oven with water and add one cup of ice to your ripping hot pan place the violently steaming pan back in close the oven and allow it to steam for 15 to 18 minutes then remove your steamer pan and reduce the heat to 375 and bake for five to eight more minutes or until a beautifully puffed and golden brown ciabatta sub sandwich bread emerges repeat that process with the remaining single piece of dough and of course if you want more you can very easily double this recipe but with that being said these are so big that it definitely qualifies as a two person sandwich and all you have to do is let this cool to room temp next we have our broth very simple you'll need two half cups or 600 milliliters of rich beef broth which i actually enriched mine by searing a beef bone that i happen to have don't ask and simmer that into already prepared beef broth to fortify its beefy flavor even more so now we're ready to actually make it in a pot heat two tablespoons of 28 grams of unsalted butter over medium heat till melted in bubbling then add 1 sweet onion cut in half inch thick slices salt to taste and a small pinch of sugar reduce the heat to medium low and saute that stirring often for 20 to 30 minutes you may have to add a little bit of water to loosen if it starts to get too dark of a fond at the bottom of the pan and once you have a beautiful caramelized you're ready to then add your two and a half cups or 600 milliliters of your rich beef stock then you realize your pot is far too large so you transfer it to something maybe a little more reasonable add a couple sprigs of thyme and let that simmer for about 10 minutes then add one and a half tablespoons or 20 grams of worcestershire sauce and a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of sure dashi taste and adjust salt and pepper levels as needed shrink through a fine mesh sieve and you have your dip to your french all right we have our simple sandwich first so let's make this quick look you need two pounds of very thinly sliced beef i don't care what you use use something that you desire i went with a ribeye steak cut very thinly because i happen to have this thick boy rib roast so uh of course and i sliced it ultra ultra thin but you can use any other beef based off your budget and what you wanted to taste like typically you see roast beef here so if you want to use my prime rib recipe you can use that as well that being said once you have your sliced raw beef pet yourself on the back pal because that's all here's how you cook it heat a large pan or a flat top over medium-high heat give it a light greasing with oil i added b-fat that i rendered out from the side of my rib roast trimming then add a handful of sliced onion this is obviously per sandwich so of course you are going to need a whole thinly sliced seasoning with salt and hard sear that onion till you get some light charring and it begins to soften set it to the side and add a third of your beef season that with salt and pepper and let that sear for two minutes or until you get some nice color flip sear another minute and give it some chopping with the spatula to get the meat a touch more fine and you know coax a little more fat rendering out of it once loosey juicy and goosey toss that back together with your oil let it mingle for a few seconds while that's happening slice the ciabatta loaf in half push your beefiness to one side if you have room and toast the bread in the juices and fat of the beef now if you're using a pan you could totally do this separately in a different pan with butter so you know use your intuition here once you've toasted your buns then shape your meat roughly into the dimensions of your bread add two to three slices of swiss cheese to your beef and allow it to melt or you know force it to with a torch hit your toasted buns with mayo layer on your beefy cheesy beauty grab the top bun and crown a fatty juicy glorious king the sandwich may look simple but it is mighty and powerful or so i think so let's give it a taste test and find out now there's a lot of questions you might have one josh this is french dip you put it on ciabatta two this is not roast beef and i would like to address those questions with two things number one shut up number two the french dip is an american invention i can do whatever i want now let's eat this little dunk [Music] this is so good kendra do you want to eat a french dip you dip it and it's a french tip not just a dip oh i'm sorry you laid dip it [Music] this is so good the texture is great this flavor is great the juice you know the juice is leaking if it doesn't make you leak then you done screwed up brother a friendship has always been long forgotten and not given enough respect but we're gonna take it up a notch and see if we spend a little more money would it be any better right on to our fancy boy version before we make our sandwich let's make parmigiano-reggiano twills sounds fancy it's really easy get a baking sheet with a sill pad on it great little mounds consisting of about two tablespoons of finely grated parmigiano-reggiano and pop that into an oven that's been preheated to 400 fahrenheit and baked for about three minutes or until melted and golden then just allow those to cool till crisp and that's your twill we have our bread and our broth already done so let's just focus on the sandwich of course let's begin with our sauce a horseradish truffle mayo mama start with 1 cup 178 grams of mayo a quarter cup or 55 grams of creme fraiche 2 tablespoons or 40 grams of whole grain mustard 2 cloves of garlic fresh grated a heaping tablespoon or 20 grams of fresh grated horseradish and 1 whole ounce or 28 grams of fresh grated black winter truffle which hilariously is actually this entire truffle nice work season that with salt and pepper and mix until thoroughly combined i mean just visually this is a beautiful sandwich sauce which yields the power to belong to any sandwich next gremolata very simple generous handful of fresh parsley finely chopped and two cloves of garlic finely chopped the zest of one lemon and tossed together and you have a fragrant herbaceous trip better than smelling fresh laundry long as you didn't poop in the laundry for your beef you'll need a whole a5 ribeye or strip loin that's about 12 to 14 ounces trim off any excess fat cut it into your desired shape then heat a dry stainless pan over medium high cc or a5 heavily with salt and pepper added to your pan and sear for 2 minutes as we know a5 will render its own fat out which we appreciate flipped to reveal a sear that will surely cause a tier or 2 and possibly a good old-fashioned bus and sear for one to 2 more minutes remove from the pan and rest for 5 minutes then get your sharpest knife slice into quarter inch thick slices that are even i mean for real i'm tired of seeing all your uneven sliced steaks keep it even especially if you're gonna ball out and drop 250 on a steak now on to assembly which is equally as easy as before generously truffle mayo your toasted buns we always toast here layer on some very thinly sliced fresh onion gently and nicely layer on your whole steak dribbly and moist as it is hit it with your gremolata generously gently add on your parmigiano-reggiano twills and finally crown your undeniably luxurious audacious sandwich cut it in half of course on a bias to reveal a cross section that makes me blush just a little and get ready to dip and put something that costs a lot of money gently and lovingly into your mouth now let's see if well that 400 or so dollars was worth it this is an a5 wagyu sandwich with a black truffle mayo honestly everything about this sandwich is righteous it's got the crunch on the outside but the inside just so aerated and soft and beautiful and luscious and the parmesan twill actually comes through you can taste the parmigiano but what i've realized is it's actually this shoe that makes this entire thing it's very different it feels like a more upscale version bye kendrick this is a very good french tip it goes to show that it comes down to the heart of a french dip the jew so is one better than the other i think these are equally as good would i pay this much for this sandwich actually yes i would which makes me feel stupid because i paid that much for that sandwich money doesn't always correlate to a great time the choice is yours take that to heart don't buy stuff to make you happy you want to know what else is full of meat juice and drips b-roll [Music] or guys and that is it so we made our two different french tips they both came out splendid if i do say so myself was one better than the other it's hard to say i feel like i gravitate a little bit towards the more traditional version because it's a little less chaotic but i really enjoyed the eating experience of these two sandwiches almost equally that makes that 400 price point not really worth it at all but and i say this with a heavy big juicy butt the experience of the wagyu version was a little bit more exotic it felt a little bit more fancy but if i enjoyed it the same then probably we're going to want to vote for that traditional sandwich but hey if you got some extra cash you want to throw out a window and give it a little try have a little a5 sandwich knock yourself out because it's going to be delicious either way and that is the beauty of a french dip so with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or you

that is but cheaper [Music] people don't really think of a cinnamon roll something that's commonly expensive right cinnamon rolls are cheap right uh actually wrong you're wrong congratulations let's get a round of applause for being wrong cinnamon rolls are egregiously expensive and they're so simple to make it requires very little effort you have all the ingredients in your picture right now what are you waiting for this is the recipe for you i want to kiss you do you want to kiss me i hope so so let's make this shall we this is going to be a quicker one than usual because it's so god dang easy so start off with one cup or 240 milliliters of whole milk he did 95 degrees fahrenheit whisk in 1 tablespoon of 12 grams of instant yeast and let that sit for a couple of minutes then mix in two whole eggs until homogeneous pour that into your stand mixer and yes you can do this by hand okay in a separate medium bowl add four cups or 600 grams of all-purpose flour three-quarters of a cup or 164 grams of granulated sugar half a teaspoon or five grams of fine sea salt and this is 100 optional but i also added three grams of amylase which again optional but it helps soften the bread up a little bit now with your stain mixer running on medium low add in your flour mixture until all of your flour is added let your stand mixer slap the dough all around that bowl for about three to five minutes or till smooth then add half a cup or 112 grams of unsalted butter then just let that mix until it's incorporated from then into a light bulb pop it into a greased bowl cover with plastic wrap and let it rise for one and a half hours at room temp or until doubled now instead of standing around and staring at a wall we're gonna prep everything for this while your dough rises first the filling in a small bowl come on three quarters of a cup 164 grams of granulated sugar and one and a quarter teaspoon or 10 grams of ground cinnamon whisk until thoroughly combined then in a medium sized bowl add 1 cup of 242 grams of salted softened butter now add your sugar mixture and mix together until you have a smooth homogeneous paste that is your cinnamon sugar filling now for the icing snag yourself yet another bowl and add 4 ounces or 113 grams of cream cheese that's been softened to room temp mix in one cup or 120 grams of powdered sugar and keep mixing until you get a smooth paste then mix in about three tablespoons or 45 grams of whole milk now listen up here pal there's a lot of parameters that affect an icing so you might want to mix that milk in one tablespoon at a time until it reaches the desired consistency it's a goddang science okay once your dough is done and full of joy punch it down then lightly flour a work surface in your dough and you're gonna roll this bad boy way out into a rectangle that's 26 inches long and 14 inches wide spread your cinnamon butter paste to cover every square foot like it's real estate then using measuring tape on the long side of your dough you're going to cut two inch wide strips you should end up with about 12 to 14 strips total now what i want you to do is roll six of those strips nice and tight all the way up to get a beautiful spiral like this rinse or repeat until you get six rolls and this is where the secret comes into making a giant cinnamon roll take one of your rolls and place it at the bottom of another unrolled strip and perform the same rolling technique allowing that strip to wrap around your other bun do that with all of your remaining dough and you should have a nice array of absolutely caked up cinnamon rolls now pop those bad boys onto a sheet tray lined with parchment cover it with either greased plastic wrap or an inverted large container and then wrapped in plastic wrap to make sure there's no air that can get into it and let this proof at room temp for 45 minutes to an hour or until doubled and preheat your oven to 350 fahrenheit and optionally you can spray these with water or heavy cream pop them into a preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown and shonky pull them out let them cool in the tray for about five minutes then drench in your icing i don't want to read any jokes about this in the comments y'all are nasty alright these things look beautiful let's see if these cinnamon rolls match up to any other cinnamon roll despite its unconventional method good luck this is a big cinnamon roll most the time whenever you make cinnamon rolls i feel like they always end up smaller than you expect that's because the majority of cinnamon rolls that you see in a lot of places are gigantic very minimal ingredients super simple stuff you probably already have in your pantry what more do you want look how soft that is i think we need a sound test of this this is a new kind of sound test that is an ooey gooey super soft cinnamon roll it's just as good as any other fancy bakery you would go to in town and for a fraction of the cost listen buddy there's one place i'm gonna take a giant cinnamon roll it's not to my wallet it's to the bedroom you wanna know what else has spirals of big thick sweet gooeyness b-roll [Music] so we made our gigantic cinnamon rolls not quite a butt better but in a way it kind of is feel good about that i feel good about it the whole point of this series is not just to say oh this can be made cheaply by doing this i'm not trying to find some sort of newfangled way that you've never seen it done before granted yes i do mess with the ingredients to create the highest level of flavor for the lowest cost that's the point but the real point is about technique we made a giant cinnamon roll but with a single batch recipe how's that possible you just cut less of them you only cut six of them no it's the rolling technique it's the way that you put it on the tray it's the finesse that is what makes something good it's not about the price these beautiful cinnamon rolls may not cost much but boy howdy they'll kick you right in the pants with flavor so if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see [Music] you

eat 4 000 of them in one sitting what more do you want to know you need this [Music] so today we're making soup dumplings also known as xiaolongbao xiaolongbao wow sounds really close to what i said i hope i think that a lot of people get scared when it comes to making these right if you've had them before you go man how do they get the soup in here what are they ingesting this or something what a crazy sack of juice is this it's simpler than you think it just comes down to technique and understanding what to do i honestly think this is something that anybody can make if you make it for a dinner party people are going to think you're the coolest of all time so with all that being said let's make this shall we not only one of the greatest most mystical foods on the planet but it's actually surprisingly easy to make so let's do it justice i'm gonna break this down into three elements because it's just like any other dumpling there's the filling the dumpling dough and of course the dipping sauce wait josh what about the juicy juicy squirt squirt how in tar nation did they get the soup in there it was actually with chicken or pork stock that's been reduced and chilled into a gel similar to an aspect sorry what yeah it's called an aspect which by the way in most culinary cases sucks anyway solidified broth that then melts when heated see where we're going here right so let's begin with our broth in a medium saucepot add just enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan and heat to medium high once that's add in two to three green onions sliced into one inch pieces see those bad boys tossing occasionally for two to three minutes or until lightly charred remove from the pan and add half a pound or 225 grams of boneless pork boston butt cut into two to three big chunks and let that sear for two to three minutes per side just to get some nice brownie don't worry about cooking it through all right it's gonna cook later remove from the pot and now add one and a half pounds or 680 grams of pork neck bones which have already been rinsed with cold water to remove any impurities then add your roasty toasty meat three quarters of a pound or 454 grams of pork skin cut into manageable pieces now look this stuff is super cheap please do not skip it it helps it beat gelatinous and it helps give almost a creamy tonkotsu style broth almost not exactly and you can find it at most asian markets or just cut it off some pork belly that you bought now follow that with your green onion and a one inch knob of ginger thinly sliced cover that with five cups or a little over one liter of water and look if there's not enough water covering it then you can just add an extra cup just to have it submerged now set that over medium high bring to a boil then immediately reduce to a simmer skim off any scum that rises to the top and reduce for two to two and a half hours or until you're left with just two and a half to three cups of broth then remove all the bones strain everything through a strainer and into a flat container like the shallow third pan season that generously with salt let it cool close to room temp then wrap with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for at least four hours but ideally overnight by the way if you don't do pork or you want a chicken version you can very easily just pop in four chicken carcasses or about four pounds worth into a baking dish along with the same aromatics covered with three quarters of a cup of water tightly covered with foil and roast at 450 for one hour and you'll pull out a very concentrated broth that simply needs straining and chilling i much prefer the pork version and it tastes much more nostalgic to me but i'm just trying to give you options alright so let's pretend it's the next day now before we make our filling you need to realize that you cannot have a dumpy sans dumpy dough no if ands or buds so your wrapper dough needs to be homemade but good news it only requires two ingredients first in a medium sized bowl add one and a quarter cup or 170 grams of all-purpose flour yes this one is grams because the hydration percentage makes a big difference anyway begin stirring that with a fork while constantly stirring in three and a half tablespoons or 50 grams of hot water i want it scalded brother stir until all the water is absorbed by the flour and then stir in three tablespoons or 40 grams of just room temperature water once it begins to form a dough start kneading by hand and to be honest with you i'm not sure if it's too hot or not on account of my asbestos restaurant hands but if it's unmanageable you know maybe put on some gloves or something i don't know anyway knead that for five to eight minutes or until you get a beautifully smooth dough like this wrap that in plastic wrap and rest at room temperature for 45 minutes now while that's resting let's make our filling in a medium-sized bowl add one pound or 450 grams of ground pork with a high fat percentage that lean ground pork ain't gonna cut it i ground my own because much of what was at the market was too lean and i was frustrated so i just ground some boston butt roast with a few pieces of pork fat back added just for a little bit extra fatty but if you're buying it at the store please look for pork that's around 70 lean to match that knead your ground pork till nice and emulsified and to that you'll add three green onions very finely minced a pinch of ground white pepper half a teaspoon or two grams of granulated sugar half a teaspoon or two grams of salt two tablespoons or 30 grams of soy sauce one and a half tablespoons or 22 grams of schausing wine half a teaspoon or three grams of toasted sesame oil give it a little pat for being so good and knead it together until thoroughly combined in homogeneous now this is where our broth gel comes into play once it's fully chilled scrape off any solidified fat off the top and then using a spatula separate it from the sides of your container and pop it out onto a cutting board and cut that broth sheet into half inch cubes being gentle and careful not to break them into little pieces you want them to look like little umami diamonds ooh mommy gather about one cup or 235 grams of that broth gel add it to your pork mixture and gently fold that together until evenly incorporated look it's okay if it breaks into little pieces at this stage but you definitely want nice generous handfuls of broth dispersed it's a beautiful sight okay it's shaping time this is the only part that's gonna be a bit of a challenge for people who've never done it but hey this is where you get good now separate the rest of dumpling dough into two pieces roll those out into long rods about one inch thick cut off segments weighing 10 to 15 grams each that's 20 to 25 jumpers y'all take one of your balls and dusting with flour as needed roll it into a beautifully round disc that's about three and a half inches in diameter then grab a heaping tablespoon of filling add it to the center of the disc and look if you've never done this please be patient don't expect it to be perfect on your first try if you've pleated regular gyoza dumplings then this should be pretty familiar all you're gonna do is cup your dough grab a piece of that carefully fold it over itself to create a little well pleat stick that fold onto itself and then repeat each little pleat one next to the other as close to the previous plate until you've made your way all the way around the whole dumpling and it's mostly closed up you know that you've done it right when you're left with sort of a hole at the top keep your mind out of the gutter gently pinch and twist your hole shut and that is a got dang soup dumpling if i ever seen one again this takes practice so repeat this process with all of your pieces of dough each dumpling you do will be better than the last it's about the new things that come along that you have no experience with and whether you like it or not you learn how to utilize it yeah that's what uh dumplings are gonna teach you now the dumplings are done and you're ready to cook them all you need to do is cut out little squares of parchment about four by four inches place your dumplings on each piece of parchment individually and you're ready to steam add a shallow one and a half inch depth of water in a pot bring that to a boil over medium-high then reduce the temp to medium load up a bamboo steamer with as many dumplings as you can leaving at least half an inch of space in between them please do not overcrowd this bad boy now pop the lid on and place your basket on your steaming pot and well let it steam for eight minutes you could twiddle your thumbs while that steams or you could make the perfect dipping sauce which consists of 2 tablespoons or 17 grams of spicy chili crisp solids in a third cup or 88 grams of chinese black vinegar yep that's it you could also add a splash of red vinegar to this if you're feeling a little bit naughty now serving this is very simple obviously the dumplings will be presented as is but very important to serve the sauce place it in a nice little ramekin or pinch bowl my mom made this pinch bowl by the way thank you mom to that sauce add a few threads of very finely julienne fresh ginger and you're gonna do that for each individual serving of sauce it's a game changer don't skip now at this point your dumplings are done and all there's left to do is bite a little hole get a little slurp of broth dunk that feller into the sauce and throw what is surely to be one of the best bites of food you'll ever have in the history of your home cooking yes i'm serious now let's taste test this to see what i'm talking about here xlb baby that's my next album xiaolongbao i just busted because these soup dumplings sure do look fine you already saw the b-roll you saw the dribble you saw the drip i mean look at these they look stunning they've got a sheen pick them up mommy right how do you eat a soup dumpling well you take a little bite and then you pour the soup out and at this point you can kind of eat it however you want although the way that i like to do it is give that little opening that hole you now are going to fill with your dipping sauce scoop it up in there now it's refilled you have your soup give the soup a little sip go to another dimension and then combine it all that just sent me to another hemisphere i don't even know what that means i would argue that it is better not just because it tastes better or it has a better texture where i made it with my own two freaking hands but because it has customizability you can do whatever you want with these soup dumplings this is a guide that should direct you and you should march forward on your treacherous path of making the greatest soup dumpling that you'll ever place in your mouth should you want to put anything else in your mouth ever again no this is what goes in your mouth you want to know what else shoots hot juices into your mouth after one bite b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we've made our soup dumpling slash xiaolongbao one thing i want you to realize there are many many many many many ways that you can make this this is just a base level you make it fancier add truffle to it you can put caviar on top if you want to be really fancy it can be made so many different ways but the one thing that doesn't change is that pop of juicy yum yum in the mouth soup dumpling is the alpha and omega of both noodle soups and chewable dumplings it's just the perfect marriage so with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] you

Also, it's my bday today so Uhm... my book is right below.

Get My Cookbook (It's my bday today so you have...",2022-11-25 21:59:44.386764, you know we've made a lot of burgers here wow look at all those and they all kind of come with the same feeling the same bun they hold the same but this isn't just some burger this is the only patty melt you'll ever need [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the new year is here ulysses look at the single one on his head off oh wow so with the new year comes a lot of new things my book is new and also a lot of people like to cook want to start eating healthy or whatever you want to do in the new year this is going to help you wow it was all a plug all along the link is in the description god dang nine times new york times bestseller thanks to you if you don't have it yet what the are you doing i missed all of that so we're making the whataburger patty melt the patty melt is the one item from whataburger that i will eat and not actually hate it's nice you got these big thick pieces of texas toast a ton of melted cheese burger the fact that you hold it sort of like a deli sandwich as opposed to like a burger that's round it just eats super differently which they say the texture doesn't change flavor brother it came i can't continue without pointing out that i do still think whataburger is slightly overrated it is what it is but to me a patty melt should be so good that beckons the thought of it every single day after eating it for a full month and this is gonna do that so with all that being said let's make this shall we wow we're at whataburger so good i've never once in my entire life gone to this place eating a burger and went what a burger nobody says that i do like their branding it's very quaint it's cute as we all know this is but better we are back at the three-point system first the building itself out of all the fast food places i would say whataburger does pay good attention with their design and it's very brand consistent so i'll give it a 69 out of 115. that's pretty good that's high praise next part of the three-point system is the menu the menu is better than most fast food menus only because they have a couple of texasy things i'll give it a 5.932 out of 9.8 again high praise one of our highest praised restaurants so far can i just do two whataburger patty melts just a sandwich okay awesome perfect 1427 thank you awesome thank you you're welcome they're kind of killing it right now because she was very nice and i felt very intended to service is going to get a 10 under 10. i said whataburger you're doing pretty good right now thank you so much appreciate it so the service was a bit slow it's fine they're rushing like crazy but they're not that busy i guess it's just this never been frozen beef let's baka our way back home and see how whataburger fares so we've got the bag first off design very nice i like it this looks like a school lunch this looks nothing like the photo you want that smell wise this is one of the better things i've smelled on this channel i know a lot of people like josh you're so mean there's no way it smells like farts when i say it smells like farts it smells like farts i know a fart when i smell it despite how much sauce is actually on here i cannot taste it um and there's no salt at all like almost none all things considered do i hate this burger no it's actually one of the better burgers we've had on this channel but it's also extraordinarily boring considering what it could be so let's take it there shall we right uh no buns that's hip you know what respectable and not a problem but if we're using texas toast instead of buns are we gonna use pre-sliced bread if you want a basic ass sandwich then yeah but if you want full control of your life and slice thickness and maximize customizable flavor then you make it yourself it's really easy first snag yourself one and a quarter cup or 290 milliliters of water around 95 degrees fahrenheit and mix in one tablespoon or 12 grams of bread machine yeast we're using that yeast specifically instead of instant because bread machine east usually has in it which work better for this type of bread in a separate bowl containing four cups or 600 grams of all-purpose flour add in three tablespoons or 47 grams of granulated sugar 2 teaspoons or 12 grams of fine sea salt and 1 teaspoon or 3 grams of amylase wow time for a funny little man lesson amylase is a naturally occurring enzyme that catalyzes hydrolysis of starch confused let me make this simple this is optional but it helps soften the bread even further borderline to commercialized softness and you can get it online link in the description anyway whisk it together until combined add in one whole egg to your yeast juice with still combined then pour that into the bowl of a stand mixer fit that with the spiral attachment begin mixing on medium low speed and add your flour mixture a quarter cup at a time until all of your flour has been added let that mix for two to three minutes or until you get a slightly smooth dough then add a quarter cup or 56 grams of unsalted softened butter please stop trying to use cold butter all right you will regret it and then you're gonna complain to me and then i'm gonna be like oh my god i literally told you not to do that why are you doing that now let that mix for about five minutes on medium speed until all the butter is added and incorporated and you should have a smooth beautiful dough shape that into a light ball place into a grease bowl cover with plastic wrap make it respectable of course and let it rise at room temp for one to one and a half hours or till doubled and chunky now punch your dough down till all the yeast is released gently turn it on to a lightly floured work surface and roll into a rectangle that's the same length wide as the bread pan you're using ah right speaking of bread pan you need one that's sized for one and a half to two pound loaf you go too small and uh well i think you could do the math there anyway once that's rolled out it is about a half inch thick starting from the bottom closest to you roll that bad boy all the way up nice and tight seal the bottom and pop it into a bread pan that's been greased lightly tent it with greased plastic wrap and let it rise for about 45 minutes at room temp by the way this would be a great time to pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit you're welcome all right no need to thank me there now once it's risen and about three quarters of an inch above the top of the pan wow look at our little mane gently peel off the plastic wrap lightly spritz your loaf with water using a spray bottle and pop it into your preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes or until you pull out a beautiful golden brown rotund loaf of bread i mean look at this stunning big boy pop it out of your pan gently and let it cool in a wire rack on its side we do this because it makes the little man look funny haha and to keep the top nice and smooth and rounded if you let it cool the other way then it kind of gets a little crinkly and weird and cool to room temp and that is your bread look i'll admit this loaf ended up a tad taller than i wanted it to which visually looks dope but functionality wise for this it was a bit difficult so i'd recommend picking a loaf pan that's a little wider rather than taller but hey we're working with ground beef so you could always form it to whatever you want right so while that's cooling let's make our creamy pepper this sauce is a decent volume of ingredients so um in a medium size bowl add one and a quarter cup or 200 grams of mayonnaise one teaspoon or two grams of sweet paprika one teaspoon or three grams of brown white pepper a mixture of one tablespoon or four grams of black peppercorns and half a teaspoon or half a gram of green peppercorn which have been ground coarse add that in followed by three cloves of garlic grated half a cup or 110 grams of ketchup one tablespoon or 12 grams of please prepare the trumpets worcestershire sauce pretty good pronunciation there for me salted taste and albeit optional and look we rarely do this here add half an ounce or 14 grams of fresh grated black winter truffle you know i'm gonna get trashed you can't do that that's too much of a flex it's making it too shut up i promise if you remove this ingredient it would still be better now mix it together to incorporate and finally add a third cup or 25 grams of grated parmigiano reggiano all right that's the last ingredient i swear now mix that together until thoroughly combined and let me tell you something this is probably one of the best burger sauces we've ever released period i don't care if you're oh josh that has so many ingredients you use truffle and you hush hush your little mouth this sauce is special right so we're almost ready instead of grilling our onions i decided to shoe string fry them we've done enough griddled onions for burgers here but if you do really want it to be griddled then you can use the one from my in and out video anyway snag yourself one yellow onion and slice it into quarter inch thick rings on a mandolin place them in a bowl and cover them with one cup or 216 grams of buttermilk season that mixture with salt then fill a separate bowl with one cup or 150 grams of all-purpose flour then take a handful of buttermilk soaked onions drain the excess and then add them to the flour and toss until completely coated no bald spots then place them on a baking sheet while you coat the rest now once all of your onyo have been dredged heat a pot of oil that's at least one and a half inches deep to 350 degrees fahrenheit gently lay in your onion in batches frying for about one to two minutes or until they are a beautiful dark golden remove them from the oil with a spider and drain them on a wire rack and season immediately with salt while they're hot a so the salt sticks and b so you can receive a kiss from papa and good look at these you know you could totally just dip these in the sauce if you're feeling a little naughty alright it's time slice your bread a little over half an inch thick toasted in butter on both sides till the surface is beautifully bronzed like a perfect sunset cut a clove of garlic in half and rub the cut ends on both sides of your toasted bread to perfume with a garlicky kick next you'll need 3 pounds or 900 grams of ground beef and make sure this beef is high fat 80 lean is too lean for this anything below that is gonna be better now form this into a third pound or 150 gram balls which all in all will get you enough for four patty melts total now get yourself a cast iron skillet set over medium-high heat until it's as hot as the large hadron collider maybe it's a little too hot you get the point give it a light spray with non-stick cooking spray add in a ball and immediately press with a spatula or a burger press like this season a taste with salt and pepper let that sear for one to two minutes or until beautifully brown flip and season the other side with salt and pepper and sear for another one minute then add one slice of monterey jack cheese let it melt or force it to melt because you don't want to wait place it to the side and repeat with all of your patties i will say that i prefer to melt the bottom patty's cheese after i lay down the sandwich just so the cheese is ultra bubbly and hot but that's optional anyway now the moment of truth assembly time texas toast on the board generously sauce with your pepper mayo first patty down followed by monterey jack melt that bad boy next patty which already has cheese on it sauce your other toast generously and finally but most importantly give it a fat stack of your luxurious fried onions grab that other toasty boy give it a little chef's kiss call somebody you love and tell them about this sandwich and crown your magnificent king and that is our patty melt and you know what out of all the patty melts that i've ever seen and eaten something just looks so righteous about this one you give it one good look and say yeah you know what all is okay in the world in this moment now let's taste test these and see who the real winner is and uh you know what whataburger also dm to me and said to not do it to them but you know here we are so sorry about that wow we've arrived we didn't really get to get not one green in this at all all meat and beef oh i'm not saying it's unfair that we have the onion rings but it doesn't matter because the sandwich is astronomically better everything in here is exactly what i want the bread is actually good it's soft it's almost like a nice brioche the beef perfectly cooked it's juicy it's salted beautifully but we need someone to make the final determination so we'll have our friend yuma joining us today ready yes sorry are you ready i'm gonna need to go a little bit more honey whoa so that's number one number two oh my god your tongue is vibrating dry number one very rich juicy and this one just tastes like an old sandwich look man if you're hitting a piece of bread and it makes that noise you've already lost so long story short we won the patty melt has been done did you decide if you want to make it or not or if you're going to go through the drive through and enjoy your cafeteria you wanna know what else has meat covered in papa's creamy yum yum truffle sauce b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our patty melt it was fat it was tall it was beautifully built oozing cheese are you tired of having the same style of burger well enter the paddy mill welcome to happy brother the main thing that we learned today is that a patty melt could be much much better so with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music]

KitchenAid Pasta Attachment: https://www.amazon.com/3...",2022-11-25 21:59:44.386764, so my girlfriend spends no time in the kitchen and the last time we challenged her she actually did surprisingly well but this time [Music] i think you've all seen kate by now all right my social media everything instagram blah blah if you don't follow me on there link in the description for that as well as our prior challenge here it is wow that was crazy can we get d uh d for dubs w for dubs in the chat f's in the chat is bad no they're all gonna put here's what we're gonna do to turn it up a notch you're gonna cook one of my most challenging recipes for a beginner it's not my most challenging because if it was most challenging would take like probably a week and it's gonna be coming from the book you're gonna be making fresh pasta from scratch oh no and then you're gonna make the accommodating sauce you have one and a half hours grand total including dough rest time fairly simple recipe that i think most seasoned cooks can make quite simply but as a beginner someone who may not have the touch i mean how do you think you're going to do this is too much 10 hard 10 being like like i'm probably gonna have a breakdown in the middle of making this recipe yes okay well then you would be happy to hear that we have three saving graces for you during this process number one you can stop the timer for 10 minutes maximum only one time number two i can help you for one minute and 30 seconds as many times as you want but but if you want my help you must subtract five minutes from the timer make it two minutes subtract five everybody who says that that's very fair no one has responded one minute at 50 make it an even one minute and 50 seconds saving grace number three you can look at one video during this time of mine to visualize and see how it should be done you don't want to ask for my help for one of the moments look it up on my youtube channel let's everyone wish kate a good luck i'll be right here pray to god ramsay i think you're going to be able to do this so kate can do it anyone can do it there is a win-loss situation should you win then i will cook you a dish of your choosing and my guess is it's gonna be lemon chicken i've been begging you to make this for me for five years if you lose you have to hold a raw dead duck like a baby 20 seconds say you love it with all that being said let's make this shall we what do i do is open it boy we already lost on the first step kate are you ready i'm a little nervous yeah answer the question but the timer begins now starting with flour first caitlyn recipe i'm excited three cups of flour that's a cup right one two three form a mound of flour and sprinkle salt over the top so i guess you like kind of do that i have to hurry kicking it with a loaf remember i don't care josh you're stressing me out it will have to rest for 30 minutes okay well i'm trying to make a mound that can hold five eggs that moment when your flower looks like an anise an ant yeah an ant i'll be the dishwasher for the day that's what i'll do make a mound make a well in the middle of the flower mound well thing in here large enough to hold eggs and you can fit five eggs in there do you think i can because it's already happening i honestly don't know i'm scared oh no i don't know if that was a good crack that was a good crack i'm getting very stressed right now ah it's going outside the mouth the scream okay it's okay it's okay is that okay yeah it's okay is it okay yeah do i need to restart you don't have time to restart olive oil over the eggs why would you do that it's okay it's okay i didn't look at the recipe to see how much olive oil i was supposed to put so i just kind of drizzled it in there i like that you're eyeballing something you've never done before banking on the fact that i'm making this with love gently whisking the eggs and oil until mixed together what is in this oh my god the sun's going away ah that's actually correct yeah see how the egg is wrapping around the fork i'm breaking my well though is that okay yeah how long do you do now i don't know i was about to ask you well there's a book right there be careful not to make a path for the eggs to flow out that's not what i would do but that's do that's achieving the same result okay well i'm making a really big mess me when i poop can i have a time check 8 49. does that mean i've been almost 10 minutes okay oh i'm doing great begin using your hands to mix and squeeze until fully combined yep until it comes together if using bold turn okay whatever okay so we're using hands now because i decided that we are this is why i don't like cooking so we're not doing well over here no you're doing great keep kneading it knead it harder so grab it like this peel off hand that's good you're that's exactly how you should do it wow it's almost like my instructions were like really good or something okay you made a dough how does that make you feel should i name it sure what do you want to name it carrie i'm gonna name it poop okay you're gonna have to speed it up i'm trying my best i'm rooting for you i'm your cheerleader right now are you okay oh yeah just singing how does the dough make you feel kate it kind of looks like play-doh i can't argue with that you can always tag me in to finish this all right can you finish it yeah the sun went away good riddance all right i'm going to need this over here you got to throw out what what your measuring cups were were not full enough can we get a replay were they light i like to guesstimate things i'm gonna assume that i'm right like i see josh doing this sometimes so i feel like that's a good technique give it a little slap oh there goes the sun i'm just trying to make sure this doesn't set on fire i need to rest for 25 minutes alexa are you proud of it yeah take a family picture yeah carbonara i just want to put the water in the pot so that i can just like turn it on and there's there's a system i like that okay season very generously with salt to a boil here's my pot i think this is large do you think that's my largest pot i think this is a large pot this is a large pot how many people are we feeding you're doing so great i just wanted to show everybody how big my pot was sprinkle that in there yep that's just all my expensive maldone well it's gonna taste good ah you're stressing me out so cook spaghetti i don't have spaghetti yet pasta is cooking i don't have pasta yet i've tossed it a pan with meat and garlic i don't have that yet add egg yolks i'm making the egg yolk and cheese stuff i'm not gonna say the words out loud because i'm scared and i'm gonna get roasted by the internet add egg yolks cheese together i watched josh do this one time so i think i don't i think yeah but that's like i think i would recommend for me josh i'm speaking oh no people are gonna attack me i'm just kidding i wanted to okay that's good that's what i wanted you to do now let's grab it yeah transfer in between your hands back and forth like that see oh we all learned something today this is a very great technique josh thank you but i like kind of the egg i feel like it's kind of fun no next next thing this is so much fun i think this egg yolk like press it lightly isn't that fun this is i wish we had more eggs i don't know how to entertain the audience okay this is enough because i say it's enough now i'm gonna grab this other cheese okay i think this is half a cup it is actually that's pretty good you think this smells like feet i don't really sniff feet very much combining cheese and egg gifts okay now mix it together with a fork josh if i was in a kitchen would i get fired um it depends on what kitchen i worked at zaxby's on the grilled cheese station i wasn't really good at any of the other stations grilled cheeses only would you be nice to me yes i would be nice to you i am wiping wow look at you go just like farting and she's like wow good job i'm gonna use this because i think it looks pretty unapologetic on it same name as my cookbook the link is in the description four ounces diced into half inch cubes do you want to tap me in for this i can slice this really fast for you no i'm saving you for later this is probably the hardest part this no oh no my point still stands quantity i like isn't cheap kate if we had a dog maybe i could eat it i'm gonna have you do this uh one with 50 starting now okay so that's all cut garlic needs to be sliced rough rough chopping there's really not much else i can do i get you a pan that's not gonna help me reserve this stuff to the side no not the garlic you're sabotaging yourself so far the only real mistake you've made was put the garlic in the pan honestly would say you're doing pretty good so the next thing is to start preparing the pasta i'll be doing on time i'm stressed don't tell me you don't want to know interesting i think i'm supposed to roll it in flour and then make it into spaghetti you're we're actually going to make fettuccine on this one the spaghetti machine is broken i'll set this on your book where's the flower i can't complain about that i did wipe my butt with it we're sprinkling our sun our table oh there's pictures okay where's the little cuddy thing cuddy thing cuddy thing cuddy thing the section two sections four pieces you're like a sim okay i'm gonna help you a little bit there's no way i'm expecting you to do this this doesn't count this is a great attachment i love this thing and that's not sponsored but if you did want to buy one links in the description good lord have mercy a lot of links in the description today let's see if we remember to put it in there this time pono exactly flour both sides and then you're going to flatten it into something that's roughly like that the big one and then it's going to go slower the best advice i can give people that don't know how to cook is find someone that knows how to cook and then can just teach you thank you oh i forgot to put a flour on this dust it on there like that no so now wipe it off wipe it all off that's dusting all right yeah that's that's really good now that now you've got a pasta dough that's actually coming in i see my hand together yeah that's a beautiful pasta right there remember we need tension tension tension i don't think that's tight but it's we're trying are you drinking no you have to meet my boss later i don't know how you're making that work how long this piece of like where's the cutter how long is a piece of fettuccine spaghetti oh no so hold on hold on hold on that's too long girl how long is a piece of fettuccine josh this is my recipe now dust them really generously with flour before you run them through this that's just dust yup yup look at that look at that what's that cake sorry this is pasta let's go she did it yeah so talk about your childhood kate i never made pasta not that way not that way not that way yep that way jesus still worked it's fine i don't know how honestly we are making moves i'm very stressed out you need to cook the guanciale and the garlic and then you're going to turn it off what was i saying right hang on i got you i got you you've got your guanciale in the pan you need to cook this until it's rendered out and crispy and then turn the heat off add the garlic stir and let it sit okay and keep it warm and then you'll boil your pasta how much time do we have left 18 minutes are you kidding me i'm using my 10 minute all right you have 28 minutes left this this recipe takes 15 minutes total so i think you're good stirring occasionally you feel brown and crispy and then i think i put the garlic in it's cooking because there's little bubbles coming out and you can see the heat does

This is a fried chicken breakfast sandwich for champions. Oh, it also has homemade Mcgriddle buns on it. 

Get My Cookbook: http://bit.l...",2022-11-24 21:59:44.386764, we've made a lot of breakfast sandwiches on here what if i took one element from each and combine them to make the greatest breakfast sandwich of all time okay so today we're making amalgamated twisted creation from another land what i'm trying to say is i'm taking multiple elements from different breakfast sandwiches we've made throwing in a fat boar of a perfectly buttermilk fried chicken to see if we can make a breakfast sandwich so got dang good it's a meal on its own you just need the sandwich and nothing else you're good for like seven to eight hours afterwards so with all that being said let's make this shall we what really classifies a breakfast sandwich well let's look at the basic version you got a white loaf of bread toasted egg scrambled little salty salt you know simple bacon cooked to a browned either floppy or crisp exterior place down upon your bread your scrambled eggs some sort of cheese in this case cheddar topped off with another slab of toast and you have a humble slash simple breakfast sandwich nothing wrong with it cheese pull and everything let's do a quick taste test and see how we want to go about this we have a breakfast sandwich oh so cute look there's nothing inherently wrong with this i'm a big fan of this it's simple beauty and simplicity but that's not what today's video is about is it no get out of here this is not supposed to be simple but we're gonna review a simple one this is the one that my mom would usually make for me right everybody's mom has made this sandwich this is just good let's talk about nostalgia for a second think about what that bite tasted like two pieces of toast eggs cheese bacon that's it no sauce no fancy salt just that i did just realize that i forgot black pepper moment of silence for that all right enough silence the assessment is it's a delicious sandwich buttery you got the eggs the cheese all the flavors kind of meld together and you can pick each one out that's why people say that cooking simple food is more difficult because you can tell the inconsistencies immediately it's not covered by anything else it's a good sandwich but i think we could do better so we're going to try making the greatest fried chicken breakfast sandwich and see how it compares to this right so as i said nothing wrong with a beautifully simple breakfast sandwich but you know sometimes that gets boring sometimes you crave an adventure maybe one like this double cheeked up maple griddle cake bunned fried chicken breakfast sandwich so let's break it down first thing maple griddle cake buns yes with literal pockets of maple syrup in the got dang bun if i'm being honest this bun recipe is for my mcgriddle video it is what it is so grab a medium soft spot and add one cup for 240 milliliters of maple syrup bring to a boil over medium-high heat and let it reduce adjusting the temp as needed to avoid it boiling over until the mixture reaches 265 degrees fahrenheit about 10 minutes let the mixture sit until most of the bubbles subside and pour into a parchment-lined baking sheet and allow it to cool completely once it's cooled tear off small pieces of your maple candy and roll into small balls about half the size of a pee repeat until you get about one cup of balls or until you get tired of rolling balls so you can freeze or refrigerate the stuff and use later like in pancakes or biscuits or whatever okay griddle cake buns probably the easiest buns you'll ever see on this channel so pay close attention in a medium-sized bowl combine one and a half cups or 225 grams of all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of granulated sugar 2 teaspoons or 9 grams of baking powder 2 teaspoons or 5 grams of fine sea salt give that a whisk till thoroughly combined mix in one and a half cups or 323 grams of whole milk beat one whole egg till homogeneous then whisk that into your flour mixture there's a lot of uh mixing mixtures here and whisk together just until it comes together in a smooth batter finally mix in two and a half tablespoons or 35 grams of gently melted unsalted butter until completely incorporated please do not over mix this we're making airy light buns not dehydrated biscuits unless you want dehydrated biscuits you know maybe it makes you happy that's what it's all about happiness so to cook these brothers off get yourself a 4-inch middle ring mold grease that failure up heat a flat top or a pan over medium heat lightly butter it by rubbing a pad of butter on it you just want a thin veneer of melted butter not a poaching bath then place your ring mold atop that and fill your ring mold about half an inch up with batter add some of your tiny little balls scattered evenly atop the batter gently press them so that they're submerged and cover with an inverted bowl or i guess maybe a lid if you're using a pan and let that steam cook for one to two minutes remove the bowl and you know it's ready to flip when the ring mold comes off relatively easily then gently flip the cake and look if it farts out the end just a little that's fine just carefully place that ring mold back on top to guillotine off that skirt to keep it even now just let it cook for another two minutes or until nicely brown on the underside and of course the inside is just cooked through place sit on a wire rack to cool and repeat with the rest of your dough in tiny little maple balls you know there's nothing better than some little cakes and little balls hello somebody okay you have your maple griddle cakes next let's talk fried chicken first we need our in a medium-sized bowl add 2 cups or 480 milliliters of buttermilk two teaspoons or six grams of ground white pepper a quarter teaspoon or one gram of onion powder one tablespoon or 14 grams of garlic powder one tablespoon or 10 grams of smoked paprika 1 tablespoon or 10 grams of kosher salt and half a teaspoon or 3 grams of [Music] give that a whisk until thoroughly combined and add in 1 pound or 450 grams of boneless and skinless chicken thighs let them have a little bath in your milkies and ideally marinate in the fridge overnight or use right away because you forgot to now for your flour dredge get a big boy bowl and add 2 cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon or 10 grams of kosher salt a quarter teaspoon or 1 gram of optional msg 2 teaspoons or 5 grams of medium coarse ground black pepper 2 teaspoons or nine grams of garlic powder in a cute little pinch bowl that my mommy made thank you mom one teaspoon or four grams of smoked paprika give that some whiskey business until thoroughly combined and you're ready to fry high into the sky of mountainous flaky buttermilk fried chickeny terrain anyway real simple toss a couple pieces of chicken in your flour and coat thoroughly pressing the flour aggressively into the chicken to ensure that it's completely coated with your dredge with no gap dang bald spots anyway shake off the excess and place it on the sheet tray until all of your chicken is breaded now fried time is simple hot oil 350 degrees fahrenheit and at least two inches deep lay in two to three thighs at a time laying away from you as to avoid being a donkey and splashing yourself with hot oil and fry those brothers for four to six minutes or until they are beautifully crisp golden brown and the internal temp is 165 fahrenheit fish them out with a spider and drain on a wire rack optionally you can season a taste with salt at this point but they shouldn't need it repeat with the rest of your chicken and guess what you've fried all your chicken congratulations what do you want metal now we're almost ready to assemble our sandwich but hold your horses who wants to go around life with no sauce my sauce is a non-renewable resource so please do this accordingly in a small bowl combine one cup or 160 grams of creme fraiche a quarter cup of 40 grams of mayonnaise a small handful of finely chopped parsley and a couple sprigs of fresh thyme leaves also finely chopped last but not least two cloves of garlic grated and season a taste with salt generously stir together until evenly incorporated and that is your sauce now let's cross check our elements here chicken check sauce check buns check oh i forgot about bacon i cooked it on a flat top over medium heat flipping constantly until well uh done to my liking which is brown but still assembly time bottom bun herbed creme fresh spread evenly one slice of cheddar cheese melted lovingly either with a torch or under a broiler bacon to your heart's desire followed by a crisp thigh of chicken a fried egg which is cooked simply in a non-stick pan with three tablespoons of oil over medium high heat your egg cracked in and basted with that hot oil to cook the whites and finally season with flaky salt place gently atop your chicken sauce your top bun and ever so softly as to not bus that which desires to be buzzed lay that bun down and wow i mean look at that this isn't just a breakfast of champions instead in the breakfast world this is the champion now let's bust that yolk ogle at its drip and taste test this to give it our review have you ever seen a got dang breakfast sandwich look like this this is like the mcgriddle sleeper i know we've done the mcbridle but better granted we did use the same buns to be fair but this is part of evolving what we thought was a good breakfast sandwich that's why we did this or at least it's what i'm telling myself because i don't really know why so take that however you want no this is a thick man look my mouth can do a lot of things just not that respectfully look it slices pretty well this is like whenever ulysses eats it's because he has a small mouth it's also simultaneously big at the same time ladies and gentlemen wow that first bite despite the fact that the chicken fell directly out which we won't talk about sent me to the empire state building of sandwiches does that make sense you're right at the very tippy top here i am oh my god i'm so high okay there's a spire and this this is what's on top of that spire these buns are ridiculous they're actually much better than last time i don't know how good the chicken needed to happen let me quickly rewind this to when we first had the original breakfast sandwich the original breakfast sandwich is something that you make for sustenance to survive this is something that you make to have an experience to enter a luxurious zone a wonderland of textures and flavors crunches and softness smoothness and wetness if you will if you want a breakfast sandwich that will bring an experience that's going to knock your goddang pantaloons off kick your horse fly out the window like superman do a backflip in your cowboy boots in front of your family members and they think you're the coolest for it this is the sandwich for you otherwise you just make the other breakfast you wanna know what else has honkin buns filled with oozing goodness b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our breakfast sandwich this was an impeccable sandwich absolutely nothing wrong that i would point out with it i'm happy with every single element is it what i want for every single breakfast probably not no it's pretty work intensive but if you want to have a special breakfast day you got friends over family over you want to make something crazy or you just want to have a good time by yourself and have a lot left over that's just fine so with all that being said if you enjoyed

much per plate not so cheap when it could be the greatest of all time for this that is but cheaper [Music] okay so today we're making chow mein now I know this is a bit cheaper and oftentimes people are like don't have no I haven't even though it's like 15 to 25 and I could use it pretty much the rest of my life let me just say something got to make an investment on yourself but if you don't have the walk and you don't want to spend money on it I got you you can literally just use a pan just a big pan problem solved they also make induction safe walks there's your solution now as I said before chow mein is usually an afterthought people think oh Panda Express it's like four dollars for like a gigantic batch of just cabbage and greasy noodles we've already taken care of that I'm talking about the real chocolate the real stuff when you go to a restaurant and you get a big bowl of it with chicken or shrimp or whatever protein and there's real flavor involved this is kind of like Chinese yaki udon in a way sort of kind of not really you see where I'm going so why don't we make something that's worthy of sitting on the throne of noodle dishes for the cheapest price you'll ever make in your life now with all that being said let's make this shall we not only is this ridiculously cheap it's also one of the easiest recipes you'll see on this channel let's not waste any time farting around here and get this done first we need to make our chow mein sauce in a small bowl combine two and a half tablespoons or 38 grams of soy sauce one and a half tablespoons or 22 grams of rice vinegar two tablespoons or 40 grams of hoisin sauce 1 teaspoon or 4 grams of toasted sesame oil give it a little whisk no Whiskey Business today because I've had it up to here then whisk in two teaspoons or five grams of cornstarch until completely combined and pop that brother to the side now if you're a little sweetie pie and you're using a wok you're gonna need to season it first add just enough vegetable oil to make a little puddle on the bottom of your Wok crank the heat to medium high and let it heat swirling to coat the edges often until it begins to smoke then immediately discard the oil and wipe out the pan with a paper towel congratulations not only does your Wok look like it's the most polished marble in whatever hemisphere you're in but it's also season next get yourself a large pot of water boiling over medium-high heat and add 14 ounces or 400 grams of fresh chow mein or stir-fry noodles you can find these guys at most Asian markets and they're super affordable boil that for about 10 to 20 seconds or whatever the package directions say and immediately drain and rinse with cold water until completely cool to stop the cooking process now get back in that wok and add three tablespoons of 42 grams of vegetable oil heat over medium high until hotter than the surface of the Sun or maybe not quite that hot at 12 ounces or 300 40 grams of boneless skinless chicken thighs that have been cut into half inch cubes and I'd recommend searing this in two batches to avoid overcrowding and then just cook that bad boy until every piece is cooked all the way through and has some nice color on it this will take a few minutes so while that's going finely chop seven cloves of garlic and pop that into a pinch Bowl you'll thank me later you can also pre-prep all of your other vegetables chicken or julienne one whole carrot finely dice two ribs of celery cut two green onions into one inch segments and slice three and a half cups or 315 grams of Napa cabbage nice and thin granted green cabbage also works fine here so remove the meat from the wok and add your green onions stir fry that bad boy for about 30 seconds or till the greens are wilted and starting to char nicely then add three quarters of your finely chopped garlic and stir fry that until the garlic turns to a toasted golden brown color add your celery and carrots stir fry that for two minutes or until softened followed by your cabbage crank the heat to high and stir fry the absolute piss out of that for two minutes or until the cabbage is wilted it has a little bit of char turn the heat to medium high add your chicken back and stir fry until the chicken is hot again about 30 seconds add in one cup or 85 grams of well bean sprouts not a huge fan of them but you know they make sense here so it's fine now comes the Finishing Touch add your noodles in stir fry for about 45 seconds then add all of your chow mein sauce stir fry and toss until completely coated then add two tablespoons or 30 grams of water stir fry and toss again repeatedly for about one minute or until your noodles are beautifully glazed and coated with the elixir of flavor cut the heat and finish that off by tossing with your remaining garlic and stir until thoroughly combined and add additional soy sauce to taste if needed trust me when I say this raw garlic technique is not something you skip it really perfumes that thing with the spicy garlicky kick the I guarantee you're gonna get a kiss for now before you have a good old-fashioned you can serve this either in the pan itself with some green onion on top or you can dish it up per person individually and you guessed it green onion on top of that as well now of course optionally you can add other things like chili oil or a fried egg but that's all up to you and that is literally it we have a special chow mein that you need to sit down tuck in your napkin and respect while you eat it for this price per person let's taste test this and see if this chow mein tastes like it costs 20 times more than it actually does wow what is this what is this this isn't just chow mein it's a chicken chow me now what is that this is a whole meal if you're thinking about the Panda Express show me it's a completely different ball game because that's just a little side dish it's got like cabbage and that's really it you sit down with your family your dogs your children if you have them and you eat this for this price right here I'm just like I just came back from another planet perfectly cooked seasoned packed full of flavor Chow Mein noodles so got that and good this tastes like if you took takeout chow mein and then just and then this was birthed that's much cheaper buddy this is a goddamn eating experience you want to know what else has mounds of hot steamy noodles wafting in your face b-roll [Music] so we made our main event chicken chow mein for this price right here I don't know what's in this hand could be anything the editor could do anything at this moment I've had a lot of different noodle dishes I wish that I wouldn't make this more often not gonna lie I don't make chow mein every day four times a year that I sit back and I'm like oh maybe I'll make a quick little chow mein you know I usually do like a yaki udon I don't know whether or not I want to say this but I might just vote for this chow mein over the yaki udon call me Grace and I'm Gonna Save money that was an accident the Advent your choice is always in your hands should you want to make noodle dish that's going to blow everyone's pants off while spending zero dollars maybe not zero what was I saying anyway with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and I will see you next [Music]

Additional...",2022-11-24 21:59:44.386764, this is the most requested curry recipe from everywhere i've seen dms comments etc and simultaneously the best of all time [Music] okay so today we are making a thai green curry but not just a thai grain curry sure you go to the store get your little thai curry piece and then you mix it and cook it and it's great right you have instantaneously made the most boring thai green curry you can does that feel good feel good about that if you really want to make a thai green curry worthy of a little kiss from and maybe even a thai grandmother if you're so lucky then you're gonna make your own curry paste from scratch in a mortar and pestle by hand yes it takes time but i'm telling you this is life-altering flavor so without that being said let's make this shall we a proper thai green curry cannot exist without a green curry paste for going it would be like making a sandwich with no bread and yeah sure you can use store bought if you want it to taste the least flavorful and exciting as possible but if you want a curry so good that it makes your toes curl then you're going to want to make it yourself so let's begin there there are a lot of ingredients here but it's all going in one place this large mortar and pestle seen people use a blender then i've also seen people break their blenders making this so pre-grate your hard veggies like galangal and lemongrass before blending if you go that route but i'm gonna go mr traditional today so start by combining two teaspoons or four grams of coriander seeds 1 teaspoon or 2 grams of cumin seeds and 1 teaspoon or 3 grams of white peppercorns on a small baking dish pop those into an oven that's been preheated to 325 for about 5 minutes until lightly toasted you could also do this in a pan if you want then let this cool completely next get your veg prepped are you ready for this very thinly slice nine thai chilies three serrano chilies two small shallots seven cloves of garlic four cilantro stems no leaves one stock of lemongrass a two inch knob of peeled goulangal please do not use ginger here okay galangal is key here and lastly very finely chiffonade three kefir lime leaves now since these are all getting added in a specific order to make grinding easier align mine up and just by taking one look at these lovely aromatics makes me think that this could very well lead to a good old fashion nice slapping now get a large mortar and pestle start with your toasted spices grind those with your pestle until you get a powder then get a towel underneath because you're destroying your countertop follow that up with your sliced thai chilies grind those into a decently fine paste about one minute then add your sliced serranos and really get in there and grind all your chilies until as fine as possible this will take two to three minutes depending on your technique you might think oh wow this is pretty fine wrong you can always make it finer if it's fine enough the seeds won't really be visible from there i rough chop my sliced galangal and added that grind that down until it's pestified another one to two minutes then add your lemongrass which has also been pretty finely chopped grind that bad boy until pastified this one will take about three to four minutes to break down this is where technique comes in pal use human instinct sensuous motion use your grinder to press it along the wall as you gently twist your pestle to get it nice then grind in your kefir lime leaf till smooth followed by coriander stem also till smooth shallots grind till smooth your garlic now once it's nice and smooth finally the zest of one lime blended until smooth and last but not least finish that off with a half teaspoon or four grams of dried thai shrimp paste blending all that together and your paste is finally done totalling in at around 15 to 20 minutes of grinding yes it's tedious but the effort turns into reward when everyone is moaning at the dinner table you'll know it's smooth enough if you can form a ball with it like this hey yo it's the green curry paste ball oh my god can i have your autographed so on to the easiest part the curry in a medium sized pot add 2 tablespoons or 28 milliliters of vegetable oil heat that over medium heat until hot hot bing-bong then add all of your curry paste yep all of it if you want to have leftover curry paste then simply double the paste recipe when you make it cook that guy down stirring often until it's relatively dried out and is starting to stick to the bottom of the pan about three to four minutes then stir in five cloves of very finely chopped garlic let that cook for about 25 seconds or until fragrant then add three quarters of a cup or 177 milliliters of chicken stock stir that to dissolve the curry paste then add one tablespoon or 17 grams of palm sugar and 2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters of fish sauce stir till is dissolved then add one 13.5 ounce or 400 milliliter can of full fat coconut milk followed by three additional kefir lime leaves bring that to a light simmer and reduce the heat to low and if you wanted ultra velvety smooth then at this point you would blend it with a hand blender until as smooth as you like add in three quarters of a pound or 340 grams of boneless and skinless chicken thighs cut into half inch cubes stir that in and simmer for seven to eight minutes or until the chicken is cooked through now it's veggie time yay something healthy for once unless you're heavily allergic to nightshades then maybe not anyway add one to two thai eggplants sliced about half an inch thick serve that in and simmer for four minutes or until soft then follow that with one and a half cups or 160 grams of snow peas and then just simmer those snappers until they're softened to your liking i like my snap peas to have some crunch to them so one to two minutes is usually enough now once that's done season that to taste with the juice of one lime into taste with additional fish sauce and or palm sugar if you feel like it needs it albeit optional i really like to steep two large sprigs of thai basil in the hot curry to release some herbaceousness now you have an incredible curry which should be plated up as such nice big bowl beautifully steamed short grain rice on one side and nice heaping ladle fulls of curry on the other garnish that bad boy with fried shallots freshly sliced serrano chili and fresh thai basil leaves now this bowl right here in my opinion pays respect and homage to one of the greatest curries in the entire world that is for sure to brush your lips and splash upon your tongue to create a harmonious experience of drooling gasping moaning and above all smiling with the ones you love or you can just devour the whole thing by yourself totally cool anyway let's taste test this and see if we have a proper curry or not bing bong sorry but we're keeping it thai green curry a special curry one that's been requested many times is right here in front of me first i think we should just go for the the curry itself aside from all the vegetables and proteins and everything that's in there if you want to be hit right in the face with the most fresh thai green curry that you will taste assuming that you don't have a restaurant near you that makes it completely from scratch this is the recipe for you you can taste each individual aromatic the galangal the lemongrass you know the funny thing is the chilies aren't that spicy once everything's put together it seems like it would be really spicy it's really not very palatable spice level wise i'll give this uh for me like a four point twenty three four five six seven eight out of ten not that spicy as long as you don't launch it to the back of your throat everything comes together beautifully perfect thai green curry you can make at home and yes you should make the curry paste you're not making this without making the paste period end of story oh god damn you want to know what else is creamy and makes you sweat just a little b-roll [Music] all right guys so we made our thai green curry and it came out splendid once i made the paste you could smell the fragrance and it was added to the broth and you had all the creamy coconut milk and it just it just looked right one spoonful in the mouth instantly my brain was like this was worth it i'm doing this again this was 100 worth it sure it's annoying and obnoxious to have to grind it by hand and your arm gets tired oh and my arm's tired you know what we got it easy these days all right technology makes everything easy maybe go back in time a little bit and use some of that good old-fashioned elbow grease i promise you it's gonna be rewarding for this this is one of those recipes where i'm not just gonna say oh make it or not no you need to make this you need to so with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and we'll see you next time better make that goddamn curry all right real good [Music] you

people who've been complaining about josh you're too mean you're turning my feelings i really like dairy queen relax okay i'm sorry i don't what do you want me to do about it okay i like disneyland so i'm gonna say something good about it service 10 out of 10. so far everyone's been really nice the lady the ticket lady when we came in she was super sweet she said vikram looked cute so these are two different kinds uh they have a hot chocolate just i'm guessing cocoa powder and sugar on this one and then a traditional cinnamon on this one oh jeez okay i mean it's a churro i love churros i thought they would be frying them fresh because i've seen them fried fresh these weren't these were kind of like cremated and they put them in this toaster oven i thought that they wouldn't get crispy but they did this tastes like a fair food churro is it bad no i enjoy it if i was here just chilling i would be eating this 100 but you know how we do it here when you make things from scratch and you put in a little extra i think we can improve on this while still maintaining that traditionalist sort of fair food flavor hot chocolate i'm not picking up a hot cocoa flavor at all it tastes like a vanilla chow did i get a vanilla true it's just brown what does that mean poop there was a guy over there when i said that he just snapped i enjoy it it does taste like park food like it's very much just like this is a churro at a park it's it is just straight sugar i would rather just eat this plain this doesn't really add much to it i'd eat two to three and be happy all right so now we have to fly all the way home because we literally flew all the way out to california just to eat these we didn't really take any pictures or videos after this but uh vikram kevin and i proceeded to have a lot of fun after this video yeah trip well worth it churros should be simple so let's make this quick first we make our cinnamon sugar which although straightforward has an ideal ratio in a medium-ish bowl add 1.5 cups or 311 grams of white granulated sugar 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of ground cinnamon and just a pinch of fresh grated nutmeg whisk it together until place it into a container for tossing the churros in this is a shallow third pan and yes you will have leftover cinnamon sugar you're welcome now we have the coating but let's move on to the mexican hot chocolate ganache you're going to snack a small saucepan and add 1 cup or 240 grams of heavy whipping cream a quarter teaspoon or 2 grams of fine sea salt a quarter teaspoon or 1 gram of ground cayenne half a teaspoon of 1 gram of instant espresso and 1 teaspoon or 8 grams of ground cinnamon heat that over a medium till steamy hot but not boiling then pour that hot mixture over 7 ounces or 198 grams of dark chocolate around 70 that's been very finely chopped shake that lightly and let it sit for 2 minutes until everything is melted mixed together and you should have a beautifully smooth chocolate sauce keep that covered with plastic wrap in direct contact with the chocolate and keep it warm okay it's churro dough time very easy and similar to choux pastry shoe as in shoe not shoe in a medium sized pot add the beans from one vanilla bean one cup or 240 milliliters of water a third cup or 75 grams of unsalted butter 2 tablespoons or 28 grams of granulated sugar half a teaspoon or 4 grams of fine sea salt and 1 little drop of almond extract heat that over medium high until the butter is melted and the mixture is beginning to boil then stir in one cup plus one teaspoon or 160 grams of all-purpose flour mix it together with a spatula and keep stirring constantly once the dough is formed smooth and thoroughly combined and thickened remove it from the heat and allow it to cool for seven minutes then transfer that mixture to a large bowl and begin beating it with electric beaters start by beating in one whole egg until combined and then one additional egg which is a total of two eggs yeah basic math let's go beat it together until smooth and homogeneous now before putting in a piping bag let's have a very important conversation that for some reason i don't see enough the piping tip you choose is extremely important to those crispy edges in the shape of the churro my recommendation is the attack out number 846 link in the description anyway place that tip into a piping bag and fill your piping bag with all of your dough shake out any air bubbles next get yourself at least a two inch depth batch of fry oil in a pot heated to 350 to 360 degrees fahrenheit now you can totally pipe this straight into your fry oil and use greased scissors to cut it but if you want consistency then please pipe your churro dough into a straight stick on parchment paper to your desired length cut the dough with grease scissors and you should have a beautiful array of piped churros now cut a border in the parchment around each churro then carefully pick them up keeping them as straight as possible and gently lay them into the oil and allow to fry for a few seconds before removing the parchment paper then just cook two to four churros at a time letting those fry flipping occasionally until evenly golden brown and crisp on all sides about three to five minutes fish that there quip little man out of the oil and drain on a paper towel for a few seconds then while still piping hot no pun intended toss immediately in the cinnamon sugar until thoroughly coated on every single cranny crevice fill that crack okay this is yet another important note if the churro is not hot enough the sugar won't stick and let me tell you something it is an absolute bummer try to avoid it now repeat that with all of your churros and serve hot and crispy give it a dunk a moan and a kiss to the skies above for this is an earth shattering from me but first what if we stuff this with a dulce de leche cremo would that be naughty so to make your cremo model lord start with a medium-sized bowl and add three egg yolks let's get three tablespoons or 44 grams of granulated sugar two and a half tablespoons or 25 grams of corn starch whisk that aggressively until it turns lighter in color about one minute then in a medium sauce pot add one cup or 240 milliliters of whole milk half a teaspoon or four grams of fine sea salt in the beans from one vanilla bean pot heat that over medium heat until hot and steamy but not boiling slowly begin whisking that hot mixture into your yolk mixture in batches letting it incorporate in between and once the yolk mixture is nice and hot pour all of that back into the pot heat that over medium low whisking constantly until significantly thickened cut the heat and immediately mix in one and a half tablespoons of 21 grams of cold unsalted butter and just continuously mix until completely melted and emulsified and last whisk in half a cup or 110 grams of dulce de leche now pour that into a bowl set over an ice bath and cool that completely once it's cold fold in a quarter cup or 51 grams of mascarpone cheese till combined and finally fold in about one cup of whipped cream which is literally just a half cup or 120 grams of whipping cream whipped with one teaspoon or four grams of sugar still thickened to a whipped cream anyway once combined place it into a piping bag and sit in the freezer to firm up for about 15 minutes remove the centers from your fried and sugared churros with a straw like so and gently fill with your cremo and look i'll be honest these were unnecessarily annoying to fill the reality is that if you want to fill these they need to be fatter and shorter which you don't hear that often let's taste test and see how we match up with the legendary disneyland churro have our churros without the chocolate wow first off it really does have that fair flavor maybe it's just the idea of a churro that we associate with fair food this to me tastes like a gourmet elevated churro the inside is spunky this is a dulce de leche cremo phil churro wow that takes it from oh my god to like baka mommy this is fantastic on its own but if you want something elevated this is what you need all right we need to taste tester dick one it's a bit big for vikram's little mouth this is great i'd say the main difference between this one and the disney one is the disney one i was very focused on the exterior of it and how like hard it was this one still has the good crunchy bit but the inside is what i'm really focused on the pillowy texture of it try the cream-filled one that's the cremon gla or not that was great yeah this is fantastic we're gonna make anyone this is the one to do so with all that being said q music [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our disney land churros and you know what one of the things i'm starting to realize at this point is that oftentimes when you make something at home it is gonna be better because you're cooking it to the way that you want it or the exact specifications there was an inherent difference between these two the convenience of being at a theme park and enjoying churros is a special moment that i don't think is really recreatable at home but you can bring them home maybe you don't have time to go right this second but you're really craving that shirt well guess what we're here for you you're welcome that'll be four billion dollars or you

104,104,The Perfect Holiday Dinner (Homemade Peking Duck),https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mHxge9OncgY/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLCZuNgL1OT26Wv2iLnrlOKKMl09Lw,mHxge9OncgY,"10 minutes, 29 seconds","A holiday dinner should be special. So let's not make the same thing over and over and go a little more interesting... homemade Peking duck with all the fixings. 

Get My Cookbook: http://bit.ly/JW...",2022-11-24 21:59:44.386764, i feel like christmas is the time where people are like you know what maybe we won't have turkey we'll do something a little different maybe we'll do beef but what's next this the greatest roast of all time [Music] it's the time of the year again the weather's getting colder and you know what that means that means that it's time to play in the winter snow to make your mark on the wintery holiday season like my book is making its mark on the new york times best seller list thanks to you 40 off on amazon and it's a perfect gift for the holidays or a stocking stuffer christmas is here so as i was saying when it comes to a holiday meal whatever you celebrate doesn't matter but everyone's getting together and they're thinking probably that they're tired of turkey or maybe not maybe they make another turkey less to think about probably dry too don't tell me your turkey breast is moist okay it's it's probably not that's okay it's extremely difficult to get a moist turkey a lot of the time people are like oh i don't want beef i want something lighter because we're gonna have all these sides and the pies well okay what about another bird something flying around and it quacks a duck but you know not just any roast duck okay let's put some culture some refinement in it and instead make a new holiday dinner i want to see this on everybody's menu moving forward peking duck and you can do it at home so with all that being said let's make this shall we right oh so there are three main elements here the duck of course the honey plum sauce and last but not least the chinese mandarin pancakes which are sort of similar to a tortilla i don't want to hear the conversation all right oh josh that's a tortilla let's begin with our little ducky this might seem odd but uh you're gonna need a bike pump look don't make this weird okay essentially you need to separate as much of the skin from the meat as possible it helps with crispness you can start by wiggling your fingers in there until it's mostly separated but then i recommend using a bike pump to pump the air under the duck skin starting at the base nearest to the legs underneath the breast until it inflates nicely like this as odd as this looks and well sounds this is essential to giving this peaking duck its iconic crisp skin once it's done you're gonna make a quick five-spice szechuan seasoning by combining four tablespoons or 72 grams of kosher salt two and a half tablespoons or 31 grams of granulated sugar one tablespoon or five grams of chinese five spice and one and a half teaspoons or six grams of ground sichuan peppercorns no whisking this time i decided to shake it i guess so uh [Music] right season the duck underneath the skin specifically not on the skin and in the cavity next get a large pot filled with about 5 quarts or 4.75 liters of water bring that to a boil over medium-high heat and then immediately ladle that hot water onto the skin of the duck on every part where the skin covers the breast the legs the thighs the back the wings everything this helps keep the skin crisp by rendering out the fat and making the skin nice and tight repeat that process until you've used all of your water next let that air dry on a wire rack for about 10 minutes and while that's air drying in a small saucepan combine 2 cups or 480 milliliters of water 2 tablespoons or 24 grams of chinese red vinegar 1 tbsp or 12 grams of chinese black vinegar and 3 tablespoons or 45 milliliters of shao xing wine oh and also a quarter cup or 86 grams of maltose two very important notes about maltose number one it can be found pretty easily at a lot of asian grocery stores and number two it's extraordinarily annoying to work with and i would recommend that you warm it up in a microwave or in a hot water bath unless you want to face sticky doom now bring that mixture to a boil over medium-high heat and let that reduce for five minutes now your bird should be done air drying so pour half that mixture all over the breast side of the duck and then again on the back side of the duck again like i said coating all of the skin you do this if you want a skin so lacquered and beautiful you can see your reflection in it now you need to let this fella dry in the fridge overnight how you do that is up to you mine had plenty of excess skin on the neck so i hooked it and hung it in the fridge sorry for any unsuspecting family members or roommates who open the fridge or of course you can use a tall boy and well shove it in the cavity and stand it up so it's back and breast isn't touching anything so as previously described overnight in the fridge to try the skin so it's roasting day super duper easy get that there dry bird spank it a little just to prove that it's dry to the production crew adjust your oven racks to beat the bottom third of the oven preheat to 250 fahrenheit get yourself a tall boy can of whatever the heck you got pour out all the associated liquid you don't drink it if desired it's 10 am in this shot so i did this that's a joke i had a set though anyway fill the can back up with water so it's weighted and gently but lovingly assist your duck down and onto the cake make sure that it's standing up nicely and place it into your preheated oven close the door and using some sort of heat proof tool like a butter knife leave the door just slightly ajar this allows airflow to keep the skin extra dry please note that if you leave your oven door open crack that is make sure it doesn't have any fancy digital gauges and buttons around the opening otherwise you run the risk of destroying them so maybe don't do that you've been warped and roast that bad boy for 1 hour and 10 minutes okay the timer is rolling let's get a move on with these mandarin pancakes literally just mix one cup or 240 milliliters of hot water with two cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour carefully mix together until it forms a dough then knead until it's nice and smooth about five minutes so just let that bad boy rest covered with plastic wrap for 25 minutes then remove it from the plastic and divide it into evenly sized pieces form those pieces into big old balls and roll out your balls until you get a rough rectangle that's a quarter of an inch thick then using a three inch biscuit cutter cut them into nice little circles and simply repeat until you've used all of your dough and now you've got these cute little dough circles get yourself a cast iron pan preheating over medium high and i want that pan dry see we're kind of going in a tortilla-like direction anyway this is where things get a little bit different take two circles of the dough brush one of them lightly with toasted sesame oil and stack another piece on top of the oiled side press them lightly together and then roll that bad boy out into a six inch disk it's cool if the dough overlaps a little bit then just slap that brother into a hot pan and let it cook for 20 seconds or until get some nice color on it give it a flip and again another 20 to 25 seconds on the other side once that's done pull it off and pretty much immediately while it's still hot separate the two at the seam to get two beautiful sesame scented chinese mandarin pancakes then just rinse repeat with all your dough and keep your bounty of pancakes in a nice hand-knitted tortilla towel what ulysses grandma didn't knit you one sorry pal okay next up the honey plum sauce yep i got you doing work during this hour you got the time you can do it pit and chop one pound or 16 ounces of fresh plums and yes leave the skin on pop those bad boys into a medium saucepan and add two tablespoons or 38 grams of fig boy honey follow that with a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of rice vinegar a quarter cup or 58 grams of granulated sugar 2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters of schausing wine nice form pop that bad boy onto a stove set over medium high let it come to a boil and then just cook stirring occasionally for about seven minutes or until get a nice reduced syrup and the fruit is extremely soft then just pop that mixture into a blender and begin blending on high add in 2 tablespoons of 26 grams of dark soy sauce in a quarter cup or 52 grams of sriracha continue to blend until beautifully smooth and that is your sauce which goes unbelievably well with many other things should you have any leftover right so at this point that hour and ten for daffy is finished now just increase that oven temp to 400 fahrenheit and ideally on convection leaving the door cracked and cooked for 20 to 30 additional minutes rotating halfway in between until you have a beautiful stunning brown peeking duck pull that big board duck out and prepare to do something rather odd but important let me preface with this first sure you can serve the duck hole with your plum sauce julienne fresh cucumber optional julienne pickled carrots and very thinly sliced green onion looks lovely but my next option is much better upon removal of the duck immediately remove all the skin being careful not to burn yourself before resting the duck and place the crisp skin on a paper towel to drain then let your duck rest for 10 minutes that's what i would prefer to do next get yourself a sharp knife slice up the breast and thigh beat evenly about a quarter inch thick and then you can either cut up the legs or leave them whole now once you've sliced everything cut your skin to around the same width of your breast and thighs and layer the skin on top of all of the meat then place that on a serving tray laying out nice and neat you know keep it clean and serve immediately with the couture month previously described the sauce the cubes the optional carrots and the green onion of course let's not forget about your chinese pancakes don't be shy grab a flavored disc fill it plentifully with meats and skin cucumber carrot and of course your green and finally a nice dollop of your sweet sour and spicy plum sauce so sit down respectfully and enjoy a most pleasurable taste test bonjour a little bit of salt on this just to finish it off you can also use smoked salt if you want to be a little fancy boy right the flavor of this roasted duck is comparable to a rich stock it punches you in the mouth with flavor and you're like ah i have another bite and that's how it should make you feel chinese pancakes they're vehicles for flavor they're not supposed to taste like much other than a little bit of sesame oil this is how you serve it a little bit of ducky i like to mix the the fatty and the lean cucumber pickle carrot green onion plum sauce you see this you want to put this in your mouth fun fact if you google peeking duck and it explains the pronunciation need i say more it's peaking just like me all things considered what are you gonna make this holiday season you're gonna go to the old-fashioned turkey this is your answer you don't need to go to a fancy shop you could do it all at home you might as well take the time to make this thank you you wanna know what else has daffy duck crispier than ever before b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our new holiday bird peking duck now you don't have to have all the same accoutrements you could have your mashed potatoes or whatever else you want with this that's the beauty of peking ducks it goes with so many different things but i would recommend that you make some of the chinese pancakes and you make some of the little pickles you know and it's gonna be delicious it'll be a nice change of pace for everybody it feels exotic if it's not something you're used to and i promise you a picky aunt sally's gonna put a little bit of that in her mouth she's enjoying that i'll tell you right got dang now so with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and uh try to upgrade this holiday meal [Music]

105,105,The Cheapest Sandwich Ever (Chopped Cheese) | But Cheaper,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xf7JKgAhF3I/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBfV_yY7uw6c57CWjX2S9eSTWgDXQ,xf7JKgAhF3I,"13 minutes, 1 second","A bodega Chopped Cheese can be made homemade for even cheaper than you might have imagined. Homemade hero rolls are at the heart of this, but not before paying homage and respect to the humble...",2022-11-24 21:59:44.386764, so you want to have a sandwich and you spend 10 15 18 but there's a bodega sandwich that's much cheaper and when making it at home you can have it for this right here that is but cheaper [Music] oh this is the season the holidays oh what what do you want for christmas little boy santa i want a ps5 and i want the new halo well we uh those are those are you know there's supply chain issues those are out of stock so uh but i do have something for you we have the josh weissman an unapologetic cookbook and eight times new york times bestseller cookbook and it's 40 up on amazon the link is in the description what does that even mean it's a it's a great book it sucks santa it's a good book it's uh i heard that he worked really hard on it so we're not just making any ordinary sandwich we're making a chopped cheese i know this is a place that's very sensitive to a lot of people i want to pay respect to that i really do honestly so with it being something that's heavily scrutinized by new york i have someone directly a good friend from new york bing bong you already know what it is it's willie we're here today and we're going to be making the chopped cheese the new york way and the weissman way so put your tim's on and let's go to grand flavor central station flavor town baby we're gonna make two different ones we're making my version and your version which i don't know what it's gonna be at all we're just gonna play it out and see how it goes taste test them together we'll have our final prices and it'll be a beautiful time so a chopped cheese can go on many breads but the most common that you're going to see it on is a hero roll obviously we're making our own right so start with 302 grams of water at around 90 fahrenheit whisk in 8 grams of instant yeast until dissolved follow that with 33 grams of granulated sugar whisked until dissolved then pop that into your stand mixer with the dough spiral thing attachment on then in a separate bowl mix together 600 grams of bread flour with 14 grams of fine sea salt give that a nice little bread i know you might be thinking oh my god josh you're using grams well what if you can't get a scale is this butt cheaper well don't you worry because we'll have the conversions in the description which will also be on my website and yes we have a website it's joshweisman.com it's pretty great and if you've never been on it you should probably go there now next start your stand mixer and yes this can be done by hand add your flour a heaping spoonful at a time until all of it has been added let that mix for about five minutes until your dough begins to turn smooth then add a quarter cup or 56 grams of unsalted softened butter let that mix for another two minutes or until incorporated and smooth now if you do this by hand i would actually suggest that you replace the butter with vegetable oil and just add it directly to the flour then the water you'll figure it out once your dough is nice and smooth shave it into a bowl place it in a greased bowl cover with plastic wrap oh wow what a very nice name and let it rise for one hour at room temp or until doubled and from there degas your dough by punching every last bit of love out of it then divide into eight evenly sized balls cover your balls with a damp towel and rest for 10 minutes then roll those bad boys out into a rectangle that's roughly 7 by 4 inches then starting from the long side roll it tightly into a log seal the seam then roll it all the way out to the ends to taper trying not to get it too long alright we're not making baguettes here pop that onto a baking sheet lightly dusted with cornmeal and repeat with all your little hero roll men now once those bad boys are shaped cover that with another baking sheet inverted wrap it with plastic wrap to prevent any sort of draft and let that proof at room temp for 30 minutes ding ding reminder time now would be a great time to pre-heat your oven at 375 fahrenheit now once you're ready whisk together one egg white in 120 milliliters of water until thoroughly combined you can totally brush this on your bread and it's going to be great but if you want to look like a total genius and you happen to have a spray bottle then pop it in there and spray your dough to coat evenly and lightly with egg wash then using a sharp razor score your dough at a 35 degree angle about a quarter of an inch deep into the dough then pop it in the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes remove and totally optionally brush with melted butter then cool on a wire rack until completely cool now look these aren't supposed to look crazy artisanal like we usually do around here let's keep them humble now we're pretty much ready to cook but first let's make a quick little mayo hot sauce into a small bowl get one cup or 240 grams of mayo hit that with about three tablespoons or 38 grams of a hot sauce of your choice i'm using crystal but you know you can use whatever you like and you know what screw it a little bit of worcestershire sauce about one tablespoon or 14 grams of it give it a whisk season your taste of salt as needed and that's it okay flat top time first thing split a hero roll leaving one side attached and toast it lightly on a flat top and increase the heat to medium-high add a little oil then add a small handful of sliced onions this is just a julienne sweet onion and half of a thinly sliced serrano chili mind you this is enough for one sandwich so if you're doing a bunch then obviously scale up as needed season a taste with salt then saute that until softened and lightly charred about two to three minutes push it to the side now grab a decent handful of ground beef and listen up this is important get the highest fat percentage ground beef you can find okay i don't want any of that 90 on here plop it directly on your flat top which should be screaming hot at this point spread the meat out so you get a good sear let it cook for about two to three minutes then flip and season immediately with salt and any other seasonings you might want you could add cajun seasoning that might be sacrilege so we'll pretend that i didn't do that start chopping it using your spatula and get it as finely as you can then just let that cook stirring and occasionally you know you really want to get those beefy crispy yum yum bits now toss the meat with the vegetables back together line it up roughly into the shape of your bread obviously add a little bit of finely chopped raw garlic fold it together until just hot layer on two slices of american yes american cheese there's no debate here and if you want to piss someone off you can add a slice of swiss cheese as well and now okay hear me out in this moment of time there was a heavy debate here it was stressful do i let the cheese melt on top and just pop it on the roll do i chop it up and fold the cheese together to create a cheesy beefy amalgamation you know and it is called the chopped cheese so you know i chopped the cheese and folded it together all right and guess what i regretted it immediately but you know what we have yet to taste it so let's just finish it up by waiting for that cheese to get nice and melty and hot getting a toasted bun hitting it with our hot sauce mayo a generous drizzle of ketchup pepper your buns plop that meaty cheesy beast onto your bread stuck on some thinly sliced thick tomato which has been salted and peppered and left to sit for about 10 minutes and finally some very thinly sliced fresh iceberg lettuce then immediately tightly wrap it up in a sandwich paper to serve to a hungry individual that deserves love because we all deserve love now it's time to taste test this alongside with our new york rep see what he has to say about it and uh pray i suppose oh i'll be honest chop cheese is not about looking beautiful it's about feeling beautiful it's about tasting something that makes you both emotionally and physically feel beautiful i feel like we've paid somewhat homage to how a chopped cheese should be made although i made a couple modifications which may or may not anger some people i have somebody in the building who probably has something to say about it and he can say his piece in a second we got the bodega wrap the beauty of wrapping a sandwich like this isn't just to wrap it and keep it warm it's that it conforms like a makimono roll you take this up and wait a minute that once messy little sandwich is now a beautifully conformed sandwich ingenuity perfectly seasoned it's got a little bit of spice from the serranos from the cajun spice but it's not overbearing it's not taking over the flavor of what a chopped cheese should be the tomato the lettuce it all plays in beautifully to me it tastes like an ordinary chopped cheese but like a little bit more a little more elevated but all for this price right here with homemade bread pretty goddamn good if you ask me if you don't live in new york you could be the bodega i need my guest sir william to enter the frame let's see what we got here i will definitely agree with you about the elevation tactics and making it at home is definitely the like the coolest part about a chopped cheese it's an anytime any day sandwich breakfast lunch or dinner be honest with me don't skip me on the rules alright be honest with you you got the basics but you know i noticed a couple of things in your process that were different than the things i noticed are a repeating pattern in the bodega process more lettuce less flies i think more more lettuce yeah overall i mean it's a badass chopped cheese for someone who is not from new york and doesn't eat these when they're drunk or hung over on the train but that's what they're all about show us your version and uh and and show me the ways of a chopped cheese please let's get first things first what i always notice at the bodega is they throw the meat down first i am gonna use less meat than josh i saw his tactic and it was interesting and cool but yeah normally they'll throw about i'd say like that much maybe a little bit more like that and then they hit it with decent amount salt a little bit more decent amount of pepper the spatula and this plancha chopping thingy is the normal tactics that i see and i also noticed that josh had put the veggies down first the bodega way they like get the meat nice and crispy almost and then they add the veggies at the end to kind of rehydrate it maybe it's some secret bodega tactic it's very important to be as loud and obnoxious as possible when you're chopping it i noticed the meat almost not not getting burnt but you want it to get those crispy morsels you know so this sandwich means a lot to me i've been really broke and down and out in new york and it's saved me a lot of money just being able to go to a bodega and spend three bucks to eight bucks josh makes like my favorite bread ever yeah we can get it even more crispy honestly then you chop your veg into it after the meat cooks traditionally you would never do this with me but i always notice that this is the way that they do it but it's kind of cool because you get a little bit more of like a crunch from the onions and the peppers now josh literally chopped the cheese for the record there's beef fat on the ground which is what you want i literally saw five videos back to back in a bodega where they chopped the damn cheese and folded it together i'm walking away i'm walking are there there's certain places that do it differently this is just the way that i've normally seen we'll let that get a little toasty roasty normally they don't use two cheeses but i honestly like was inspired by josh go like that boom some shreddedness a couple slices of tomat yeah it's looking beautiful oh god all right we'll go upstairs and wrap this up all right so here we go i definitely agree with josh about the makimono comment that he made and me and josh actually both used to work in the same sushi restaurant it's true it like brings the sandwich together it kind of like forms it boom there we go there's a lot of things i'm regretting right now the first thing is i argued against cutting out bias because of the type of sandwich it was but structurally i mean i really like the way you did it i wish that i had put the cheese on top and didn't fold it in i felt like the cheese was lost when i folded it as opposed to now it's like i can see the cheese should we eat it yeah chops cheers shop cheers between two friends close friends very good it tastes exactly like the bodega one that i had like exactly wow i'm flattered all the memories that i had of that bodega chop cheese i had like four or five years ago it's all coming back now it's kind of an ethereal thought process it's hard to describe really but it's not just putting goddamn things together putting kids it's not just about the ingredients it's something about the process and that just goes to show how important technique is enough is enough anybody in anything can be technique it's about tradition and culture not just doing yeah brother i've actually never made a chopped cheese myself i've just seen it i've except for right now i've seen it get made over and over again and i knew in my head if i just copied the way that they did it that it would be bad ass i impressed myself thank you you big hunk of man when the you want to know what else has a big thick spatula chopping up chunky piles of meat b-roll [Music] [Music] okay so what did we learn well today we learned that there's an incredible sandwich out there for the most unbelievable price of this right here but i think the more important lesson not everything is about money some things are more about technique they're about culture they're about how they make you feel the way you assemble it the way you put things together significantly affects the final product of anything absolutely like i said never made one before but i knew it was gonna be good because i've seen it done a million times and it's been good every single time so i hope that we paid tribute to this incredible sandwich from an incredible city you know maybe you saved yourself some money but maybe you freaking learned yourself something for once with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and we'll see you next time bing bong

106,106,Perfect Chicken Tortilla Soup Traditional Vs. Fancy,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8de5voo8-m8/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLDuR3f36XH1yGQzHy2SyioETcEvQA,8de5voo8-m8,"10 minutes, 54 seconds",Homemade chicken tortilla soup is the only way to the best chicken tortilla soup of your life. Today we're making a traditional version and an ultra-fancy version. Is there a winner... or are...,2022-11-24 21:59:44.386764, we all love fried food and we all love soup so just literally put them together [Music] it's christmas thank you vic it's christmas christmas it's christmas christmas it's christmas christmas it's christmas what did santa get us for christmas i think he got his legos man maybe it's hot wheels what what the is this oh oh you kids i actually got you something this year it'll learn you something a new york times bestseller seven times forty percent off on amazon the links in the description i don't know how to read you kids in the broken learning system okay so today we are making chicken tortilla soup it's like the combination of three of the greatest foods in the world fried food aka tortilla chips soup which is great it's great granted it's a little more seasonal but whatever and you've got cheese and i mean cheesy cheese the kind where you put the spoon in and you got the cheese pull and your mouth is watering and you want to wrap it around your tongue like some sort of string and castrate your tongue i don't know where i'm going with this the point is that if you're not eating tortilla soup when the winter season is hitting then now is the time and you can make the best version with this recipe so with all that said let's make this shall we okay of course there is no chicken tortilla soup without some nice tortilla chips code red you might think buying tortilla chips and using those is some sort of life hack but it's not it might save you time i won't lie there but frying your own tortillas is going to give you a better crunch with more corn flavor plus you can let them fry for a touch longer and get an even deeper flavor than you would from any other chip you can have control of your life plus obviously you can control the size and the shape yadda yada so literally just take 20 corn tortillas cut them into half inch wide strips and in batches fry them in about one and a half quarts of vegetable oil that's been heated to 350 fahrenheit until they begin to stop bubbling and turn to a golden brown color remove and drain on a wire rack and season generously with salt let those cool completely and just rinse and repeat with the rest and you'll end up with the crunchiest most delectable chip strips i'm telling you a freshly fried chip is inexplicably better than one that sat in a bag for a month all right it's time for start with a medium-sized pot and add just enough oil to cook the bottom of the pan and heat over medium-high grassland yourself one pound of boneless skinless chicken thighs and season them to taste with salt and any other seasonings of choice i use my cajun creole seasoning from the gumbo video then once your oil is hot hot oh my lord please call the cattle home sear your chicken in batches for two to three minutes per side until beautifully browned and place on a sheet to the side as you sear the rest yes the chicken will be undercooked fear not we're going to finish that later reduce the heat to medium and add four ounces or 113 grams of bacon that's been cut into half-inch thick boy cubes and cooked that stirring often until beautifully crispy and a nice fond has developed in the bottom of the pan oh it's time for a culinary preschool lesson a fond is the stuck brown yum yum that coats the bottom of your pans it is the heart of your flavors you simply need to coax them into your final dish get it now add in one very finely diced medium sweet onion two serrano chilis sliced and five cloves of garlic very finely chopped season lightly with salt stir together and let that sweat down until everything has softened about 3 minutes then add 2 teaspoons or 2 grams of ground cumin 1 tsp or 1 gram of ground coriander 1 teaspoon or 1 gram of smoked paprika and half a teaspoon or 1 gram of ground cinnamon stir and cook until toasted and fragrant about 30 seconds now add two guajillo chilies and one dried ancho chili both de-seeded in the cores of two corn cobs both of which have been cut in half to fit better uh wait a minute josh where did you get those there are corn kernels added to this later so if you use a proper ear of corn to do that and remove the kernels yourself then you'll be left with these bad boys they're optional but they add a massive amount of flavor anyway add one quart or one liter of good chicken stock scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon add your chicken back increase the heat to medium-high and as soon as it starts to boil immediately reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked and the broth is undeniably delicious your dried chili should be very soft so fish those out and carefully place them in a blender discard your corn cobs because you fully maximize their purpose then remove your chicken and place it to the side as well now this next part is critical and not skippable little in one and a half cups or so of your broth in your blender and blend your chilies on high speed until extremely smooth and bright orange pour that back in your simmering broth and stir together now this not only enriches your broth tenfold with savory chili flavor but it makes the color a gorgeous deep reddish orange from there add in half of a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes to the broth then allow that to simmer and reduce while you shred all of your chicken with two forks until finely shredded let your broth reduce for an additional five minutes turn off the heat add all of your chicken back along with those corn kernels from two ears of corn optionally reserving some extra kernels for garnishing later then just stir until everything is hot homies please listen up at this stage do not boil again with the chicken in it if you boil the chicken will go rubbery and guess what not one kiss for you but if it doesn't then you get a big fat taste and adjust salt as needed and add a tablespoon of fresh chopped cilantro to freshen now your good soup is done moving on let's talk about how to bowl this guy up in a nice bowl add your tortilla chips to your heart's content then top that bad boy with shredded bacon cheese and shredded cheddar again to your discretion on the amount if you have a kitchen torch give these a little pre-melt if desired otherwise the soup will do the melting for you then ladle in your hot soup nice and generously top that filler with more tortilla chips fresh diced avocado optional extra raw corn kernels and finally fresh cilantro leaves to garnish now this looks like a got dang chicken tortilla soup that is ready to energize you on the pasture and get you some cheesy crunch in your belly now let's taste test this and see how we did wow that is a god dang chicken tortilla soup vibe freaking one alright sick and tired of all the chicken stock onion and taco seasoning and then calling that chicken tortilla soup stop it it's gonna be much worse than no kiss specialty silver spoon lime wedge i mean just look at this color it's viscous it's got texture to it it's cheese pulling not even for papa for mama good lord good god this chicken tortilla soup isn't for the faint of art this is for people who love passionately feel intensely i don't know how else to say that then this is a perfect chicken tortilla soup could it be made different ways 100 you could add tomatoes all sorts of different ways but the flavors in this are punching you on every single taste bud the crunch from the fresh tortillas plus the little soggy ones that almost act as like a chewy crunchy noodle you heard that crunch the corn the avocado it's actually spicy this isn't a butt better but i think someone needs to taste this get in here matt get a new we need a new spoon you know how do you eat chicken tortilla soup i usually just dive in that's what i also do oh my god dude that's so good the corn with the avocado busting yeah now while we enjoyed and love this soup i think that it's time we move on over to something maybe a little different could we make a fine dining chicken tortilla soup right so we made our perfect chicken tortilla soup what about a fancy version josh sure you might not have asked for it but we're gonna do it anyway i'm gonna call this the chicken tortilla espuma toastada so i did a couple things here first our chip element instead is going to be a classic tostada base simply fried a corn tortilla whole at 350 fahrenheit till crisp and golden then drain it on a wire rack and season to taste with salt for the aspuma i blended together 35 grams of tomato paste 150 milliliters of our chicken tortilla soup and 100 milliliters of cream blend that until very smooth adding soup if needed to loosen then place that hot liquid in an isi canister close the top and aerate it with one charge give it a little shake and that's your espuma now i wanted the chicken flavor to be punchy but obviously add it in an unexpected way so i took some chicken skins and roasted them in the oven at 350 fahrenheit on convection until golden and crisp then drain them on paper towels and season them generously with kosher salt then just let those babies cool and they're kind of like the greatest chicken-flavored chip you'll ever eat in your life as another garnish to bring that guajillo flavor more forward i took a guajillo chili and very finely chiffonade that bad boy kind of looks like hair which is gross when you make that comparison but it's fine in that same hot oil from frying i popped that in there and let it fry out very quickly about 15 seconds then immediately drained it on a paper towel and seasoned with salt these little guys pack a wallop in the pants with a nice crunchy yum yum now to put it all together cue the fine dining music we begin with a nice stoneware plate atop that we lay our base a hand-fried tostada topped with our chicken tortilla espuma towering shards of roasted chicken skin chips a beautiful line of toasted guajillo and finished with fresh herbs now this right here is a fine dining chicken tortilla soup and in my opinion it kind of makes sense now let's see if a this tastes like chicken tortilla soup and b if it's even good at all look at that does that look like chicken tortilla soup to you uh no welcome to fine dining that's the whole point uh we're gonna finish a little bit of salt flaky salt i forgot to season the foam so how do we eat this well i don't really know because i just made it up these crispy guajillos shout out to yuma very good idea strong move i'll just break it all right that's a good bite right there a little bit of chicken foam so it's sort of like all the bare necessities of the flavors of chicken tortilla soup but it's a little bit elevated texturally different and there's more elements to it that make it more viscerally exciting hold on a minute not only is this absolutely delicious it has the flavors of chicken tortilla soup but so many more textures it's so much more complex someone should come try this this is actually kind of ballin i think there's something here more than what we made the textures are really what gets me like the creaminess of the soup cream the saltiness from like that chicken skin it's just all blended together very well those ground chilis this dude gets it so what did we learn today warm yourself up one of the greatest tortilla soups ever or one of the greatest little fancy chip things you're gonna ever have do it you wanna know what else is full of cheese and shards of absolute crunch b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our chicken tortilla soup quite descriptive in the name right it's chicken it's tortillas and it's soup but it's also much much more than that you combine all these different ingredients fried and unfried sauteed and unsaute simmered down to the most beautiful concoction that is greater than the sum of its parts what more do you want and it takes like 20 minutes to make so i'm tired of people complaining like oh it takes too long okay you have time to watch game of thrones for four hours pano reruns and reruns and reruns then you have time to make this so with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you [Music] you

the best that's ever existed [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right everybody i got the white elephant gifts you don't forget to pass them around all right guys let's open them it was 40 off and the link was in the description did i say more and a seven times new york times bestseller the link is in the description okay so today we're making the quesarito the name itself sends chills down my spine and not in a good way it makes me sad and depressed and it just shouldn't exist i understand what they were thinking right they're in the boardroom and they're like oh quesadilla but what if we made it into a burrito oh frank what do we do what do we call it oh my god well burrito and quesadilla quesarito really who got the pay raise for that terrible terrible but nonetheless people love it they've asked for us to do it making things the way that we do homemade tortillas homemade nacho cheese everything from scratch and you know what we're gonna have a fun little twist with the meat so let's make this shall we wow there it is taco bell i think we've actually been to this one but it's time for the three-point system just visually right off the bat this looks like a taco bell from 1995. is that when they were found there they were founded at this point in time it looks very old these are some nice screens though so you know what i'll give it a 2.3 75 out of 4.6 because of the sign can i get two uh quesaritos they'll do beef back to the three-point system so the next one service she seems like she's having a bad day she does not seem like she's having a good time so i'm gonna give him a five out of ten because i feel bad i hope she has a better day thank you these literally feel like two hot turds in my lap straight up the dog just pooped i picked it up and i'm like i'll take this home i guess to eat and then of course there's the menu it's relatively unchanged the food sucks but the consistency very good and by good i mean they haven't changed their menu in 430 years so i'll give it a two out of ten and a half two and a half out of ten that's how we go eat this so we have the bag this is good you know this is fine i like the way that these bags are made they're simple they're very cheap but that's fine no modern art thank you taco bell i can't believe i'm saying this it smells like absolutely nothing somehow which is actually kind of surprising i've never actually seen one of these in person so let's google a quick image of what this should look like this they're saying it's this where to meet at did i not order a beef is this the vegetarian version oh it's in there it's just kind of holy hi vikram this is single-handedly the worst thing i've put in my mouth in the last five years of my life i'm not going to analyze it because it is just that bad if what we make today is not better than this i will stand on the top of the empire state building wearing nothing but a taco bell flag ah a quesarito literally just the quesadilla used to wrap a burrito how ingenious i guess the elements are simple tortilla utterly perfect rice chipotle sauce papas nacho cheese and of course the meat so good that it practically descended from mount olympus let's begin with the element that is the least respected in this quesarito the meat i mean let's be honest nothing's really respected in this piece of rito look we're not doing ground beef pal i refuse this could be so much better than that so instead i made my birya recipe yes we made a got dang jw barrier quesorito this is the exact same recipe as the one that is in my uh well peria quesa taco video so if you want to make that the link is in the description but the short version is essentially fatty short ribs and oxtail braised in aromatics and chilis till undeniably tender the meat is then separated shredded into the most voluptuous beautiful glistening beef of all time the chilies are then blended with some of the consummate and added back to the broth the meat is then seasoned with salt a little bit of consomme and you now have meat for filling and consummate for dipping birya is one of those things that contributes to the world in a way that makes life undeniably beautiful and worth fighting for now assuming that's done let's make the rest let's go for a buttered cilantro lime rice it's easy using a rice cooker which you should be using one snag yourself and a half cups or 309 grams of medium grain white rice tired of saying it really am i'm sure people are tired of hearing it but wash your goddang rasp until the water runs clear i'm not running you through this for the millionth time so pop that bad boy in the rice cooker with equal parts water so one and a half cups or 360 milliliters close the lid and turn it on yes very nice once the rice is cooked fluff it and immediately mix it with the zest of one lime two tablespoons or 12 grams of finely chopped cilantro 2 tablespoons or 44 grams of unsalted butter then mix that until the butter is completely melted and incorporated in the rice season and taste with lime juice and salt and that's your rice please be careful mixing this so you don't you know destroy crush and break your rice it's no good next is a creamy chipotle sauce luxurious in flavor as it is in beauty in a blender add one seven ounce can of chipotles in adobo all of it two tablespoons are 26 grams of hot sauce which could be anything you want you like cholula great put that in there three large cloves of garlic turn on your blender then remember to plug it in and then actually turn on your blender people are always commenting oh josh there's no way you forgot that you did that for the camera you don't know what i'm capable of okay then just blend that until smooth as possible then in a medium-sized bowl add one cup or 228 grams of mayonnaise all of your blended chipotle puree salted taste then whisk together until completely combined and that is your chipotle sauce now i know this is simple but this thing will kick you right in the pants with flavor now for the tortillas this is the bane of the entire existence of this recipe you are going to have a hard time finding tortillas large enough because they need to be slightly larger than 12 inches something closer to 13 to 14 inches and for some reason you can't really find that so guess what that's why we make our own are we certain to get it god i'm trying to tell people make your goddamn food from scratch all right makes a lot better makes it easier to do whatever you want anyway we have tortilla recipes everywhere so i'll make this quick in a bowl add two cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour one and a half teaspoons or six grams of baking powder and one teaspoon or four grams of fine sea salt whisk that together until thoroughly combined then separately we have three quarters of a cup or 180 milliliters of hot water mix in a third cup or 62 grams of vegetable oil then while constantly stirring your dry mixture with a fork stream in your oil mixture and once it forms a shaggy dough begin needing that filler to get a soft smooth dough about five minutes cover that with grease plastic wrap give it a personality that anyone could revere and respect and let it rest for 30 minutes once it's had a little nappy wrappy and it needs its mommy you're it's mommy then you need to remove the plastic wrap and divide into five even pieces of course you can use your scale if you want that ultra accurate like weigh your whole dough divide by five see what i'm saying here now just roll those into rough balls lightly flour one of your balls flatten your ball into a disc and then roll it out until you get a circle that's about 13 inches or slightly more in diameter and it should be quite thin but not so thin that it tears which i feel like is obvious but you know gotta say it anyway so what do you do if it sticks huh gonna run around and cry gonna go cry to your mama gonna go call papa no you just dust with a little bit of flour now we only have one issue when it comes to cooking this you need a big cooking surface so either use a very large pan ideally a comal would work great here or if you happen to have a giant griddle like me then use that heat that brother up until it's so hot you slap your goddang horse's behind and send it on home then toss the tortilla on and once it begins to bubble up and get some color about 15 seconds flip it and cook again for another 15 to 20 seconds yes this thing should cook fast pop that onto a baking sheet lime with a towel or if you're really lucky ulysses incredible grandmother will hand knit them for you thank you isadore besos parati now just keep those brothers warm and set them to the side last but certainly far from least is our nacho cheese is there velveeta in this josh no but there is a touch of american cheese which i guess is kind of similar but not quite the same in a saucepan add two half tablespoons or 50 grams of unsalted butter heat over medium heat until that's melted then add two half tablespoons or 27 grams of all-purpose flour whisk that together and cook while stirring constantly for about 45 seconds then whisk in a quarter teaspoon or one gram of cayenne powder let that toast for 15 seconds and then add one and a quarter cup or 300 milliliters of whole milk let that heat until it thickens and look if it gets too thick then guess what you do you add a little bit more milk like a couple tablespoons until it is not like a sludge once that's hot and beginning to bubble stir in four ounces or 113 grams of grated cheddar let them melt completely and then stir in 3 ounces or 85 grams of grated american cheese yes you can buy blocks of it stir that until completely season a taste with salt if needed and that is your nacho cheese sauce now set that to the side and keep it hot if it cools it will start to solidify so if it does just warm that up until it's melted again okay i think we're ready for one of my favorite assemblies i've seen here are you ready you better get your popcorn sit down on a chair right put the massage function on your chair light a candle turn the lights down poor little glass of champagne or sparkling apple juice if you are not of age now please lay down a big boy tortilla spread on enough grated cheddar to create a very thin but even layer of cheese drizzle that with your nacho cheese and look admittedly i could have gone a lot heavier here but it is what it is then another layer of grated cheddar now top that with another equally sized tortilla wow that's funny it looks like we're making a quesadilla hmm press that to adhere then on the bottom third add your cilantro rice be judicious on how much you put you know you put too much it's gonna be hard to close top the rice with more nacho cheese add on a fat stack of your juicy delectable berea beef hit that with a drizzle of sour cream followed by a generous drizzle of your chipotle sauce add on a nice little garden of fresh cilantro leaves for freshness if you're the type of person that complains about cilantro being soapy tasting get out i'm just kidding you don't have to put it on it's fine now stand back think about your life for a second and then do your best rolling job you have ever done in history make sure it's tight and well folded but not so tight it'll bust it open now heat up a 12 inch skillet over medium heat with a little bit of spray oil in it and i would recommend going nonstick for this stainless steel not so great then let that sit for two to three minutes undisturbed until toasted get a spat flip to toast the other side then after two minutes and both sides are beautifully toasted make sure your cheese is all melted if it's not leave it in the pan until it is and your masterpiece is done a masterpiece that i think we need to see a cross section on let's just get a little sound bite of that and good lord it's got the oozing cheese pull the anatomy of a burrito but hold on we need to get a little bowl of birya consummate garnished with fresh sweet onion and chopped cilantro and let's get a little dip into the consummate it has the drip the red hue that symbolizes flavor and a little bit of spice and good lord cross my heart spank my knee take my foot off and throw it out the window like a boomerang and hope to have a good old-fashioned bus because that is something you do not see every day i'm about to take this here burrito into the next room next door to enjoy its flavors in privacy so that others can't see the facial expression i'm gonna make right that's what i'm saying all right thanks for watching do i need to say more i mean really there's actually more beef in this one which is great good for you guys that smells like a foot this smells like if you were in a taqueria on mount olympus with lavender growing out of your shoes i don't know what the last note was i was just trying to think of something else theatrical so this has already been dipped a few times in the uh the birya consummate it's red hued it's got a scent to it i think i'd like to bite this by the microphone if you don't mind kendrick may i i'm speechless this absolute log has left me speechless i wanted to take that a step further but i'm not going to a dunk jesus christ maybe a little extra sauce and it holds together look at that i think something's happening i can hear church bells ringing and angels are flying in the air and they're whole oh they're dropping big pieces of beery and meat in my mouth ah ah it's a wonderland the point that i'm trying to make is whether this is a what is this a called a case of burrito quesorito i see how they created that name now whether this is a quesarito or not or cheese filled quesadilla burrito this is probably one of the greatest burrito taco related things i've put in my mouth in my entire life oh we won we're gonna need a taste tester yeah the little man is here he got a new haircut it looks so pretty so vikram uh can you tell us about how you feel about quesoritos never had one it looks disgusting appalled okay so we have number one coming straight for your tight little mouth open wide sweetheart are you ready to swallow number two that was awful all right yours is number one and better that was just an awful experience i could smell this coming and it smelled amazing the whole way through just end this all right let's end this um you want to know what else has a cheesy meat torpedo ready for launch b-roll [Music] our guys in that is it so we made our quesarito every time i say the word it's just like a little my hairs stand up immediately not right shouldn't exist and you know what i think that we made something that is worthy of existing should it be remade over and over and eaten on a daily basis probably not unless you want to go to the hospital but it is at least worthy of standing on a plate in front of people who care about food that's what this is all about so are you gonna make this probably not let's be honest who's making this are you gonna make a 14 inch tortilla if you have a plancha for it i guess i just wait wait in two to three weeks we're gonna see restaurants putting this out and be like oh we have a restaurant qui cerrito yeah i wonder where that came from anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a

and the french come together and put an end to that with one of the greatest sandwiches of all time [Music] ah [Music] something missing now it feels like the holidays and it could feel like the holidays for you too if you click the link in the description it's 40 off on amazon and that's six times the new york times bestseller thanks to you happy holidays well we're finally here we're making bond me people have asked for it over and over and over which by the way thank you for all of your requests i do read them i still do you send them to me on instagram through dm and if you don't follow me what are you doing link is in the description and of course we have a discord server the link is also in the description for that drop us your recommendations because we love to do them now to the bond me hands down one of my most favorite sandwiches of all time and it was one of my staples when i was still a line cooker right before work grab a bottom weed pack it up go to work eat the bottom in the middle of the service be like that's freaking good it just energizes you it's the perfect balance of salty fatty sweet pickled encapsulated in a sandwich before i'm on my soapbox for too long let's make this shall we there are five elements that make the most incredible bon me number one the bread you must have the most delectable of fresh baked grain-based torpedoes that you can possibly find ideally made by yourself using my baguette recipe which the link is in the description or you can go to your best local bakery if you have one number two balanced pickles number three ultra fresh ingredients obviously we've heard this a million times so that should go without saying and number four a stupid dummy yummy sauce that makes you shout mommy on the rooftops and number five a protein treated with love like this unbelievably crispy skinned pork belly now let's begin with our three pepper crispy pork belly you'll start with a two to three pound pork belly with the skin on obviously now before even cooking this you need to place it on a wire rack season it with salt on both sides and let it sit uncovered in your fridge overnight to completely dry the skin if you want that crunchy yum yum now these bellies have already been portioned cured and dried by yours truly so once it's been dried season with a mixture of salted taste and a pepper powder of one tablespoon or nine grams of black peppercorns one tablespoon or three grams of sichuan peppercorns and one tablespoon or nine grams of white peppercorns blended into well a powder and be sure to hit it just on the meaty underside and not the skin now place that in some foil and wrap just the underside leaving a nice border around the edges with the skin completely exposed rub a thin veneer of vegetable oil on the skin give it a nice massage and season the skin generously with kosher salt and ideally flaky salt now pop that bad boy in an oven set to 300 degrees fahrenheit and roast for two and a half hours checking halfway to make sure the foil is still snug and if your meat has had some shrinkage hey don't feel embarrassed it happens to everyone you can tighten the foil if necessary but usually it's not a huge issue now once it's done take it out of the foil and pop it onto a wire rack set over a foil lined baking sheet and i saw this sort of interesting method around the internet where people are putting balls of foil underneath parts of the pork they kind of sink down so that the skin is nice and level i usually don't do this so it's optional and i only saw a slight increase in consistency this way now crank the oven temperature to 500 degrees fahrenheit or 475 if that's your oven's max for 25 to 30 minutes or until the skin starts to puff a little and is crispy and crunchy now while that's finishing in the oven let's get our accoutrement put together first the pickles real easy place three julienne carrots in a quart container and about half a small daikon julienne to roughly the same size place that in a pint container obviously any heat proof container is gonna work don't give me the hole josh i don't have deli containers wham use a mason jar or a pyrex all is possible when you make papa's pickles now in your little sauce pot of secrets add one cup or 240 milliliters of rice vinegar 1 cup or 240 milliliters of water 2 tablespoons or 28 grams of granulated sugar 1 tablespoon or 10 grams of kosher salt 1 tablespoon or 5 grams of coriander seeds and 2 pieces of lime zest bring that up to a boil then immediately remove from the heat and strain that hot liquid over your vegetables to submerge them you could pickle these guys mixed together but i prefer to keep them separate for more versatility and how they can be used now just let those sit until they reach room temperature and you have pickles now what is the sandwich without [Music] this is a kefir sweet chili sauce it's good and very easy to make in a saucepot add three quarters of a cup or 151 grams of granulated sugar a quarter cup or 63 grams of sambal olek 1 cup or 211 grams of rice vinegar a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of water 2 tablespoons or 20 grams of that good fish sauce then give that some whiskey turn the heat to medium high and bring that to a boil then just let that bad boy reduce for five minutes then in a small bowl whisk together one tablespoon or eight grams of cornstarch with a splash of water to make a slurry pour that into your sweet chili sauce reduce the heat to low and let that simmer while stirring until thickened then cut the heat then add eight cloves of finely chopped garlic and two kefir lime leaves bruised and let those flavors get to understand one another okay back to the crunchy little men once the pork is done in is just absolutely stunning pop it out and let it rest uncovered for five to ten minutes just let those juicy juices collect and then all you gotta do is slice would you recommend you get those slices generously thick about half an inch and please use a serrated knife to get through that skin more effectively and just look at that juicy crackly symphony that will make your eyes well up with tears of joy now we have mostly everything we need we just need to cut our baguette into 12 inch segments you'll need two baguettes for four people most likely wrap those brothers up in foil and pop into a warm oven for about five to ten minutes slice up some fresh cucumber coins thinly slice some fresh chilies of choice i prefer red fresno but jalapeno would be just as delicious in its assembly time grab your hot bread cut it so one side is connected generously mayo the inside if you're a real one lay down as much of that beautiful pork belly inside as you desire shingle on your fresh sliced cucumber followed by a lovely stack of your pickled vegetables your sliced spicy peppers of choice and finally a little green garden of fresh cilantro and that right there isn't just some sandwich that is a full-on cultural eating experience now ready to put it in our mouth and see how we did wow the unbelievable airy puffy undeniably crunchy crispy i'm not talk that's a goddamn sandwich right there oh no it happened again hello it's so beautiful in here it smells like fried pork skin i love it oh do you want to transport to another land you'll make this sandwich this is this is the perfect bon me in my opinion honest to god you got your pickled vegetables the acidity it cuts through the richness of the pork belly but the pork belly is so juicy so fatty so salty that what is it three four pepper spice comes through that's what you get but it doesn't stop there right maybe maybe you want a little something extra okay maybe put a little bit of this on there my life is complete thank you god bless you wanna know what else has crisp golden skin and makes juicy juicy yum yum b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our bun me beautiful luxurious crispy skinned pork undeniably good now it could have puffed a little more or i would have liked it to be more cloudy looking on the top you know like a bit of more of a chicharron but it's all right it's okay honestly it actually worked out quite well the inside was nice and airy crunchy i was a big fan of it so if you're looking to make that crispy pork belly now you have that recipe and when you do make it you know what to put it in which is this bun me it's honestly not that complicated and if you don't want to go super hard and make that pork you could just do ground pork with similar spices and then put that in there that's fine or steak or chicken or literally anything can you comprehend the greatness but this sandwich has to offer you so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned

109,109,30 Cent Gourmet Donuts (3 Ways) | But Cheaper,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CcjHH9l4HNs/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLDwt1jVGNbVGpuFo8SruK6BCmtEOA,CcjHH9l4HNs,"11 minutes, 6 seconds","These homemade donuts are the best you will ever make in your life. Cocoa puff peanut butter donuts, toasted marshmallow cornflake donuts, and a classic plain glazed... all of that, and it's...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, this seems like an odd one for us donuts are already one of the cheapest foods on the planet coming in at this price per donut on average but that's just for a plain glaze what if you want something ultra gourmet for this price that's but cheaper so [Music] you know the holidays are right around the corner which means it's time to get nice and snuggly with the ones that you love here have a little hot cocoa oh you spilled some there we go oh better still a whole 40 off on amazon this six times new york times best seller is available and the link is in the description happy holidays all like our donuts we have our favorite places that we go to etc i don't understand why people have them for breakfast by the way is that really a thing best way to ruin your day you eat three donuts at 8am rest of your day screw tired the entire day the point is i wanted to make a donut that is relatively cheaper than the average just plain glazed donut but instead of it being plain glaze we're gonna take it all the way we're talking fully homemade dough that's got maxed out buttery flavor but on top of that we're making ultra gourmet donuts with their own toppings multi-tiered multi-level with like cereal or cereal milk and you go to like a fancy donut shop and it's like four or five dollars a donut can it be done so with all that being said let's make this shall we i've simultaneously figured out how to make donuts undeniably soft and undeniably cheap well i guess they've always been cheap yes there is a rematch for the krispy kreme coming and i have not forgotten anyway in a container add one and a half cups or 360 milliliters of whole milk at around 95 fahrenheit to that you'll whisk in one tablespoon or 11 grams of instant yeast followed by a third cup or 74 grams of granulated white sugar then in a small bowl add two whole eggs cracked obviously and one egg yolk add your yeasty milky mommy mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer whisk your eggs together and add that as well begin mixing on medium speed then whisk together four and a half cups or 675 grams of all-purpose flour with one teaspoon or six grams of fine sea salt then while your stand mixer is constantly mixing add your flour mixture about three tablespoons at a time until all of your flour has been added and a dough has formed then reduce the mixer speed to medium-low and knead for one minute then add half a cup or 115 grams of unsalted softened butter let that breather incorporate and mix for five minutes or until you have a beautifully smooth dough and it's starting to pull from the sides of the bowl yes the dough will be a little bit sticky it's highly hydrated and that's okay that's what we want take a deep breath in let it out we're making donuts not a large hadron collider now give that brother a couple needs by hand then plop it into a large grease bowl form it into a rough ball cover with plastic wrap and give it a passive aggressive name this time and let that rise at room temp for one and a half hours or until doubled and as thick as my thighs moving magic and it's done dust up with flour and observe the fact that this dough now has life then just lightly pat all of that life out of the dough until completely degassed pop that into a lightly floured work surface dust the top of flour and roll it with a rolling pin until you get a large rectangle that's about three quarters of an inch thick and at this point you could totally use a donut cutter which i don't have one instead use a three inch biscuit cutter to cut out as many rounds as possible then use a smaller circular biscuit cutter to cut out the hole see now you know why they're called donut holes ah yes increasing your business margins while also glazing holes anyway once you've punched out as much of the dough as possible you'll have a ton of dough scrap knead it lightly together to homogenize and let that rest for five minutes roll it back out and cut again yes you can cut more depending on their size you should get 20 to 25 donuts but i went extra large but i would actually advise against doing that because these were so big that it was kind of hard to eat an entire one by itself anyway cover with plastic wrap and let that proof at room temp for 45 minutes or until puffed like a baby so we're past the hard part it's smooth sailing from here as long as you're not a ding-dong and behave recklessly with your fry oh you should be good fill a large heavy bottom pot just slightly over halfway with vegetable oil and heat it to 350 fahrenheit using a greased flat spatula carefully pick up a donut lay it into the oil and fry two to three donuts at a time accounting for expansion so they don't overcrowd the pot and form into weird square shapes the frying portion happens pretty quickly so i'd say about 45 seconds to a minute then flip and repeat on the other side we don't want these to get super dark we want them sort of a darkish tannish color an over fried donut is a depressing donut you know something like this beautifully smooth round by good lord i could kiss it except i wouldn't because it's extraordinarily hot so instead i sniff pull that out of the oil train on a wire rack and repeat with all of your donuts in their accompanying holes until you've fried all your donut baby men now let those bad boys cool and before we discuss our topping let's just look at these things they're absolutely ridiculous in how aerated and soft they are i mean look at the inside of that puppy snake my drain prank call my cousin spank a squirrel i could smell the sweet yeasty aroma right now now we can discuss our toppings this is where we save our money the most a gourmet donut can get very expensive when it comes to toppings usage of vanilla beans expensive chocolates which don't get me wrong i'm a big fan of that but how do we leverage exciting dessert flavors without cost well turns out cereal you all know i have a soft spot for cereal so let's not get hung up on that while we may have the necessary plain glazed the real stars are two others a cereal milk corn flake donut in a double chocolate peanut butter puff doughnut if your whole body isn't tingling a little right now i don't know what to do for you pal be worried that the price is really only calculated for one of these options but you could do all three without changing the price too much okay so the plain glaze is simple in a large bowl add five cups or 641 grams of confectioner's sugar that's little fancy pants pastry talk for powdered sugar mix it together with half a cup or 118 grams of hot water go slow with the water here at first you may need to use slightly less depending on your humidity etc then add one teaspoon or 4 grams of vanilla extract and a tiny pinch of salt whisk together until completely smooth and homogenized and it should be thick enough to sort of cling to the whisk like this and that's it it's done then all you do is dunk a cool donut in and coat both sides thoroughly drain in a wire rack and repeat with your donuts now moving on to cereal milk look all you really need is a half cup or 15 to 20 grams of cereal of choice cover that with half a cup or 120 milliliters of whole milk we got our corn flakes frosted flakes peanut butter puffs and fruity pebbles which you know not so into fruity pebbles but they got that pizzazz in this relatively monochromatic lineup then just let those bad boys sit at room temp for 10 minutes or in the fridge covered overnight if you want that maximum flavor granted if you're gonna go max on flavor i do suggest making a larger batch so you have extra for other usages and uh it's not a waste of time now strain the cereal out of the milk and you have cereal flavored infused milk now you simply just use that milk to make an icing for donuts yep that's it so get yourself two cups or 250 grams of powdered sugar and add just enough of your cereal milk of choice so that it's about twice as thick as your plain glaze coating you want this to cling to the top of your donuts and hold so it should be very thick you may only use a couple tablespoons of milk now once it's done take a cool donut dip just the top into it let it drain slightly give it a little spin spin flip so the unglazed side faces down on the wire rack and then top one side with the correlating cereal you know i did a little bit offset for the culinary last but far from least is the double chalky way for the chocolate glaze to a medium bowl add two cups or 250 grams of powdered sugar four and a half tablespoons or 24 grams of cocoa powder small pinch of salt whisk together then whisk in a quarter cup of 40 grams of cereal milk this cereal milk is cocoa puff milk of course makes sense whisk that until thoroughly combined and you should have a beautifully thick glaze for the peanut butter drizzle simply whisk together 3 tablespoons or 64 grams of peanut butter with half a cup or 47 grams of powdered sugar yes it will be thick relax thin that out with water until it reaches a consistency that's drizzable but still relatively thick same thing as before get a cool donut dip just one side to coat with the glaze let it even itself out slightly then this time immediately dunk that glaze side into a bowl of cocoa puffs please underwear rack unglazed side down then immediately drizzle with your peanut butter icing and so we're done a beautiful row of donuts a nice subtle mix of highs and lows to make for an undeniably cheap and mouth-watering gourmet donut for the price of this per serving right got dang here that is how you butt cheaper folks now let's taste test these and see if we can get that gourmet out of body experience that we all desire we have donuts to eat here we have a classic glazed donut and i'm talking properly glazed i mean it gets that that means it's got a candied like crust a chocolate donut with reese's puffs and a peanut butter topping then we have a frosted flake donut also known as my cereal milk donut you can do this with any kind of cereal that you want all right first bite this is single-handedly the best donut we've made on this channel period end of story it like breathed air into my body it was like next one okay i will be honest it's just kind of rip up the roof of your mouth upon the first bite but then it just beats the life out of you with unbelievable chocolatey peanut butter flavor dude yeah so then the next one this straight up tastes like a toasted marshmallow why this price for glazed this price for chocolate and this price for our i guess toasted marshmallow at an average price of this right here for gourmet donuts dude now you go on get your fry all rolling you call that girl becky back don't you be scared you can do it you want to know what else is glazed plump and fragrant b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we have our gourmet donuts it doesn't just have to be a cereal donut to be gourmet which almost seems like a mixture of highs and lows it's gourmet but it has cereal on it when you make a donut at home not only do you have complete and utter control of the size the way they look the way they're fried how long they're fried what they're coated in the flavors that they have maybe you mix a little bit of orange zest in your dough and you're like god dang and it's the same freaking price and arguably better you can top this with whatever you want and chances are it's not going to make that price go up egregiously unless you start throwing an expensive stuff like vanilla bean which i'm not saying i'm not guilty of that it's like that kid in that one meme where his head veins popping and he's on his desk and he's like how do people do that on tick tock in 10 years they're going to go to their doctor and their doctor is going to be like you're going to die like tomorrow what are you doing so what we learned today was you can make a donut for very cheap and you could also go to the hospital if you do that don't do that that's not good for your health

put myself in a place where i don't and i compete with an expert [Music] this is damon hello yes uh good friend of mine i've worked with him for many years he's a trained sushi expert okay he understands sushi in out upside down all around done right can we agree with that for the most yep what was that that's how you make the gear the more you move your arms the better it comes out is that true expert we actually worked in the same restaurant for a while together and i never came to the sushi bar but i watched him do his thing all right i've always wanted to go up there and do something so now we're here now we're doing it he's gonna run me through the entire process and i'm gonna challenge him the best of my ability to keep up with him and see if you know there's a good chance that i'll win i think potentially maybe not a good chance what do we think that percentage is editor of the day ah that looks pretty good i understand what's going on sushi requires a lot of attention to detail there's multiple layers it's about the rice that's the most important element it's about the fish the way you cut it the quality of the fish there are so many different elements people don't get it get it in your brain this takes time we want to show it the respect that it deserves and damon's going to be our shepherd my sushi mommy gonna give you a good spanking so damon first step please the most important element can you walk us through the rice absolutely follow me howdy y'all we're about to make some sushi rice i've got five quarts first thing we have to do is rinse all the starch off this is the rice nut we're going to be using to make sure the rice doesn't stick to the bottom of the cooker here we get about three wrenches off of this guy the first wrench is always the starchiest we're gonna use this almost as like our strainer here gonna lift that up and dump this old water out all the white stuff has to go away number two the goal is to have it under water for between seven to ten minutes so with each rinse we get lighter softer and softer like a soft ocean breeze number two all right we got our third rinse coming here easy kind of like a sunday morning you can see now that the water is almost see-through it's not milky milky cocoa puff anymore now what we're going to do is we're going to let this sit for about 10-15 minutes it's called a hungarian take that sushi rice once it's fully cooked put it inside of here we take a sushi vinegar which is rice wine vinegar heat it up seeped with kombu seaweed and then salt and sugar mixed into it for seasoning pour the sushi rice over and we cut the vinegar into the rice not only does that season but it also allows the rice to be separated so that it is equally malleable when we actually go to make the sushi this is the wooden spoon that we use to spain all these sushi chips and make bad sushi rice all that water has now soaked up you can't feel it through the screen but you can at least see how dry the granules are when it turns to powder take my breath away it right in i'm going to add a little more water than i normally would to accommodate for the humidity outside we're gonna add it on in if the water gets past my middle knuckle i know that i have more water than i usually need and you can see that water is right before my knuckle now unfortunately because i only actually need one quart of sushi rice i can't show you the cutting process but here's the video of josh doing wow josh great job okay so how'd it go did you pick it up no look at that here i am big ass tub of right yeah that's what you think but it's oh yeah rice is done what's next fish fish this is a fish did you know that i had no idea actually well you can tell it's a fish because of the way that it is this is a hawaiian amberjack it's a hawaiian what amberjack i really enjoy this fish i thought you said you'd only broken it down three times well i have but it's really similar to a lot of why don't we choose a fish that you've only broken down three times to break down on camera i don't know man we're just gonna go for it bud watch for these barbs because they it has poisson in it poison poison the french foison is fish in french poison in french it's it's fish back check on that thank you i thought you were supposed to be the expert not in french are you ready why don't you stand over here why so you can see better who's training oh my god now when it comes to sushi every bit of this fish counts so we want to try to get as much as possible first incision is going to be at a slight angle okay make that cut and we're going to follow it all the way down the bottom and now i'm just riding that that bone up until i get to the spine here but over you'll break through the bone if your knife is too sharp i'm actually going to start at the bottom a push cut at an angle right and then i flatten out take your towel you hold and you ride right up the spot come back cut through the bottom and you have a beautifully played fish i missed a little bit right here let's get a little nervous all right you're up are you left-handed i am left i had no idea that you were left-handed really till today that's why i'm so funny how's that correlate well i'm funny honey just drag the knife all the way down just one nice slice terrible wow now you flatten the knife tilt it this way okay remember let the knife do the work yeah you're doing really bad try to feel that bone oh okay i hear it do you want to feel the spine without feeling like you're cutting through the spine yeah you hear that you hear that uh-huh oh you are cutting a little bit through the spine a little bit yeah well you're cutting a little bit this way it's it's caught on it all right mommy's got you dude it's really not that bad it's not terrible it's it's better than anticipated this is what i do when i mess up a fish a little bit scrape it out so it looks like i did a really good job and i'm like wow there's like no meat so we learned how to break down fish wasn't as hard as i thought but at the same time i think it's like one of those things where it's repetition repetition repetition and then you finally get it that's not about right so moving on we're gonna go into makimono we're making one makimoto and two nigiri so three things total god this is gonna be a long day roasted seaweed these are wooden cutting boards these are old-school oh really it's actually made out of cardboard they replace them every day sanitary purposes the reason we don't use a dry board is because when you try to apply the rice to the nori it's gonna slide all around your board get your hands damp a little moist collection of water all over you stay moist grow up go goose egg size of rice the less you touch the rice the less it will stick to your hand beautiful wow oh and you're gonna very lightly press this around your nori until you have a nice even coating of rice okay you want to leave a little lip up here and i'll explain that why later sesame seeds a little shake and the old fliparoo cucumber you want to build from the center you want all your ingredients to be consistent all the way through that way every cut is going to have the exact same amount right every bite tastes the same i'm going to take our tuna right along these your hands are like water moving on there avocado this is the hard part when you go to roll place it onto that avocado you tuck everything in and you want this rice to meet up with the end of this nori so you want to check make sure everything's stuck jesus wow if you don't want anything on the outside you press it right now make it look uniform turn it into a square a house a house it's like flat bottom apple bottom jeans boots with a fur that now i get it if you want something on the outside you don't press the rest okay because right now it's going to be able to catch these beautiful i don't know who made these i would literally sleep on these press on the top press on the sides by pressing in pressing down boom you're gonna roll it forward form that side and then voila get your knife a little bit wet wet knife keeps it from sticking exactly you want a much more of a slicing motion rather than either a push down or a sawing back and forth you cut in half amazing you must memorize what size the piece needs to be like i have done two three i'm going to trim trim at the end and then let's see how well i did wow look at that what's that all right now you remember that little do you have this avocado here no okay who's the teacher here [Laughter] you remember that little piece of space we left at the top of the door yes and i told you that you want rice to connect with rice yeah if you don't leave that little space what you're gonna have is a bulge of rice somewhere like this this piece didn't quite connect properly pops out into like a triangle shape right here yeah and then this one's like a beautiful circle that's what you're looking for in compass and then you transfer this over to a plate dame man i'm not recreating that what is that that's my name just looks like you went like this no i didn't do that they're so even okay so this is the crunchy tuna it's got avocado cucumber tuna and then what's this mayo jalapeno you forgot there's jalapeno in there oh there's also jalapeno that's the spicy probably should have had you explain this anyway it's okay this is a white chili aioli oh i remember this recipe yeah i've made this plenty of times i hated it i hated it out of the way let's make our nigiri let's make some of the gears we'll do fish first and then avocado it's going to look something like this you like it that thick i like it thick yeah and juicy i don't like it thick you like a juicy though i like a juicy can you just pay attention you're talking you slice just to follow it through so fluid wow follow the angle that you see here okay start at the thickness that you want you want to use the whole length of your blade yeah there you go and turn it much better i mean honestly look at these you could hardly tell the difference of these if your eyes were closed and sweat form it into a ball you want to be light okay you don't want to think about that girl who stood you up in trouble that's not how we do things around here not anymore damon you don't pick up the fish until you make the rice ball because you want to preserve the temperature of the fish and the warmness of the rice the longer it stays in your hand the hotter the fish is going to get we're going to form push it in form like this until it gets to the form that you're looking for a nice hump that's insane the ball of rice really conforms nicely to the size of the fish because initially when i first saw it i was like that's way too big this is beautiful i had no idea you started with such a small ball small balls can lead to big things next nigiri it's going to be vegetable that's a fruit this is actually a fruit all right we're going to start by wow yeah how long it took me to master that peel the avocado you've done this before right yes okay good peeled an avocado yeah you're not moving the knife you're moving the avocado conceptually that seems pretty straightforward can i give it a shot with this one yeah you got me getting the one that has like a [ __ ] broken piece on it i didn't give you anything you grabbed it right follow the shape of the avocado yeah oh well you went straight across you want to follow the avocado because you're looking for length push the avocado down ah beautiful there's your nigiri piece right there you can try to get another one uh we're going to do the same thing that we did with the dagiri only we're going to do with the rice ball move your hands a lot and what's going to happen we're going to put it right here we're going to form it into a square flip it foam and that's what we want such a vague thing to say move your hands a lot there's absolutely no point in moving your hands around i was more envisioning myself outside a walmart ringing the bells you're going to take your avocado and you're just going to place it right on top i don't like this chunk missing i was a bit peckish in english we call this a seatbelt because we're going to strap this avocado in for a ride when we fold it and place it back just like that and then boom it's done the thing that i'm noticing is like beginning to end every single movement has a purpose that holds the entire thing together basically if you skip one thing it will immediately be disassembled this is the level of consistency that's required of every single roll and you're putting these in and out day in day out not only do you never stop getting better the only way you really get better is through repetition anybody technically could make this to geary piece but somebody who's trained in it can make it look really good and they can make it really fast and it's just a matter of how fast and how good can you make it we've learned everything we need to learn let's put it to the test he's going to time himself making all of these and i'm going to time myself making all of them see if i can match his years of making the same thing over and over and over and over literally thousands of times he's got the rice he's got the nori down god you spread it so quickly he does this every single day however many how many of these you make like a hundred two hundred you know you don't have to answer that just focus on what you're doing i'd probably make when i work on the maki station i probably make at least 250 rolls a day power to guess i'm [ __ ] i oh it's that last end really determines a lot oh those are even better than your first one i just had to do a fat i don't even have a poor time oh in the nigiri sorry clean up three squeeze down elbow on it's the time the restaurant's going to be open by the time i'm done all right sure we'll see how this goes honestly when it comes to the gear making you just have to do it okay because you think about it like this that's what everybody sees what you just saw was a bunch of jargon that's what i saw when they were like just do it like this i'm gonna go for the gary first considering i don't know how to do it it'll probably take me the most one out of time yeah here we go it looks kind of like what you did and then the fish goes on and then you form it i don't know what the [ __ ] i'm doing all right we'll call we'll call that done avocado that goes right on your little seat belts it's not an ob shaking not the one kenobi style though done okay jesus christ this is broken it's a little bunch jesus the fact that you keep it from sticking to your hands is amazing this is the part where you have a lot of speed on me okay goes on i'm missing rice on a part of it that's gonna come back to bite me in the ass later tuna that's the glue cucumber come on jalapeno i feel like i'm forgetting something then you roll it into here it's not connected at all ah jeez back over that's all you did yeah just quick minimal jesus christ it's like sticking yeah i gotta wet the knife you're right [Music] all right those are really bad you tried your best bud almost twice as long and they look horrifying bring his over here yeah pretty distinct difference there these are really bad that's where the reps come in though you know you do it over and over and over at a certain speed and that accuracy is like built into your body speed it up slow it down you're gonna hit that mark every single time that's the consistency

you're asking that question then you've never had tom yum it is hands down one of the greatest soups that has ever been created by a human being period end of story i'm not getting that deep into it it is the perfect mix of flavors i can possibly think of as soon as it lands on your tongue it hits every single segment of your brain 100 you know they say like oh you only use a certain percentage of your brain which i'm pretty sure that was proven incorrect but this got thing tom young will make you use 100 of your got dang noggin i'll tell you that oftentimes when people make tom yum these a lot of things like pre-made non-prick and they don't really make their own seafood stock we're doing absolutely everything from scratch and that includes our own non-prick pal now let's make this shall we it's tummy yummy mommy time all right we have two elements to make our tom yum first you cannot do anything until you've made your own non-prick pal sorry you're not going to the store this time buddy first off you'll get an irreplaceable feeling of accomplishment of making it yourself which is a nice boost of serotonin i'm gonna assume you might want that i don't know and you'll have tons of this delicious stuff to put on your rice and or all over your body because it is that good and the second element to your tom yum is the well actual tom yum which much of its base flavor will be created with that non-prick now let's go to npp town that's short for knob first let's prepare our tamarind get yourself a third cup or 90 grams of tamarind paste this stuff is thicker than my thigh so to get that worked pop it into a bowl and pour over half a cup or 120 milliliters of boiling hot water stir it and let it sit for a few minutes stir again until smooth then pass it through a mesh strainer until the majority of it has passed through and nothing else will and well that's it that just gets any potential seed fragments out and it turns it into a more fluid paste the rest is very very easy get a nice wok and add one and a quarter cup or 295 milliliters of vegetable oil and actually wait let me preface the next bit we're doing the following recipe pretty much a hundred percent in grams oh why josh why did you do this to us well because a proper non-prick pal needs to be highly consistent and due to the fact that each vegetable is incredibly different in size well we do it in grams so please take any complaints to the comments and potentially receive a kiss from papa before heating that oil add 50 grams of garlic peeled and thinly slice then turn the heat to medium and let that bad boy naturally come up first the garlic will start to bubble then fry and let that bad boy cook stirring occasionally until the garlic is toasted and golden brown remove from the oil with a skimmer and place on a paper towel to drain next add 100 grams of peeled and thinly sliced shallots leave the oil on medium and let those bad boys fry stirring constantly then once most of the bubbling has subsided and they're a nice golden brown quickly remove them from the oil and yes they will continue to brown when removing them so you know try to be a little preemptive here and drain on a paper towel last you'll add 50 grams of de-seeded dried puya or arbol chilies gently stir those in fry for about 20 to 30 seconds or until fragrant and beginning to darken remove and drain yet again on a paper towel this just helps get the chilies toasted more specifically crunchy while those bad boys are cooling add 25 grams of dried shrimp to a food processor and process on high until you get as fine of a powder as possible dump that out then in the same food processor add your fried chilies fried garlic and shallots now don't try to get smart when making this recipe and try to do the dried shrimp with the chilis and garlic because the shrimp won't get fine enough like that papa makes his recipes a certain way for a certain reason i'm tired of the dms oh but baba i made your recipe and this got messed up and all i did was change this step anyway blend that on high until you get a fine but slightly crumbly mixture and well that's it one sniff this will certainly cause a good old-fashioned buzz all right back to your wok with the oil from earlier pop that bad boy on medium heat until uh pot then add your shrimp powder lightly stir fry till fragrant then add 150 grams of palm sugar that's been crushed nicely cook together stirring constantly until your palm sugar is completely dissolved then stir in your chili mixture your tamarind paste 90 grams of fish sauce then just let that simmer stirring often until slightly thickened and that's your non-prick pour that into a bowl and let it cool completely yes this will thicken significantly when cooled it's more of a jam if anything now it's tom yum time first get yourself one and a half pounds of head on shrimp or ideally tiger prawns if you can get your hands on them remove their heads and shells place in a separate bowl of course devein your shrimp as well now first in a medium stock pot at all of your shrimp heads and shells the heads are a massive driver of flavor so i would strongly advise against making this without the heads you know do you want a kiss or not cover that with three and a half cups or 830 milliliters of water heat over medium high and as soon as it starts to come to a boil lower the heat to medium low and simmer till reduced to about three cups skimming any foam that rises to the top about 10 minutes straighten out the heads and shells and you have your shrimp stock now get a large piece of cheesecloth and add two stalks of lemongrass sliced and a two inch knob of galango peeled and sliced as well wrap that up tightly to make a sachet and tie together with kitchen twine to fully enclose so it doesn't open in the good soup in a small stock pot add just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pot heat over medium high until hot hot hot then add two heads of mini beech mushrooms with their base cut off and two king oyster mushrooms sliced shear that for three minutes stirring occasionally until you get some nice browning and the mushrooms are softened remove those then add a quarter cup or 80 grams of your non-prick pow from earlier and five cloves of garlic thinly sliced and five thai chilies thinly sliced so let's say that until fragrant about 30 seconds add in your sachet then all of your shrimp stock followed by seven kefir lime leaves then just bring them to a light simmer over medium heat and cook for 15 minutes add your mushrooms back to the pot then add your peeled and deveined shrimp from earlier reduce the heat to low and gently cook those for two to three more minutes or just until your shrimp is cooked through remove your sachet and squeeze any yummy juices then hit that with a quarter cup or 55 grams of fish sauce 3 tablespoons of 38 grams of lime juice and 3 tablespoons or 42 grams of palm sugar give it a taste and adjust the seasoning as needed you know oftentimes when i make this i find myself going back and forth between all three of those seasonings you gotta get that balanced harmony of rich umami saltiness a fair level of sweetness and a nice zingy tartness it's kind of hard to describe unless you've had it the right way play with it until it tastes incredible to you optionally you can toss in half a bunch of cilantro and thai basil to steep in the hot broth just before serving and then well guess what get yourself a bowl serve it up i like to add a little bit of the oil from the non-prick pal to each bowl but you could also use regular chili oil garnish with fresh cilantro leaves now that looks like a god dang near perfect bowl of tom yum that was given about all the love it deserves and we could stop there but as soon as i tasted this it was so god dang good it felt like a borderline fancy experience so obviously i made a fancy version this is more of a technique rather than just a recipe so let's play it out first here's the elements to the dish seared king oyster mushrooms browned butter lobster scallion emulsification and sort of a coconut enriched tom yum now first our mushrooms were sliced about a half inch thick scored in a cross hatch and seared in a pan i used a weight to keep them pressed down for even searing flip to enjoy a visceral deep browning on each beautiful mushroom season with salt only to highlight that classic mushroom flavor for the scallion puree i literally simmered two bunches of scallions or green onions in water until incredibly soft added to a blender with a few cloves of garlic and a splash of rice vinegar blended it on high until super smooth then emulsified with a couple tablespoons of toasted sesame oil and the rest with vegetable oil until it reached the desired consistency and thick mesh pass through fine mesh strainer season the taste of salt and added to a squirty squirt bottle as for the lobster i kept it simple take a lobster from a shell while it's still raw gently to keep it you know intact be sure to remove its vein if not already then i just laid that in the same cooking water that we used for the scallions to import some of that green onion flavor to the lobster and very very gently kept it in that hot water bath till cooked through about three to four minutes then i removed it brush it with hot brown butter and for the coconut tom yum i mixed equal parts of our fully seasoned tom yum with coconut cream then passed it through a mesh trainer seasoned with salt if needed and finally plating place your lobster tail in the center of the plate oh boy i can already feel the coming slice the sear mushroom thick boy in half lengthwise laid it alternating right next to the lobster you know it's nice and snug get to know each other alternating randomized dots of scallion emulsification onto your plate and uh bonjour table service a nice tableside pour of your tom yum coconut cream i mean are we go we have french music going let's get the french music playing good lord a little line of furikake on the mushrooms some nice dots of chili oil on the tom yum cream and finally some fresh cilantro and baby thai basil leaves not gonna lie although this is a bit of a way a ways from a tom yum it has the essence of its soul in there and it looks ridiculous so let's taste test this and see what we think of both mr traditional and mr fancy wow this took a lot longer than i thought it was gonna take this whole process including the non-prick should take you a grand total of maybe one to two hours maximum but if you go to the store four times then it will take a very long time so don't do that all right we have two different variations a little spicy was it worth it yes or no yes the answer is always yes it's perfectly balanced you've got salty acid sweetness all three the trifecta you've seen my tomka guide a long time ago tom yum very yummy for your little baby tummy now the fine dining version wow why did we do this i don't know i wouldn't wanted to see if we could do it and it was actually shockingly easy green onion puree a little bit of coconut milk and lobster lettuce you're gonna pay 40 for this i can tell you right now that is not what i paid for it the prawn is almost like a bridge between shrimp and lobster lobsters over here shrimp is like down here but then in between you have this prawn now this is all the way there we maximized it could have put caviar in this the purple should have ice cold just like i like it this has been sitting for a while but i will say the lobster's cooked perfectly it's got that brown butter a little bit of a toast to it right it's elevated it's not quite just sweet lobster flesh i feel like this is more tonka guy almost i know nobody's gonna make this version i just wanted to prove that you could elevate it but at the end of the day you should make this one you've never had a tom yum or a tonka guy this is the place that you start please do not skip any steps do not go to the store and buy your own non-prick pal all right you're gonna make your own because you're gonna have this much left over and you know what you can do with this this is like a portal of flavor into any avenue you could ever want to go don't you want the little wizard of oz flavor portal it's right here see i can see them in there wow i'm not going to try to convince anyone to do anything today all right but a long day we all want to go home so with all that being said uh you want to know what else has good soup b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our tom yum and it came out beautifully the fancy one wasn't exactly a tom yum right it was something of its own but i don't think that's necessarily a bad thing because it still had that essence of tom yum it had the flavor of it there and it had the mentality of it i do want to clarify one major thing about this recipe if you are going to make tom yum ever whether you make your own fish stock or shrimp stock that's up to you but the nom prick is absolutely essential i would say that is the number one thing you should be making here today brother all right learn you something and make the got dang nam prick this is almost more of a recipe for non-prick pal than it is for tom yum although it will make the greatest tom yum of your life so the choice is yours but if you

Get My Cookbook: http://bit....",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, the other day i heard someone say oh my god onion has the best pretzels that's what's brought us here today [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so pretzels we've done pretzels before so it's not like a newfangled thing i have two different recipes and we're gonna be using the one from my cookbook and by the way if you've gotten your book please be sure to leave a review they mean a lot i love reading them but the point that i want to make is people have the wrong idea about pretzels unless you live in germany and you're used to it right germans homies all right you don't have to flex on us not everyone is as lucky as you just kidding i don't believe in luck i believe in hard work so with all that said let's make this shall we yeah woo in order to get to any ants for some reason they're only in malls which i didn't realize until now we're at the galleria come on over i don't like this i hate going to the mall break your arm to get it oh there's a video camera all right we're pulling out to uh the auntie of anne's i'll do two salted pretzels okay we've got this we need to do the three-point rating system so first off the little kiosk set up pretty bad i'm gonna give that probably a two point three six seven eight four five two point two is that possible out of one billion next thing the menu pretty basic it's as expected so we'll give it a five out of ten that's fair right here's a cinnamon sugar pretzel and here's a salt pretzel service i'm gonna give that a zero out of five thousand they didn't really seem very present but how can you blame them right they're serving pretzels all day let's just go eat this and this is not gonna be good oh the adventure continues not only am i wearing my swimming trunks right now because i forgot to do laundry the sticker they gave me to get out of here i have no idea where i put it so we're either locked in here or we're going to jail all right vikram how do you think you'll do in jail so let's see lost ticket oh there's an option lost ticket per day it doesn't specify okay here we go touch circle if lost is that it that's not terrible 20 bucks business card you can blame onto your hands so we've got the bag this bag is like waxed i guess it's actually kind of a good idea now that i think about it because then it keeps it from grease getting out right that's a plus wow that smells horrible what is that all right number one what happened does that look the same this looks like the anemic version that was forgotten at the hospital next cinnamon sugar this looks a lot better they reserved the good pretzel for this one this is what has the smell it's not the pretzel it's the fake butter oh it decided to depart from its original body form oh so this is better but it has the artificial butter flavor what's wrong kendrick is covering his ears from this here i'll take another bite and try to be nicer okay the sugar tastes good but everything else about this is trash we can do far better welcome back better right so we'll be using the recipe from my cookbook not the full recipe but the essence of it i just know it's gonna whoop on this here poopy oni anne's uh and don't get the wrong idea here pal there's over 100 recipes of pure new york times bestseller in this book and the link is in the got dang description now moving on to the dough in a large bowl add 2 cups or 500 milliliters of water let's run 100 degrees fahrenheit then add three and a quarter teaspoon or 14 grams of instant yeast begin whisking that and then whisk in a third cup or 72 grams of light brown sugar whisk until everything's dissolved and let that sit at room temp for about five minutes then in a separate bowl add five and a half cups or 825 grams of all-purpose flour and 1 teaspoon or 6 grams of fine sea salt we scald it together until thoroughly combined and then back to our yeasty juices whisk in a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of neutral tasting oil then stir in your flour mixture gradually begin mixing that by hand and then knead that for about 5 minutes or until relatively smooth okay it might be a little sticky and that's totally fine so take a sip of water and relax now shoot that bad boy into a ball grease a large bowl plop your chunky little man in there cover with greased plastic wrap and give it some sort of a personality yeah uh sure let that rise at room temp for one and a half hours or until doubled in while the bad boy's rising let's get our most important element to our pretzel ready this is not optional sorry if you want pretzels you must do this you're gonna need a highly diluted lye water bath what isn't lie bad for you well yes and no the way it's used here is relatively harmless because it's in low concentrations although it must be handled with care please be careful because papa loves you and papa wants to see you be healthy and win at life so be sure to acquire food grade lie link in the description for what i used and then simply get yourself 1 000 grams exactly of filtered water and carefully whisk in 30 grams of food grade lye until fully dissolved be careful not to splash yourself on the skin or any wooden or granite countertops with this stuff because it will discolor place that to the side somewhere safe remember this stuff is dangerous if it touches the skin so you've been warned liability is on you now assuming your pretzels have risen beautifully it's time to shape punch every last living breath out of your little man dump it out onto the counter and break down into 12 to 14 even pieces take each of those pieces and roll into tightly taught balls you know many great things start with balls now let your balls rest for 10 minutes covered and once your balls have rested using both your hands roll that ball out into a very long rod try to get it as long as you can while applying more pressure to the ends to get pointing tips and once it's about 13 to 14 inches long and it won't stretch anymore bring the ends together twirl them together once and bring them back down to the center of the rod to create a pretzel shape once you have all your pretzels it's the moment of truth to dip these in lie you must be very cautious pop on some powderless gloves and gently dip a pretzel into the lye bath let it soak for a few seconds then carefully transfer it onto a silpat lined baking sheet now for salted pretzels at this point you would hit them generously with flaky sea salt or if you want to be fancy smoked flaky salt and for the cinnamon ones well just leave your canvas blank no egg wash or nothing the lie coating will handle everything for you now pop that bad boy in an oven set to 450 fahrenheit for 10 to 15 minutes or until beautifully puffed unbelievably crusty deep burnished pretzels emerge just get a nice gentle brushing of some melted unsalted butter being careful not to knock off any flakes and just let those rest until warm and dig in while fresh from the oven for the cinnamon sugar it's unbelievably easy get a medium sized bowl add three quarters of a cup or 155 grams of granulated sugar a quarter cup or 55 grams of dark brown sugar and two and a half teaspoons or seven grams of ground cinnamon give that some whiskey business only to realize your brown sugar was clumpy and gross you had to sift it out but you shouldn't have to do that assuming it's fresh lessons then get yourself one cup or 225 grams of melted salted butter not unsalted dunk your pretzel completely in that melted butter like really fully coat that thigh then quickly toss in a bowl of your cinnamon sugar until completely coated and just take a look at this thing it's like a diamond crusted pretzel now we have two utterly impeccable pretzels now just by looking at this tragedy next to mine we might as well call this a dub but we must first verify with a taste test you sit here and tell me this looks better shut up good lord the best way i can describe this is everything you could ever want in a pretzel texturally flavor-wise in your entire life moving on to the next the uh cinnamon sugar i'm literally trying to keep saliva from falling in my mouth it was like right at my lip like oh hello oh my god masala spice more like mommy there is no comparison between these two double time knocked it out of the park the sweetness is balanced it's actually spicy the other one doesn't just taste like straight sugar real butter it's fragrant the texture obviously the same qualities of this pretzel but sensuous er kendrick please i need you hey buddy how you doing hi i'm all right numero uno that was so loud my ears oh wow number two number one or number two which was your preference number one number two was a little too chewy lack of a crusty there wasn't a lot of flavor it was just kind of bready and like wait are you talking about salt tell me you don't like audience that much no that's not what i'm saying i'm betraying my auntie nest oh my god don't buy my hands that's number one number got dang two oh my god challenge number two god number two is so good i'm sorry auntie the texture is great it's fluffy in the middle it's thick look at the difference of the crumb it's got like lift the choice is yours uh i would say gg but this was like an onslaught i carried this anyway if you want your mouth to feel good make this recipe you want to know what else is full of glossy twisty rods of dough b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our auntie anne's pretzels really all i did was make a proper pretzel what was really exciting about this learning that you can use a simple technique to make pretzels that's all it really is just take the time that it requires which is not that much and mostly just waiting for it to rise you're gonna go to the mall for four and a half hours to decide that you're not going to get 95 of the things that you're looking at just to order this crappy pretzel when you could just spend an hour and a half or two at home making the best pretzels of your life and kicking back relaxing watching a little netflix or something having a good old time getting some r r it's good for your body right and in all honesty the cinnamon sugar took the show it just did but with all that said if you enjoyed

dinner and that is what this is going to be about we have a clock there it is we have four hours to make a thanksgiving meal for the whole family this is enough to make for 10 people but you can obviously scale it up and it won't really increase the time whatsoever if you need to so if you found yourself on this video in urgent need of help you came to the right place the last thing i want to say is this is not your perfect oh i have to have my perfect little side fish to have every year we're on a ticking clock folks okay the goal is to move fast make something quickly last second and yet simultaneously unforgettably delicious this is a last minute thanksgiving dinner let's begin okay the clock is ticking and we've got major items to make so let's do this in an order that saves us the most time the turkey is a big bottleneck so we're gonna spatchcock it to cook it faster no more three-hour turkeys this way but hold your horses if you serve with your turkey you've now inundated the oven and i'm just gonna assume that you can only do one item in the oven at a time so instead let's begin with the stuffing get yourself one to two large loaves of brioche bread one of their relatively large and two if they're on the small side cut that into one inch cubes split on a baking sheet pop it into an oven set to 350 fahrenheit and bake tossing occasionally for about 10 to 15 minutes or until dry and toasty they might still be a tiny bit soft on the inside but look it's fine the pierce will say oh it's a no-no but those that are revolutionary don't abide by the rule makers anyway spray a 9x13 baking pan with vegetable oil and toss in your bread in a saucepan artfully toss in three quarters of a cup or 160 grams of unsalted butter set the heat to medium and let that melt until uh melted in case you might have guessed then add in one rough chopped yellow onion three ribs of celery rough chopped season a taste of salt stir and let that sweat stirring occasionally until softened about three to four minutes then add one tablespoon of dried oregano or oregano of your english sorry that was uh rude let that cook for one minute in a separate bowl add two large eggs and a splash of your chicken stock which the total amount of stock you're going to need is 2 cups or 420 milliliters whisk until thoroughly combined then add the rest of that chicken stock to your sweating veg cut the heat and then 2 tablespoons or 4 grams of fresh chopped sage now pour your egg mixture evenly across your bread and your stock and veg mixture give it a like toss hit it with flaky salt and spank yourself because it's only been a few minutes and we're ready for the oven cover that with foil pop it in the oven set the 350 fahrenheit for 25 minutes then uncover it and bake for 25 to 30 more minutes or until completely set and crisp on top now look we're not just gonna stand here twiddling our thumbs and dancing around the kitchen while that's baking we need to move on to our next project let's do mashed potatoes an easy next step get yourself three and a half pounds or one and a half kilograms of russet potatoes take their cheeky little jackets off rough chop and place in a pot of water and bring to a boil let those boil until just barely fork tender about eight minutes while those are boiling in a small sauce pot and look how cute this one is i love it i just want to kiss it okay enough love we need to speed up add in three quarters of a cup or 168 grams of unsalted butter half a cup or 120 milliliters of whole milk poop that under the stove over medium heat until hot hot monster my little beer now drain those titers pop them into a bowl mash with a hand masher move it to a larger bowl because the original bowl you picked was too small and once those are as smooth as you can get them add in your buttery mommy milky mixture stir together until evenly incorporated then half a cup or 130 grams of creme fraiche season a taste with salt have a bunch of thinly sliced chives fold together until completely combined and those are your lovely maish titers please i am begging you season these with salt to the absolute max potatoes can take a lot of salt there aren't many more culinary injustices comparable to an undersalted mashed potato now wrap that up and keep it warm at this point your stuffing is probably still going so let's hurry and make a quick cranberry sauce you're doing great all right just breathe in and out papa's got you cranberry sauce is dummy easy in a medium saucepan add 12 ounces or 340 grams of fresh or frozen cranberries one and a quarter cup or 300 grams of granulated sugar half a cup or 110 grams of orange juice a quarter cup or 60 grams of yuzu vinegar or lemon juice oh and of course two nice pieces of orange zest peeled off with a peeler avoiding any white pith stick gross word pith pop that on your stove set over medium high and bring that to a boil and let it bubble away until half reduced in syrupy but still has a little bit of liquid left in it like this about five to eight minutes pop that bad boy into a blender like literally all of it including the orange zest and blend that on high until it's as smooth as a lamborghini alcantara roofliner pass that through find mesh sieve and you have a beautifully glossy perfect [Music] little baby okay now at this point your stuffing should be done pull that bad boy out of the oven and look at that ready to be eaten except we're not gonna eat it so lightly tent that and place it aside to be rewarded for serving now for the turkey we already talked about how spatchcocking all right get used to the word a lot of people get uncomfortable with this all right we're gonna say it together spatchcock it's one word spatchcocking don't be weird about it this is the key to the fastest cooked juiciest whole turkey humanly possible well aside from maybe if you sous-vide it now get yourself a nice turkey this one's about eight and a half pounds or 3.8 kilograms give it some love oof wow very nice once you've winded and dined your turkey get some kitchen shears cut along both sides of the spine and remove it entirely normally we'd use this for the gravy but uh we're on a time crunch alright pop it in the freezer obviously wrapped up flip the bird so the open back faces down press down hard on the breast excuse me madame until it cracks and lays flat cover a baking sheet with foil in line with a wire rack pop your turkey onto that give it a nice rub you know a little massage it's had a long day you know it's got a lot of work to do later work those kinks out with some softened unsalted butter or olive oil you know get a little bit of the butter under the skin too why not then underneath the turkey add two heads of garlic cut in half in an array of any fresh herbs that you like i've got fresh rosemary and sage give it an additional coating with a glug or two of olive oil give it another little machage season generously with salt you know get a little under its skin if you can not with hateful words but you know by getting up in there pop that into an oven set to 450 fahrenheit for 20 minutes then lower the temp to 400 and roast for 15 to 20 more minutes reaches at least 160 fahrenheit yes 160 it will coast the rest of the way to 165 if you're worried about it then do 165. now while that's roasting what we're gonna do twiddle our thumbs huh go preemptively set up your holiday get up in your house wrong first we're gonna make our veggies in a large saute pan heat just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan set over medium high once the oil is shimmering and adding two bunches of green onion cut into three quarter inch segments and sear tossing occasionally for three minutes or until you get some light charring and they're cooked through reduce the heat to medium low and add four cloves of garlic thinly slice two thai chilies then sliced and two shallots you guessed it thin sliced when i say thin by the way i mean like push yourself please make it thin right not half an inch thick thin let that sweat until the veg is completely soft about four to five minutes then add in three cups or 300 grams of green beans cut in half and let that cook just until the beans are barely beginning to soften want that nice snap pop in my mouth place all that into a bowl then heat another couple tablespoons of vegetable oil or olive oil in the pan until ripping hot add in a quarter head of cabbage thinly sliced and sear tossing occasionally until you get some light coloration and it's beginning to wilt but still has crunch about one to two minutes place that in your bowl along with two green onions thinly sliced the zest of one lemon some crispy shallots if you have them a generous glug of extra virgin olive oil salt and pepper to taste and lemon juice to taste toss together and you have one of the best hot salads you've ever seen it's basically an upscale version of green bean casserole except like a break away from the years and years of green bean thanksgiving monotony and don't go whining in the comments oh i have to have my green bean casserole you know what you got four hours pal what do you want now for the gravy we don't have time to make chicken stock cool i've got to work around and this is one of the very very very few times i will ever give you a solution to the horrifying terrible pre-made chicken stock that's at the store but it's a little thing i like to call shiradashi and don't you dare try and use this method against me later on say oh josh i didn't have chicken stock but i did this don't you do it in a medium saucepan add a quarter cup or 44 grams of unsalted butter and a quarter cup or 35 grams of duck fat if you don't have duck fat you can use all butter heat it over medium heat until completely melted then add half a cup or 75 grams of all-purpose flour whisk together till combined and allow that to cook stirring often for about 45 seconds then add in three to quarter cup or 770 milliliters of probably poopy chicken stock along with half a cup or 120 milliliters of sure dashi also known as papa's crutch let that heat stirring often until thickened to your liking optionally if you want some further depth of flavor feel free to add a sprig or two of fresh rosemary lightly bruised left to steep in your hot yummy papa gravy for about five minutes okay everything's ready it's the home stretch and the turkey's about to knock it out the park pull it out of the oven and  it maybe you don't have time to let it rest more than 10 minutes that's totally fine it's gonna be a little juice everywhere all right it might dry out a little bit but you know what goddang did it get yourself a nice sharp knife cover up beautifully remove the legs separate the thigh and the drumstick on both of them remove each of the breasts daintily of course slice the breast on a bias leaving that quiff skin intact as best as you can remove the bone from the thigh meat chop it into bite size pieces and lay atop beautifully placed herbs on a serving platter then just assemble all your beautiful sides toppings garnishes butter soaked mashed potatoes and as i stated before you can scale these recipes up or down depending on how many people you're gonna be serving and it won't have much of a bearing on prep time at all especially if you get an additional protein like ham that's already pre-cooked now we check the clock and cut you out look at that brother four hours in we have a thanksgiving meal now let's taste test and see if we were able to maybe make it even a little better than the typical thanksgiving dinner made 90 faster than all of them right look away bikram a little bit of stuffing a little bit of veg a little bit of taters boom put a little divot in there a little bit of turkey a little bit of breast maybe a little bit of thigh you can't forget i'm gonna quinnell this and then last but certainly not least a beautiful gravy right in the middle oh good lord this is a very light thanksgiving me a plate i would go way harder than this but we have a full scale meal plenty more than enough uh unfortunately there were supposed to be people coming um none of them showed up but the crew's here and they're gonna be eating today shout out to them immediately damn the mashed potatoes and the gravy absolutely busting is that shiradashi gravy that is how you fortify a chicken stock at the store you throw in a couple squirts get yourself a good old grave right there onto the turkey spatchcocked it busting i'll be honest with you i left it in there a little too long all right which is ironic because we were in a hurry this was so easy that we were just sitting there but it was like oh wait this was undeniably easy stuffing this is how i like my stuffing the little tiny little pieces of cornbread that have been sitting in the bag dried up for years that's what you want damn the salad's really good whether you're cooking your thanksgiving dinner last second or not this salad needs to be on your plate period end of story i'm not explaining why try it for yourself you'll find out why my last thing i want to say cranberry sauce done over cancel i'm cancelling canned cranberry sauce enough is enough this takes how long does this take vikram like eight minutes eight minutes to make your own cranberry sauce and blend it have it look beautifully glossy like this tastes ten thousand times better and we were under time constraint the whole crew is eating it's been done in less than four hours what more could you possibly want if you have a last-minute thanksgiving dinner that's coming up right now and you're on this video and you're yourself well don't you worry [Music] and just do the got dang work you wanna know what else has big juicy dripping thighs and crisp skin b-roll all right guys and that is it look this was a massive w and i hope it was both entertaining and helpful for you in the future or maybe right now if you're watching the video and you're freaking out big breath in and big breath out this is one of those dinners that everyone thinks you need massive massive massive amounts of prep in advance to get it done and it's just not true that's the whole point of this video now granted prepping is helpful and ideal but sometimes you just gotta crank it

...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, you want kung pao chicken but if you want the good stuff you're paying 15 20 when you could have it for this right here and it'd be even better that's much cheaper [Music] so so what's everyone thankful for this year well i'm thankful for my friends and family i'm thankful for this decadent meal i am thankful for the homies well i'm thankful for being a number one new york times bestseller and it's also number one on amazon and 40 off on there the link is in the description who are you talking to anyways let's eat [Music] so kung pao chicken is it traditional is it not traditional kind of actually yes every time i see bell peppers in a kung pao chicken my first thought is immediately like it's not exactly traditional to do that really just doesn't exist it should be spicy it should be nice and sweet but more specifically it should be cooked in a wok they're not expensive to get so you can have a traditional one at home with high quality ingredients that's just as good as those fifteen twenty dollar ones just simply by making it yourself that's what bud cheaper is all about we've obviously done it a million [ __ ] times on here trying to learn you something with all that being said let's make this shall we a proper stir-fry is easy and all of that happens in one place excluding your absolutely perfectly washed and then cooked rice of choice of course dancing to the song of our rice cooker deity let's first marinate our chicken snack yourself 2 pounds or 905 grams of chicken thighs which should be boneless skinless and somehow having the same colorway as the palms of my hands cut those bad boys into 1 inch or slightly smaller bite size pieces and pop them in a medium sized bowl to the chicken you'll add one teaspoon or four grams of corn starch and optionally a pinch of ground white pepper test together to coat then add two tablespoons or 36 grams of soy sauce and one tablespoon or 10 grams of shaoxing wine or cheap dry sherry or leave it out entirely it's fine give it a nice mix to the point of auditory discomfort you know what let's make that a visual discomfort as well cover that and place it to the side for 10 minutes or into the fridge overnight now for our sauce brother there are many substitutions here if you don't have all these but it will slightly affect the flavor get a small bowl and add two enough tablespoons or 33 grams of granulated sugar 2 teaspoons or 10 grams of corn starch a quarter cup or 70 grams of soy sauce i did a mix of half dark and half regular but you can just stick with regular three tablespoons are 43 grams of chinese black vinegar a quarter cup or 58 grams of chicken stock and optionally two and a half tablespoons or 31 grams of shaoxing wine oh and three tablespoons or 36 grams of water who sculpted together and you have a of flavor with a couple of things that are really yummy but not required for the sake of price okay walk time oh josh this is but cheaper what if we don't have a wok well three things shut up number two the wok is probably the most versatile cooking pan for its price that i can possibly imagine and third if you don't have one you could just use a large pan and simply understand that you will get no okay which is fine i guess not really but you get some lenience because this is a right so be sure your wok is fully seasoned and then pay attention carefully because this goes by pretty quick at 3.5 tablespoons or 53 grams of vegetable oil you want kind of a pool going on here heat that over medium high on a very large stockpot burner or on high on a regular burner then once that's hot hot call the gap dang police add in a quarter cup or 48 grams of raw peanuts and stir fry those bad boys until golden brown then remove in the words of nico leonard look at her now add eight dried chilies you could do arbol or tianjin stir fry those until fragrant and crisp about 20 seconds then remove those guys now crank the heat on that bang once it's so hot you might as well spank your horse and run on home add in your chicken in batches and stir fry for three to four minutes each batch or until you get some nice browning and your chicken is fully cooked don't worry too much about overcooking that's why we went with thighs you know i go with thighs because i know someone is going to try and make a mistake here and i refuse to allow it now remove all your chicken and add three quarters of a bunch of green onions cut into three quarter inch segments stir fry on high for 20 seconds to lightly charred and wilted then add 1 inch knob of ginger minced stir fry for 10 seconds then add 8 cloves of minced garlic and stir fry that stuff until the garlic is cooked and begins to toast now optionally you can stir in a pinch of ground sichuan peppercorn but that's completely optional and it is totally fine if you leave it out now add your chicken back followed by your chilies and peanuts and begin stir frying catch the little flame you know ain't nothing wrong with that do that for about 30 seconds then add your kung pao sauce and continue to stir fry until everything is beautifully thickened into a lovely glossy glaze you should be able to see your reflection in the chicken now immediately cut off the heat place it in a serving bowl top with crushed peanuts and thinly sliced green and that is a lovely kung pao chicken coming in at this beautiful price per serving right here and this isn't just some takeout either this is an undeniably deeply flavored kung pao chicken that's going to take you on a journey while keeping your wallet happier than some screeching kid with a new xbox now let's see if this price down kung pao chicken tastes like the real thing i mean look at this look at it as soon as you see that gloss it's like shining it's like my forehead when i'm out in the sun too long and it's not even sweat anymore you get what i'm going for right good lord i'll take my boots off and slap my knee that is so good you're getting each and every note that melds together beautifully the chicken isn't dry all right we went with thighs i love juicy thighs in my mouth all right the chicken flavor really comes out you can taste the peanut because it was toasted in the oil the chilis come through it's actually not that spicy depending on the chilies that you use these are more mild this is a perfect kung pao chicken and it's for this price right there if that ain't a goddamn butt cheap it'll make your pants fly right off your body i don't know what will now you going out there and you get that walk you go do this dang thing i guess it wouldn't be a bud cheaper if you got the wok so don't get the wok just use it in a pan you got a big pan thank you for coming don't take that the wrong way you want to know what else fills you with the hot breath of papa's walk b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we had our kung pao chicken look i know we didn't really include the rice with the rice it cost this much okay it's not that much of a difference my only point that i want to make to you and it's always the same thing right when you make things at home it is naturally going to be cheaper it is that easy to make a butt cheaper episode but it's more than that it's about simplifying things and focusing on technique everybody skips that these days they're just throwing a little canned sauce you shake it up in the wok and oh it's done but it sucks everybody's forgotten what's good it's kind of feeling a little sad so um i could do a little dance and with all that said if you enjoyed this video you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time stop accepting less than what you deserve oh shut it off fake room [Music]

Or at least it's special to me. Homemade Chilaquiles 2 ways, Verde and Rojo. Change your brunch game forever....",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, i'm tired of the monotony of breakfast eggs and bacon eggs and bacon every day enough is enough this should be the new breakfast staple [Music] it's november which means it's christmas time aha merry christmas it might be a little bit premature but you know what's not premature buy my cookbook which is 40 off on amazon and the link is in the description i will be signing more books so if you don't have your copy yet the time is now go get it this is a perfect gift don't you think i think it's time that we finish putting up the light sweetie just so that everybody can see the advertisement [Music] merry christmas okay so today we were making chilaquiles two different versions a rojo and a verde if you don't know what chilochilis are it's essentially tortillas that are fried aka tortilla chips and then simmered in a salsa or a sauce put on a plate you got eggs lots of cheese sometimes bacon it's up to you it's a beautiful choose your own adventure breakfast that has multiple layers multiple textures why is it everyone not eating this this is also like the perfect brunch item so without that being said let's make this shall we wow you know what time it is pal it is officially chilaquiles time dude it's one of the greatest breakfasts of all time and i've got two for you a rojo and a verde right so let's begin with the classic rojo version before you get all fancy in your pants let's make a jalapeno crema get yourself two nice jalapenos using a kitchen torch or the flame of your stovetop char them all over until it's charred edge to edge like this pop it into a bowl and cover with foil or plastic wrap and allow to steam for 5 minutes after that take it out and then using a paper towel wipe off any black jar until they look like this remove the stems but keep the seeds toss whole into a blender along with four cloves of garlic take a second to show the whole team how sharp your knives are to inflate your ego then add a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of water to your blender blend that bad boy on high until it's as smooth as possible then while constantly blending stream in three tablespoons or 68 grams of vegetable oil once that's creamy and smooth it's done now in a small bowl add a quarter cup or 52 grams of sour cream and half a cup or 120 grams of mayonnaise add your jalapene mixture to your bowl mix together then switch to a bigger bowl then season that bad boy to taste with salt if needed and that's your jalapeno crema now for the actual rojo of course you can go and buy chips and add them to this but i can assure you they will go soggy much faster and won't have much flavor it's very easy to instead get yourself 14 yellow corn tortillas cut those into quarters to get wedges heat up a 7 quart pot filled halfway with vegetable oil to 350 fahrenheit and then add your tortilla wedges in batches and fry until completely crisp and golden brown pull them out and drain on a wire rack season immediately with kosher salt if you do not season them right after frying the salt won't stick and you won't feel papa's tender embrace for seasoning properly then just repeat that with all your tortilla wedges and well that's your tortilla chip now they're ready for your rojo get a large saute pan and add just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan heat to medium and add four guajillo chilies and three ancho chilis both of which have been stemmed and de-seeded let those toasts just slightly in the pan tossing occasionally then remove them and add in half a yellow onion diced two serranos sliced thin and five cloves of garlic rough chopped season taste with salt and saute until add your dried chilies back but a tablespoon of fresh oregano leaves along with one and a half cups or 335 grams of chicken stock in one 28 ounce can of crushed san marzano tomatoes stir that together leave the heat to medium and let that come to a simmer now you just need to simmer that bad boy for 10 to 12 minutes stirring occasionally until the chilies are extremely soft and tear easily it will naturally reduce which is good from there simply pick out all the rehydrated chilies place them in a blender pour all that liquid in the pan into the blender and blend that bad boy on high speed until as smooth as possible yet again drizzle a tablespoon or two of vegetable oil in there which will smooth it and gramify it pour that back into your pan place back on the stove over medium bring to a light simmer then once simmering add all of your chips you fried to the pan gently toss to coat completely and allow those to gently simmer for 8 to 10 minutes essentially you do want them to soften but you also want that slight crunchy chew to each bite not making tortilla porridge here okay so let's give it some body now we're ready to assemble normally you'll see fried eggs on this but i think we should go the poached route one because poached eggs are dope and two because it kind of feels like a brunch which is bone simply get yourself a medium sauce pot filled a little over halfway with water bring that up to a boil over medium high then immediately reduce the heat to medium low for a very very very gentle simmer crack an egg into a ramekin give that simmering water a splash of white distilled vinegar then get yourself a spoon start making circles in the center and gradually bring it to the exterior to make a beautiful whirlpool then immediately but gently lower and drop that egg just into the center of that whirlpool it'll naturally wrap around itself then just manage that temp so it doesn't start boiling or simmering aggressively and allow that to sit in there and poach for two to three minutes or until a beautiful runny inside but a cooked white emerges it should jiggle you know what i mean drink it on a paper towel and repeat for as many as you like although i think one to two poached eggs per plate is ideal now it's assembly time load up your plate with your rojo chilaquiles stack on two festively plump poached eggs drop on some willfully placed diced avocado add on as many generous dots of your jalapeno crema like some sort of chilaquile camouflage hit that with a generous sprinkling of cotija cheese and finally garnish with fresh cilantro leaves now that looks like something special because that runny yolk right there is about to make me do 10 hail marys and absolutely before we taste test let's make our verde on a baking sheet beautifully add on to serranos cut in half lengthwise two jalapenos also cut in half one pound or 450 grams of tomatillos also cut in half cut side down and half of one large sweet onion which has also been cut in half and then cut in half again to give you a nice quarter spray generously with cooking oil and pop that into the oven under the broiler set on high for three to five minutes or until out emerges a beautifully and artfully charred set of veggies pop all that into your blender now test it half a bunch of your fresh cilantro the juice of one lime and six cloves of peeled garlic letting that bad boy on high until smooth as possible pour out of your blender into a vessel or storage container season further with salt if needed and that's your tomatillo verde salsa my dude now get yourself four thicky wicky chicky thighs boneless and skinless sea cinna taste with whatever spice you like this is a homemade cajun creole spice from the gumbo video heat a medium sized pan with just enough oil coating the bottom over medium-high cedar chicken in one layer for three minutes flip and sear on the other side then pour in half cup of water top with foil lower the heat to medium low and let that simmer just until the chicken is fully cooked and a therma reads an internal temperature of 165 fahrenheit now pour all of that including its juices onto a small sheet tray shred with two forks and toss together in its own juices sweet bahama mama you know it's gonna be good now assembly is a little different and slightly simpler heat up a large 12-inch skillet with a small splash of oil add in half your chips which you fried yourself right right right heat them up and get them a little crisp so that they're hot then add half of your tomatillo salsa toss vigorously to coat add half your shredded chicken test to incorporate and then immediately plate it up no simmering for this one i want these extra claunchy now obviously that was half the batch to repeat with the other batch should you need more now pop that on a plate and to top this give it a nice squiggly line of sour cream a nice layer of pickled jalapenos and before you make any assumptions you best believe i made my own literally just one cup of vinegar and one and a half cups of water and one tablespoon of salt brought to a boil in a pan poured over quarter inch thick sliced jalapenos and left to sit at room temp bada bing bada boom pickly peanuts next stack on a fried egg or two a generous sprinkling of cotija or queso fresco and finally fresh chopped cilantro and that leaves us with our second of two incredibly iconic looking and arguably perfectly tasting chili quilis it's life's ultimate choose your own adventure brunch and or breakfast so i think that it's time that we taste test and see how close we got to authenticity if it's even good in the god dang first place i do want to know that ulysses wanted to tell me that his grandma and his dad gave me the shout out for these so y'all better take some dang notes homies these are two different kinds of chilaquiles we got rojo and we have a perfect verde now don't talk to me about pronunciation right i'm not doing it i just have two white of a voice i can't i'm sorry perfectly poached eggs suck it and these beautiful chilaquiles in the rojo sauce good lord this tastes like a cowboy sunday afternoon they're crisp because we fried them ourselves they're thick they have crunch and yet chew at the same time next one mustache with the green chili lace we went with another cooking method so it still has a little bit of crunch turn off the game anyway this is a completely different eating experience you got more crunch little more acidity it's lighter and yet there's a little bit of a creaminess you got the chicken in there this is like a little less breakfasty and a little more lunch time or lunch time as i've said many times the choice is yours make whatever the hell you want to make but you get out there nonetheless you make some chilaquiles just don't forget your goddamn cowboy hat yeah i don't have anywhere to go you want to know what else has big bulbous oozing goodness all over your plate b-roll [Music] alright guys and that is it so we made our chilaquiles they came out beautifully i mean look at this wow i want to put that in me uh in my mouth inside of my mouth don't you see the beauty of putting a poached egg on chilaquiles suddenly a immediately makes it feel like brunch b looks dope and c is gemmy you can obviously see how this is interchangeable you could put different meats on it you can cook the eggs differently you could also just completely eliminate the eggs you don't have to have eggs on chili helix but if you wanted to feel breakfast if you wanted to feel brunch then you'll make it this way so with all that being said

this shall we i we pulled up to a gas station burger king i just can't bring myself to it i want to make it out of this alive so we're going to go to a different one this is like the fast food strip of houston right here home of the whopper there's one person here pretty sure it's the employee that works here all right here we go i guess okay here are the people all right i'll give them my apologies does burger king have their own waste service organic we're getting here to save the planet welcome back to the three-point rating system where we rate with three points number one how did they do on the appearance well it looks clean it's also boring and i hate that they put the letter home of the whopper so i'll give them a 2.3 star sign out of a billion the menu i can see it from here what is that shaking they were in a boardroom meeting and desperate chicken king chicken king then the ceo's like i don't know how burger king came around but it's almost like there's all these other fast food joints and then burger king was just kind of like i sell the exact same thing we'll give their menu a three out of ten and a half service well we haven't gotten there yet but i can say that it's significantly slower i've mentioned multiple times in mcdonald's whatever we go it's like boom you're in here here's your food and you're basically driving and they throw it at you and it lands in your mouth that's how fast it is we're still in line so service so far not looking good what do i do with this red light is it do i have should i back up you start watching my car i'm like no stop hi uh can i just get two um uh jeez two uh two double whoppers with cheese thank you 50 damn thank you so much all right so we have the bag uh this has already been a long drive through bye we'll see you in the house so we've got it looks like they finally took my advice i really don't like modern art on burger and or fast food bags just call yourself what you are disgusting these are bigger than i expected i don't want to eat that why is it so stinky so we got an extra patty what are these follicles this smells exactly like a cafeteria burger remember when you're in school and you pull up you're like i'll have a burger and then you just get this you get this can i get a smell test on this please tell me what kind of memories come back mustard who the put the lettuce on this this is what it's supposed to be this is egregious not even mcdonald's will go this far i'm sorry i'm like stalling because i don't want to eat this this is really bad if i can't out do this burger i will go work for burger king oh it's fine it's in a better place we've done many burgers on this series so how do we make this one different don't you worry brother i got some things up my sleeve now first up is our buns look i really want to change this up i want to try to make these buns so soft so irresistibly chewy but it's like it came out of a factory much like all the other fast food buns actually literally do so we're gonna use the multipurpose bundo that's in my cookbook as a base and add some fancy science stuff to it but if you don't have my book first off ouch link in the description but i'll tell you it anyway here it is when you look at this recipe it has a tang zong in it so first off toss that out the window we're not gonna be using that in this recipe instead start off with the listed half a cup or 125 milliliters of whole milk and this time half a cup plus three tablespoons or grand total of 170 milliliters of water so this dough is slightly more wet mmm peppa's what dough to that you whisk in two and a half teaspoons or nine grams of specifically bread machine yeast instead of instant yeast bread machine yeast has dough conditioners that'll help soften the dough up whisk it together till dissolved then add that to the bottom of your stand mixer along with one egg and one egg yolk whisked begin mixing that on medium-low speed then in a separate bowl with three and a half cups or 525 grams of bread flour add a third cup or 60 grams of granulated sugar and 4 grams of amylase amylase amylase hold up josh what intarnation is that amylase enzyme is well an enzyme let's use this yet another dough conditioner now that term sounds so weird the point is that it's going to help get you that commercial bread softness the texture that you want and it'll last a little longer by helping convert starches to sugars etc fun fact it's the same stuff that your mouth naturally produces gross anyway whisk that together and add that to your stand mixer while it's running about a quarter cup at a time until all of your flour is added then after mixing for about one to two minutes and you have sort of a smooth dough starting to form at three and a half tablespoons or 50 grams of unsalted softened butter let that incorporate into the dough and allow it to mix and knead on low until completely smooth and pulling from the sides of the bowl about 10 minutes then pull it out give it a few slap and folds on a work surface roll it into a ball and place in a greased bowl so here's what we changed we added more hydration we added dough conditioners we added sugar and we added more butter well it's like we're in a commercial factory or something now it's like i'm just over in the corner clanging and banging on some big old hobart mixers anyway cover that with plastic wrap give it a name worthy of holding the bk whopper title and let that rise for 45 minutes at room temperature then pop it into the fridge for another one and a half hours to slow proof obviously during that time you should prep all of your other ingredients but thanks to movie magic it's done rising break that down into 90 gram pieces which will get you about eight to ten pieces of dough get yourself a baking sheet spray with cooking spray lay down a sheet of parchment and then lay out three and a half inch english muffin ring molds now i actually didn't have any so i made my own with foil it's a wee bit giant key but you know what i think they look pretty good you can call me engineer josh all right i engineer things spray those guys with cooking spray roll your pieces of dough into top balls and then place them right in the center of your ring molds spray their tops with oil then using a flat bottomed cup press them down lightly to form fat discs lightly tent with plastic wrap and proof for one hour at room temperature take the plastic wrap off and to egg wash them mix together one to two eggs with one and a half tablespoons of water and instead of brushing it on this time we're gonna add it to a spray bottle and give all of your pieces of dough a nice even coating you like that method why use a brush then you can just shower them you know sort of like a golden shower uh wait a minute that's going a direction i don't want to just spray them once sprayed sprinkle the sesame seeds and pop into an oven set to 375 fahrenheit for 14 minutes or until a beautifully golden brown evenly colored bun emerges let those cool slightly and carefully remove the ring molds yes it's hot give them a light brushing with melted butter probably would have been smart to take my own vice and give them a nice golden uh spritz with melted butter but hey you live and you learn optionally add some flaky salt and your buns are done let those cool completely and simply marvel at buns that are as soft as a mass manufactured buns but you know with actual flavor i mean look at the way that this squishes i have to look away as to avoid having old-fashioned puss all right during all that waiting time while you're making these buns you should make the other elements of the burger so let's start with dill pickles you best believe we're making our own which is very easy so wipe your little tears papa's here did you drink water today sort of with a big old seedless cucumber cut off the ends and slice into quarter inch thick rounds pop that bad boy into a large one and a half quart jar or larger then in a medium sauce pot add two cups or 416 grams of water one and a half cups or 306 grams of white distilled vinegar 2 tablespoons or 19 grams of kosher salt a bay leaf crushed then in a nice net of cheesecloth add one tablespoon or nine grams of peppercorns one tablespoon or ten grams of mustard seeds two tablespoons or eight grams of coriander seeds and one tablespoon or eight grams of dill seed gather up the sides twist it to make a little sack tie off the top with kitchen twine and you have your sachet or a spice sack if you want to call it that pop that into your pickle liquid along with a small spoonful of turmeric spice bring them to a boil and immediately cut off the heat pour that hot liquid over your cux add in one bunch of dill and three or four cloves of garlic lightly crushed and let that sit until it comes to room temperature then once it's cooled you have pickles wow next up mayo you know burger king seems to really have a thing for mail so we're gonna make our own instead of using something that's been in a packet since 1946 in a medium-sized bowl add one egg yolk one tablespoon or eighteen grams of dijon mustard one teaspoon or five grams of sugar one clove of garlic grated salt to taste and the juice from one whole lemon whisk it together and then while constantly whisking you're gonna slowly add in one cup or 191 grams of vegetable oil using my technique to add it in an even stream but first you'll start drop by drop and then once it begins to emulsify increase that speed to a nice drizzle while constantly whisking until all of your oil is added if it's still not thick enough keep adding oil until it reaches this consistency right here once done place your meal in the fridge until needed one of the weirder elements of this burger is that ketchup is a key ingredient which i've not really been that much of a fan of doing that but you know what we gotta stay true to the bk version to treat my echoing cries in the night caused by this combo here's a spicy ketchup in a small bowl add three quarters of a cup or 215 grams of ketchup half a teaspoon or two grams of cayenne powder 1 tbsp or 8 grams of aleppo powder 1 teaspoon or 4 grams of garlic powder and 1 teaspoon or 5 grams of worcestershire sauce i think i pretty much nailed that pronunciation there whisk that together until thoroughly combined and that is your spicy ketchup of course next we have our vegetables tomato lettuce and onion the iceberg lettuce is self-explanatory but i recommend that you slice it as thinly as possible so you get some nice thin stacks rather than chunky poopy lettuce like burger king for the onyo the same goes except you're gonna slice it against the grain of the onion as thinly as you can to get beautiful sharp moon shaped julienne to calm the aggressiveness of the onion and allow its sweetness to shine pop that into a bowl with a wire rack on top and run water on it for about one to two minutes and then dry it off trust me this seems like a small step but it makes a massive difference in how much nicer the onions are both texturally and flavor-wise take notes bk as for the tomato you know how i feel slice it thin but not too thin about a third of an inch will do nicely and what do we always do season your tomato with kosher salt on both sides this is crucial if you don't season your tomatoes i will not come over and watch batman with you is that what you want now let those sit for a few minutes so the salt can penetrate the tomato now last but not least is our burger patty you can use any store-bought ground beef but i want a proper fat content so i'm going to use three quarters of a pound or 340 grams of boneless chuck roast and three-quarters of a pound or 340 grams of boneless short rib both of which are prime for that good marbling run that through a meat grinder for one pass through and then one more time for a second pass through so you get a finer and more emulsified grind then knead that together and you have a beautiful ground beef side note if you do have a stand mixer please do yourself a favor get this attachment the link is in the description it's not a sponsorship i just love this thing if you're not gonna grind it yourself just get one and a half pounds of 75 lean or fattier already ground beef now form that beef into one third pound patties yup one third wow so naughty mr culinary boy you're not gonna do a quarter pound be sure to make them slightly wider than your buns to account for shrinkage now i feel like burger king always advertise sort of like a charcoal grilled flavor so light up a charcoal grill or any grill for that matter have one hot side and one cold side then once that's hot slap your knee kick a snow globe that thing is hot spray with cooking oil season your patties generously with salt and pepper pop that onto the hot side press the small divot in the center of the patty then grill that for about two minutes or until you get some good color then flip hit it with more salt and pepper and grill on the other side for two to three more minutes move that to the cool side of the grill and repeat with all of your patties it's time homies assembly time get your factory level soft buns split them in half and toast them beautifully on both cut sides in a pan with butter oh good lord look at that and assemble in this exact order bottom bun a generous spreading of your mail i mean this stuff is insanely good and yes i'm a mayo advocate please stay away from me if you hate mayo add your juiciest fresh ground beef patty which have taken the liberty of melting a layer of american cheese on top then add a layer of sharp cheddar melt that bad boy with a torch or under a broiler it's sort of like a nice mix of highs and lows with the cheese here on top of that arrange your pickles to cook the whole patty a generous dollop of your spicy ketchup a decent stack of your thinly sliced washed one slice a layer of your shredded lettuce mail your top bun and then gently and artfully crown your magnificent king this might be one of the most beautiful burgers we've assembled on here that looks like something straight out of a cartoon yes hello is this the krusty krab thank you for picking up sorry to tell you this but you've been absolutely dunked on speaking of dunking on let's taste test this and see if we've truly defeated the whopper will you tell me which one you want you want this you woke up in the morning you're like oh it's lunch time and you said i want this you should be ashamed oh my god how do you think we did we won by a landslide period end of story i'm not even gonna explain it to you welcoming pono his first time oh you gotta you're out of frame buddy oh i read

in it we are in the new home of the whopper the only thing that i have to say about this burger and not mine but the burger king version is it's cringe it is cringe that is called burger king i cannot

Making crepes is easy. That's why we're making...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, gonna tell me american pancakes are your favorite when they're the least versatile breakfast food on the planet and not give the deserved respect to crepes the real swiss army knife [Music] okay so today we are making crepes three different ways and it doesn't end there there's many many ways you can go about it the main point i want to make is that they're so versatile but you want to know what else is versatile today's sponsor ghirardelli in one of our crepes we're going to be using ghirardelli baking chocolate chips which is going to fill it with its rich decadent chocolatey flavor with the holidays coming around the corner we should really only be focused on one thing and that is how it brings everyone together and what better way to do that than with chocolate right and also maybe uh these crepes you know now that i think about it right we're doing butt better so then ghirardelli is essentially making life a bite better if you want to learn more about ghirardelli or gear deli baking chocolate chips you can go to your local grocery store buy yourself a bag and find out brother moving on to the recipe in all honesty the ghirardelli chocolate chip version is actually my favorite out of the three we'll have crepe suzette the mexican hot chocolate spiced crepe and finally a savory crepe and that's where the beauty of a crepe comes in it has savory qualities just as much as it has dessert qualities that's what makes it beautiful you do anything with a crepe texturally it's exciting you can even make a crepe cake what an actual cake of crepes we're gonna we're not gonna do that today because it's really annoying but with all that being said let's make this shall we right so if you're gonna make crepes how in tarnation are gonna do that without any batter if you're buying store-bought pre-cooked crepes then i need you to immediately stop and check yourself into jail in a large bowl add one cup or 150 grams of all-purpose flour one and a half tablespoons or 25 grams of granulated sugar wait a minute josh that looks like a lot more than what you're saying here well you'd be correct i tripled the recipe here in order to make all three of these recipes but of course you would not or maybe you would anyway in a separate bowl add two eggs and one egg yolk we can pretend that that's what's in this bowl okay editors work your magic wow look at that incredible anyway whisk that together and slowly whisk in 1 tablespoon or 14 milliliters of vegetable oil then whisk in one cup or 240 milliliters of whole milk whisk the wet into the dry until clump free and homogeneous strain through a mesh strainer or chinois if you want it ultra smooth and that is your crepe batter now before we go into the variations here let's first talk about making a beautifully cooked crepe without the use of a crepe maker very easy get yourself a 10 inch non-stick skillet give it a spray with cooking oil heat it over medium heat until hot like the bahamas then add a third cup or 78 milliliters of your batter and immediately swirl and rotate the pan around to coat the entire surface and form it into an even large circle this might take you a try or two but don't be a little baby alright if the first one isn't perfect keep at it my child let that cook until the top is dry and the underside is just barely starting to get golden brown flip and let it cook for 15 more seconds then toss into a landing device like this baking sheet and repeat until all of your batter is used now this recipe works with one batch of any of the following iterations we've got a mexican hot chocolate hazelnut crepe crepe susette and finally a savory breakfast crepe now let's begin with the mexican hot chocolate hazelnut crepe with a little bit of a oh i don't know try [Music] first hazelnut filling get yourself half a pound or 225 grams of raw hazelnuts pop those into an oven set to 350 fahrenheit for eight to ten minutes or until deeply toasted and the skins are beginning to fall off let them cool for one minute then using a dish towel wipe off as much of the skins as possible by rubbing them together you know nothing better than a charming morning rubbing your nuts place your nuts to the side and cool to room temp once at room temp pop those puppies into a food processor and begin processing on high literally just let that thing run don't get impatient and stop it you know unless it cakes up on the side really there are only two good kinds of cake and one of those isn't in this recipe if you know what i mean once it's smooth pastified and warm while constantly processing add in a quarter cup or 45 grams of unmelted ghira deli semi-sweet chocolate chips let those process until completely smooth and emulsified with the nut butter then add 6 tablespoons or 80 grams of cocoa powder let that incorporate then add 1 cup or 205 grams of powdered sugar a spoonful at a time then once everything is incorporated drizzle in 2 tablespoons or 24 grams of vegetable oil or hazelnut oil and once that is beautifully smooth and velvety your chocolate hazelnut butter is done and i mean look at this it's like ribbons falling down from the great galaxy in the night sky above next is our cremon glaze which if i'm being honest is slightly runnier than a traditional one but that's the goal we're going for here separate out four egg yolks and place them in a small bowl along with a third cup or 70 grams of sugar mixed into them then in a small saucepan and half a cup 120 milliliters of heavy cream and half a cup or 120 milliliters of whole milk and the beans from one vanilla bean pot ah screw it put the whole pot in there why not heat that milky man until nice and steamy but not boiling pour in a splash of your hot liquid into your egg yolks mixing it in little by little until your egg mixture is nice and pour that back into your milky and let that heat over medium low stirring often until it thickens enough to hold a line like this strain that into a bowl sit over a nice bath and let that cool completely until it's nice and thick like me sorry really a lot of butt stuff today optionally pop that into a squirt bottle now last but not least is your mexican hot chocolate powder for sprinkling in a medium-sized bowl add a quarter cup or 55 grams of powdered sugar 2 and a half tablespoons or 40 grams of cocoa powder 1 tablespoon or 12 grams of ground cinnamon one tablespoon or 13 grams of instant espresso and one teaspoon or three grams of cayenne whisted together and you have your hot chocolate spice all right it's assembly time per plate you will fill two to three crepes by spreading about two tablespoons of chocolate hazelnut butter in the center of the crepe folding it in half like a taco then folding that in half again one more time to form a nice little well triangle i guess repeat with the rest then arrange that nicely on a plate to give that a nice squiggly line i guess of melted gear deli semi-sweet chocolate chips just straight up melted and piped on like this that's it follow that up with a nice piping or in this case a squirt bottling a squirting all right of your creme anglaise and good lord it isn't looking that bad so far top that with some crushed toasted hazelnuts and a faddy dollop of whipped cream and finally a nice dusting of your mexican hot chocolate spice and i mean come on these crepes look utterly regal truly immaculate next we have a simplified and slightly untraditional crepe souzen in a medium pan add three quarters of a cup or 150 grams of granulated sugar half a cup or 110 grams of cubed cold unsalted butter set that over medium heat and let it bubble once it starts to caramelize and homogenize in the middle pour and stir in three quarters of a cup or 80 milliliters of orange juice and a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of lemon juice bring the heat to medium high stir to dissolve any remaining sugar add in the zest from one orange and let that boil and reduce until it starts to turn darker in color and becomes a nice syrup about three to five minutes then immediately add a third cup or 80 milliliters of grand marnier let it come to the boil and immediately ignite the steam for a nice little party wow look at that so cool hey fun fact this is totally safe to do if you're smart about it but do me a favor don't make this your little instagram moment where you let your hair down and show off your lovely locks okay let's keep this far away from being a hazard anyway once the flame goes out and you've got a nice reduced syrup simply spoon that on top feel free to add fresh orange segments if your heart desires and that was pretty gosh dying easy if you ask me much like our next and final crepe the breakfast version first we'll start with a basic mornae in a medium saucepan add two tablespoons or 28 grams of unsalted butter heat that over medium until fully melted then mix in two tablespoons or 20 grams of all-purpose flour until lump free and incorporated cook that out for about one minute then whisk in one and a quarter cup or 275 milliliters of whole milk keep mixing until hot and thickened then cut the heat and whisk in half a cup or 70 grams of grated gruyere cheese keep mixing until fully melted and emulsified then season the taste of salt in a small little touch of fresh grated nutmeg for that nice je ne sais quoi then jump straight into assembly first get a little crepe obviously in the center add one to three slices of prosciutto then add a nice couple of generous spoonfuls of your mornay sauce followed by fresh grated gruyere cheese make a little divot for your egg crack in one whole egg in the center of that divot then fold all the edges over to form a square hit that with flaky salt and a touch of olive oil this is actually truffle olive oil gotta get the flex you gotta and place in a 350 degree oven for seven or ten minutes or just until the white is cooked and the yolk is still running optionally while that's baking in a small bowl combine a small handful of finely chopped parsley three cloves of garlic finely chopped in the zest of one lemon toss together till combined and you have a gremolata hit it with a generous sprinkling of your gremolata and go to town when i say town i mean flavor tam buddy this is goddang wild west and we're the flavor sheriff all right now let's see if we can call ourselves crepe killers like if killers was spelled with a c does that make sense so we have three different crepes a sweet a sweet and a savory should we decide a favorite yeah i think we should i already know this is gonna be my least favorite it's the most traditional it's delicious i love a crepes who said don't get me wrong but i want to be at like a bistro in paris and like multiple people are smoking cigarettes around me and i'm like coughing and choking that's when i want to enjoy a crepe suzette so i'm not feeling the vibe as much with this but it's good now this kira deli shout out to them for sponsoring this looks busting oh my god instantly these are better cremon glaze chocolate hazelnut butter mexican hot cocoa seasoning roasted hazelnuts what more do you want this is a perfect dessert crepe end of story now this is an underrated way to eat a crepe so the outside of the crepe is a little bit crisp the inside is moist ladies and gentlemen this is a symphony you're either making this crepe or this crepe period end of story you want to know what else is circular soft and folds into any shape ready to be placed into the mouth b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our crepes three different ways just a major thank you to our sponsor ghirardelli for sponsoring today's video and giving us these beautiful massive quantity of ghirardelli baking chocolate chips i'm excited to use them and i will definitely do that because we already buy them so it's now now i get them for free let's get and just a reminder if you want to learn more about ghirardelli or ghirardelli baking chocolate chips go to your local grocery store pick yourself up a bag you ain't gonna be ready i'll tell you what now let's talk about these crepes they turned out beautifully the funny thing is every time i work with crepes or make a crepe recipe my immediate thought is oh i could have done this or i well now i want to do a jam one now i want to do one with this syrup and then brown butter and this and it's just a nice little reminder that you can do so many things with a crepe that you can't really do with a pancake i mean i guess you can but then you have to change the pancakes so much it's just they're very singular in what they can do whereas a crepe it just opens up the world in a way that really no other pancake can so take that as you will but with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] you

And you may be absolutely tickled to find out that you can make this version (one of the greatest big dub?) for...,2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, oh you get a bento box and it's great value for this price all those things real nice uh don't you think it should be something more like this that is but cheaper [Music] oh hey fall really is in full swing isn't it you know what that means that means the holidays are coming it's the perfect time to get my cookbook if you haven't gotten it then the time is now brother new york times bestseller four times in a row it's in stores everywhere it's 40 off on amazon the link is in the description go and get it so bento box is like a meal with add a perfect meal for someone like myself now it's a plethora of many different things you got tempura this and a cabbage salad here and rice here all sorts of things in one if you're indecisive welcome to your dreamland the whole concept of it creates this idea that you're getting a great deal you're spending this much money and getting a large array slash assortment of things but if you made it yourself and you took a little bit of love and care paid attention we can make it a whole lot cheaper so with all that said let's make this shall we let's make this easy to understand a bento box consists of many elements ours consists of a beautiful teriyaki chicken perfectly cooked rice that has been washed for god's sake a spicy garlic dipping sauce cabbage slaw and last but certainly not least is an ultra easy tempura vegetable let's start with the spicy mayo it's one of the most basic sauces i can possibly think of if you think you can't cook and you cannot make a spicy mayo then you might be right that's a joke anyone can cook start with a small bowl and combine a quarter cup 62 grams of mayo two tablespoons or 29 grams of sriracha three cloves of garlic grated season your taste or salt then add one tablespoon or 11 grams of white distilled vinegar whisk together until combined then keep refrigerated until it's time to use your sauce sauce next up rice well yeah cook it accordingly for the one billionth time i'm at this point i'm gonna stop saying it wash your ice cook it in a rice cooker if you have one i'm using one and a half cups or 300 grams of short grain rice in one and a half cups or 350 grams of water popped on the rice cooker and you got rice now the rice you choose obviously pretty greatly influences the price so choose the cheapest stuff you can find just none of that instant crap please right cabbage slaw also unbelievably easy and if you're wondering yes i'm front loading you with all the easy stuff because i'm performing mental and emotional culinary acrobatics for you literally doesn't get that much harder though first begin with half a head of green cabbage and you might be wondering josh why do you always use half a head well that's because for some reason when you shave cabbage it somehow grows 323.26 times in volume don't know how it just does so half ahead shaved as thinly as you can feel free to use a deathtrap mandolin to keep your shavings even pop that into a bowl along with one to two large carrots julienned then to that you'll add three tablespoons or 42 grams of mayo two cloves of garlic grated season your taste lightly with salt two tablespoons or 26 grams of white vinegar and one tablespoon or 15 grams of soy sauce and also a one inch knob of ginger grated nothing better than grating your knob on a sunday morning tills all that together until perfectly dressed in every little cabbagey crevice and pop in the fridge to let those flavors get to know each other nicely you know you gotta let them form an inseparable emotional bond so that you can eat every last little cabbage right in front of it next up chicken teriyaki first let's make the teriyaki sauce in a medium sized sauce pot add just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan toss in 2 cloves of thinly sliced garlic and let that saute just until it starts to toast and turn a golden color please don't take it past golden brown unless you wanted to taste real bad in which great case pal check mark for being culinary poop anyway then add a quarter cup or 62 grams of granulated sugar a quarter cup or 58 grams of soy sauce a quarter cup or 58 grams of white distilled vinegar stir that together to dissolve and bring that up to a boil once that comes to a boil reduce the heat to low and simmer and reduce by about 25 which will take around three to five minutes then in a small bowl combine one teaspoon or two grams of cornstarch and two teaspoons or eight grams of water whisk it together to make a slurry then whisk that slurry into your simmering teriyaki sauce and let it continue to cook down until it reaches a nice glazy consistency and this should be glossy strain them through a mesh trainer if you want to keep it clean you know what they say dirty sauce dirty mind now that you have your teriyaki sauce let's make the chicken look please don't over complicate this yaki what does yaki mean oh yeah usually that's going to imply being grilled not cooked in a medically sterile non-stick pan get down and dirty brother if you can get your hands on conroe grill also known as the yakitori style grill you know the kind that uses bincherton loaded up with preheated white hot beet jotan in the bottom light one side of your grill to be very high heat and the other side to be very low or completely off get yourself four large chicken thighs boneless and skinless season your chicken lightly with salt grease your grates then pop it onto the high side of the grill flipping often until beautifully colored on both sides and the internal temperature reaches 165 fahrenheit now brush your chicken with your teriyaki sauce to glaze flip so that the glaze side is physically on the grill clay impossible to say it's on the hot it's on the hot stuff okay blast it on the got bang heat till the glaze gets nice and tacky it's what you want glaze again and repeat on the other side once your chicken is done cover with foil to keep warm for our final move the tempura it's honestly super easy so hold your horses before you get your fingers flying in the comments in a medium-sized bowl add half a cup or 75 grams of all-purpose flour to that you're gonna whisk in gently one cup or 240 milliliters of chilled carbonated water until you have a nice loose batter then pop in an ice cube or two to keep the mixture cold and that's your tempura batter now we need to pick our vegetables here i'm gonna use half of a butternut squash peeled then sliced into half moons then i cut off about one cup worth of broccoli florets from the stem and one sweet onion sliced into nice three quarter inch rounds of course separating the rings out from their outside it's it's onion rings yeah pretty basic now we have all of our vegetables look at that it's a beautiful time it's like a little garden a garden ready to be deep fried now get yourself a five quart pot filled halfway with vegetable oil and heat it to 350 fahrenheit dredge your vegetable of choice into just plain all-purpose flour shake off the excess and dunk into your batter and immediately drop it to your oil don't hold on your dripping coated vegetable and let the goddang horses come home spanking your grandpa i don't know what i'm saying we gotta move quick when making tempura now optionally while it's frying you can use your hand to dip in the batter and allow additional batter to drip onto the vegetable as it fries this will create nice little crispy crunchy little thingy this is called painting your tempura sounds so poetic ah yes in the cool breeze of the swiss alps i like to spend my time painting tempura on the terrace anyway let that fry until it reaches a beautiful crisp deep golden color turn on a wire rack and immediately season generously with salt and you can add any other seasonings at this point like togarashi or whatever you like but you see the beauty of tempura isn't just how you can season it but rather the plethora of things you can dip it in speaking of beauty let's assemble this thing now you can either do this on a plate or in an actual bento box setup in this case i'm using a bento box first begin by filling the center well with your spicy mayo add a little padding of thinly sliced raw cabbage in one of the medium slots slice up a chicken thigh place it atop the cabbage then a nice mix of your vegetable tempura i've got three here butternut onion and the broccoli this is a goddang tempura medley next your cabbage slaw and then a nice layer of your rice and since this already sort of has a shape i decided to get geometric and press the rice into the shape of the mold ah yeah i know very michelin sorry for flexing so hard all right we're done right you think i would stop without garnishing wow unbelievable that you would think that lowly of me many of these are of course optional except the green onion and additional teriyaki to the mayo added a little line of togashi spice then naturally to the rice a nice little furakaki garnish artfully of course in the opposing direction of the tokarashi add some additional teriyaki sauce to your chicken along with a nice generous sprinkle of thinly sliced green onion and that right there homies is a beautiful bento box for this price per box right here people are thinking they're getting some sort of value in their bento box when you should have come to papa's bento box shop right here now let's see if this is as enjoyable as it is to look at so you sit down to eat and they just put that right in front of you what are you doing i'm gonna look down and just immediately look right back at the waiter waitress whomever and be like goddamn that is what a bento box should look like now wait josh but i like it like this or i like it like this shut up fine mix and match use different vegetables you don't want tempura do some sort of green salad with miso dressing you can still keep the price pretty low because this comes out to this price right here per person you're not going to go anywhere and find that all right let me tell you rock got bang now oh but i want to add sushi if you want to add makimono rolls we have a guide that's but cheaper already and links in the description you like that plug you're welcome all right so i'll break this all down chicken i understand that it's not quite realistic to grill it if it's a butt cheaper if you don't have a grill put it in a pan it's going to be just as good because the teriyaki sauce takes it all the way home perfectly balanced smoky cooked juicy always go for the thigh over the breast the rice i mean the rice is nice and look at this the rice is the most important component to this entire meal we all know how i feel about rice it must be perfectly cooked wash it for god's sake and cook it in rice cooker cabbage slaw as opposed to like a miso ginger salad you could do that too it's a symphony much better than a salad texturally more exciting the crunch you have a layer of flavors garlic ginger it's creamy yet acidic it cuts the richness of all this it almost brings it together like it's a little happy family last but not least tempura first off let's get a sound check on this the crunch on this is immaculate we have this beautiful dipping sauce right here nice and spicy little dip all of this put together a symphony in my mouth i can see it everyone watching me i'm conducting it in the lord hey kade come on you're tasting now ooh that's what i mean can i eat this okay i gotta finish the video bye anyway it's a symphony in front of you i can see everyone and something almost needs to constrain me a little bit because lord have mercy i have busted you're never gonna find a bento box like this ever again you hear me [Music] you wanna know where else you can have many things to put in your mouth for very little cost b-roll [Music] wow so yummy very fun at this point all these butt cheapers that we've done it does come down to cooking it yourself but there's little things that you do it's not just about the ingredients it's about the technique you can make great flavor with minimal ingredients that's the whole goddamn point you think these restaurants don't know that they care about their top line they care about their margin all right so when you're paying that money you're not getting uh the deal you think you're getting that's what we learned now with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something which like i said we learned that so you should have learned something then like and subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] you

Get My Cookbook:...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, so in good fun we challenge many people to cooking contests my mom my director my girlfriend is it fair probably not so to level the playing field let's try something different and point the arrow at me [Music] so as i've said most of the people that we've done cooking challenges with aren't really well i wouldn't say that they're cooking inept but look it's part of the fun okay it's entertainment are you not i'm not gonna no we're not gonna do that that quote it's time to put that quote to bed and then in the coffin part of what makes that so fun is i don't let them see what i'm doing and that's what the challenge is so how am i gonna challenge myself right put myself on a rolling ball while chopping something no i'm also gonna keep myself from seeing what i'm doing but what's the excitement behind that if there's no high stake item how about we make a one thousand dollar meal the goal is to make a beautiful contemporary plate of food using some of the most expensive ingredients in the world we have three for you a5 miyazaki wacky one of the most rare types of beef on planet earth two-tone etc caviar and last but not least black winter truffles these foods are so rare i don't want to mess them up i'm gonna do my best really i am i would not recommend anyone else do this but if you want to know where we got it we got it from regales so before we do this i want to get a little bit amped up i need some level of confidence so we're going to do a little taste test blindfolded and see how connected my senses are wow this is going to be a lot harder than i think it might be why did i do this i want to do something else now [Music] wow that's something you gotta cleanse the palate can i even get one gary do you want to just get the water for me that's probably a better idea i know this this is pee so this is the moment where i taste test all this stuff and i don't know what's in front of me fantastic hmm smells like a spice this is the doritos spice that i made smells like peanut butter is there even anything do you guys even put anything in here is this booby trap this is the peanut stuff that we put on the bow buns peanuts bliss with powdered sugar and salt oh that that's turmeric i know i'm on fleek right now i ain't even said that in a while i'm strong garam masala smells funky it's dry oh that's yukari hikari shiso seasoning this smells like it could potentially be spicy mama it's gochugaru whoa how'd i do let's [ __ ] go so my senses are calibrated i've had my little taste test we got six out of six homies we're doing great who's rooting for me if you're rooting in tune hit it in the comments let's do this i want to break this down into elements here brew laid onion and then a pea puree and a pan sauce and a steak keep it relatively simplistic jeez pearl onions bruleed yup this isn't a pearl onion this is easy just gonna find my knife everyone's nervous right now yeah that's in half this is easy first we got the taste test the next one is gonna be like let's see josh do a challenge with his legs broken all of my senses are heightened right now okay so we got the onions cut in uh top sorry i forgot to talk because i was too focused on trying not to cut my hand off you can make nice little shells how many pearl onions do you peel vikram none really you should probably work on that yep i'm getting a little too confident right now i don't want this pin anymore i don't know how much to turn this i'm guessing this is like medium is this medium what do you mean you're not gonna tell me i think this is oil all right so we're gonna let this get nice and hot how do i know when it's hot i don't know okay all right ow i'm gonna get a little press the thing is i know where everything is in my kitchen this is why it's important to keep an organized kitchen this is going to prove to you how organization is everything either that or i'm going to look like a complete idiot wouldn't be the first time that's not the right drawer that's not all right let's check and see if these are done ow are they charred they smell charred and i'm turning this off because it smells too charred i can't really comment on this because i don't know what the [ __ ] i'm looking at oh you know what these need a little bit of salt that's hot did i get them oh you know what that's the secret everywhere and then toss them in the salt yeah ow did we get it there okay well you know kendrick i've got a blindfold on yep that's exactly what i wanted i'm getting impatient now at this point full speed we're going full speed pea puree first off shallots uh we're gonna ham um yeah you like that you like that i don't know if these are even or not are they even or no let's go i'm not gonna do that moving forward i never could dance in the first place let alone with a blindfold this is kind of relaxing i might do this more often by myself with nobody here to supervise or protect me and i'll leave my phone really far away and dead in the corner somewhere in case there's an emergency i feel like these are really uneven ah okay that's smelling way too hot salts oh i don't remember where i put it maybe it'll have a good flavor to it the burn yeah now we're cooking smells awful i don't want to eat that peas are in turn the heat all the way down toss them around much penis all right i guess i do have to cook them now you can't burn them starting to get dizzy now i need wawa this is so disorganized what am i doing think think think i want to add truffle oil to this i think this is truffle oil that's just yeah sure why not yeah tastes terrible i need a blender we have our blender movie magic by that i mean they went and got it for me and i stood here that goes here oh yeah this is becoming very familiar to me this is so dangerous don't ever do this now i need to find this oh the spoon aha josh you're so smart what oh the spoon damn for all you know i could be asleep right now where's my shima flashbacks at the restaurant where did i put the sheen while on the chef's like where's the [ __ ] sheen oh it's always behind me aha cause sometimes people do make the same mistakes these pieces suck what is this oh i thought this was a knife this has to go in here wow that's amazing you got to use your senses here it's too thick oh that's the sound i want whew let's speed this thing up oh my god this is a [ __ ] nightmare sauce should be smoother and glossier than a mirror there we go oh this is good god damn oh i over salted it i think a little bit of acid and it'll be fixed like lemons it's a lime this is a rock that's a lemon ah no it's not is this a lemon oh orange orange a lemon this is a lemon but it's old this doesn't smell rancid though i'm doing this purposefully because i don't know what i'm looking at i don't want seeds in there i heard a seed i heard it kind of slide because it fell in like over here ah that's delightful all right so then this is all done this will get quinelled onto the plates so yeah it's steak time i'm tired it's time to portion the wagyu i really don't want to mess this up i'm sorry i love you somebody guide my hand paul becouse maybe i'll cut it into a steak and then portion that stick this is easy it can feel hard and you can acknowledge that it's hard why spend time focusing on how difficult it is and instead spend time on the task at hand and that's what we're gonna do i've got a plan here i'll indent how thick i want it okay so i've made an indention i know this is the wrong side of the knife don't think that i'm being dumb here i can't mess this piece of meat up it's gonna be such a disrespect i'm just gonna do it my heart is beating so fast did i do it hey all right okay that's a pretty good cut this is easy all right now i gotta trim the fat off this i'll use this fat for something else there's a little bit of meat there mostly fat i'm pretty sure we've got a little bit here fat is so delicate that it melts at room temperature you can see it all over my hands so i'm trying to move quickly but also not screw this up i feel like i'm doing pretty good though okay so we've got a steak i don't know if it looks very good it may not very thick for wagyu i'm gonna cut it in half yup okay that definitely was a piece of my thumb oh [ __ ] the grain runs the other direction the grain runs this way doesn't it why we're gonna go with a different kind of bar look this is still perfectly edible just won't be as tender oh yeah that that's nice look at this does that look good that's a nice little stick all right so this is our steak obviously we're not gonna use this entire thing i still had to order it okay we're gonna count that as the whole price god damn it ulysses i swear to god bro my senses are turned all the way up that was so loud that sounds crazy when the mask on oh my god really the hardest part is over this the rest is going to be easy wow oh i hear a knife you know how like toff and the airbender would be like and then she could like see everything that's with me right now i'm like there's the knife pretty accurate all right we got a wagyu which is really hard to tell to cook on so we'll put this on a medium high eggs and wakey steaky now you don't want to put a wet steak in the pan so i'm just gonna give it a little wrap in here to dry for a moment this should be getting pretty hot oh yeah that feels like a lot of salt pep all right now we're gonna roll this around in there okay oh god damn did you hear that that was my finger and this is gonna go right in there no oil in the pan because it's a5 wagyu it'll produce its own sweaty i think i put the presses oh that's a knife i put the presses over here i'm pretty sure it smells like a cheeseburger that has to exist somewhere in l.a it's too hot i can smell it this is pretty fun huh guys you guys having a good time you don't sound like you're having a good time vikram you don't sound like you're having a good enough time i can tell that there's a crust it may be burnt one two three are we looking good crusty i can tell it's pretty raw on the inside which is fine you could certainly serve this rare and it's very good rare [Music] this feels like it's done is there any fat in this pan it's gonna sear all the little edges and corners get some nice color make sure it's cooked to medium rare ow god damn that's hot oh yeah [Applause] this is probably done i'm gonna remove it i think that's the cutting board all right so the next step get your broth and you add that and deglaze the pan turn it up a little bit that sounds like i added too much and then we're gonna let that boil beef edge this that's boiling now the truffles which we will chave on top so truffles will go into the pan sauce where does the caviar go i guess i'll just it could be meat quinnell pan sauce caviar on the cornell we'll do two alternating quinels like one here and one here or no cornell quinnell yeah and then caviar caviar hand sauce pan sauce yeah that would look cool if it looks right you know that all the wood smells like olive oil how's that possible that's correct vic from magic good job smart little me already preset the thickness on it eat my poop sorry guys vikram laughs at anything that has to do with poop salty salty this doesn't smell that good don't have no guideline i wanna stop at this point all right in the next video vikram is going to edit blindfolded the chives will get added butter here it's nice and cold cut the heat and then we mount it with butter so you're going to vigorously shake get that emulsified emulsify emulsified sounds like soup maybe it's good though let's taste it it's like a jew it's actually pretty good yeah i like that at our chives and then our truffle oh yeah that all mixed in there oh yeah oh it's busting busting it doesn't even need salt so then we're ready to assemble oh we've reset i don't really know where everything is but i have a rough idea i gotta get all my pieces of the puzzle it's a home stretch all right guys we're doing it you all ready okay oh god i normally don't cut like this but i have no choice give me a freaking break i know someone's gonna be like you're not supposed to cut it like that oh really franklin because what's on my face what's this i think i don't know this feels pretty nicely tapered actually right there here's the side of the meat i want to put a little quinoa my heart rate is like 5 000 rpm okay so two canels that's what i said i wanted to do it feels like a good onion i'm gonna do it it's fine uh they say make it look natural okay here's peace meat uh put it right there where's the other puree where there you are all right how many did i put did i put three am i allowed don't tell me don't tell me am i shaking because i'm scared and one at the bottom of the steak i'm not gonna put any more there's that so here's my thumb hopefully i'm getting some truffle in this it's fine whatever it has the essence of truffle god that probably looks terrible where's the sprouts get a small amount of these and i'm gonna trim them in half i guess i'll just lay it down where's the sauce i haven't touched it with my finger yet all right you know what i'm just gonna put it on there oh uh flaky salt it is pepper i'll just do it up high done time except this isn't timed it's dinner time for kendrick bonjour ah i don't know what this is [Music] okay don't be scared [Music] delicious oh that might be a little bit full yep it's gonna be so good yo i'm gonna take off the mask see my masterpiece oh sh that's actually pretty good i'm going to go into cardiac arrest after that let's go is it cooked properly yeah it is what the day oh my god holy sorry i'm like touching your food i want to like almost fix it i'll take a photo of this it's a little messy with the sauce it's a little messy i'm ready to go to bed now [Music] so good yes can i have a bite [Music] dog bro get some of that juice too sorry folks i guess my ego is just going to keep growing this cannot this is not good for me it's upsetting how [ __ ] good that is most people would be like i'm glad that i achieved that but for me now it's just like my ego is now inflated to a point where it's that day it's at a dangerous level i just realized that i forgot the caviar uh whoops a daisy that sucks because this was the grand total for everything that we ordered so we're still using the title okay at least i have caviar in the fridge i can't complain about that so what did we learn today well we learned that anything is possible i'm the best of all time years of practice you could still do something with a blindfold that's pretty much it i don't know i don't know what to say like i was kind of hoping that i was gonna mess this up i actually feel like i didn't learn anything i don't know if we're gonna do more blindfold stuff or not but i do know that i'm gonna be cooking against more people and uh i didn't stop myself and nobody can stop me then so with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time because you almost certainly learned that can't stop us vikram's shaking because he his arm's tired [Music] you

And fine, maybe this gumbo isn't exactly perfect, but it's flavor profile is pretty dang perfect when you get that first spoonful. 

Get My...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, yeah sure a good hearty super stew is great but this takes both of those things and becomes their daddy [Music] okay so today we're making gumbo now there are many different varieties of a gumbo so i already know people can be in the comments saying something josh you can't do this josh can't do that what the hell brother this isn't cajun this isn't real i get it and i know the traditions but the thing that's special about gumbo isn't just what goes into it it is how it brings people together it is how it is served it is the taste the texture the anxiousness of what's in front of you that makes it special now do you feel a little bad we're using filet in place of okra because okra is disgusting the texture of it is something like if you're eating and then someone sneezed into your open mouth is that what you want i already know people gonna say josh don't mix land and sea you can't do that it'll mask the seafood flavor and while that is true in most scenarios the thing that i like about this is it starts with a strong seafood base with an excessive amount of seafood that definitely balances it out quite nicely guess what no one's going to get hurt and it's going to taste mighty fine as it is so with all that said let's make this shall we well well well we then got a gumbo and hey purists reminder if you want it ultra traditional then stick with either just seafood or just meat now granted you'll have to add a little chickie to the actual gumbo if you replace the meaty crab men anyway you can't have a great gumbo without a stock that's right we're doing a beefy shellfish stock first prep your mirror which is two onions quartered two carrots rough chopped next you need the shells from three to four lobster tails yes we're going to use the meat fun fact you can actually de-shell a lobster without cooking it highly recommend it just cut the hard ribs all the way down the underside give it a gentle crack on its side and carefully open it up fiddling the meat from its shell and it should pop right out like this reserve the meat and shell separately then you'll need 1 cup or 150 grams of shrimp shells which would literally just be all the shells from one pound of shrimp yes we're gonna add that shrimp too next break down three clusters of snow crab reserve the meat for the final gumbo and place the shells with the rest of your stock ingredients now get yourself a big ass pot add in just enough oil to coat the bottom blast it over medium high and sear off 2 pounds or 900 grams of bone in short rib and 2 pounds or 900 grams of boneless beef chuck roast see those bad boys on all sides for two to three minutes each or until you get some lovely my hard reaction then add in all your shellfish shells along with your vegetables which also include one tablespoon or nine grams of black peppercorns and three bay leaves then add about five quarts of water a small handful of fresh thyme then bring that up to a boil and immediately reduce to low and simmer skimming off any scum that rises to the top and let that cook down for five to six hours then remove the solids straight through a fine mesh sieve and that is your lovely surfan turf frog god i've always hated that term it sounds awful right before we make our gumbo i have a dangerous subject to jump into cajun spice now brother i know we love our tony chetris or whatever the hell your favorite brand is we need to give this one chance because it is hissing now strap yourself in because it's a long list in a medium bowl add one and a half tablespoons or six grams of garlic powder 2 tablespoons or 17 grams of cayenne powder 2 tablespoons or 12 grams of smoked paprika 2 teaspoons or 6 grams of onion powder 1 tablespoon or 6 grams of fresh ground black pepper 2 teaspoons or 2 grams of dried thyme i like to lightly crush it with my fingers and make it finer and bring out some more of its flavor 1 tbsp or 2 grams of dried oregano 2 teaspoons or 8 grams of guess what buddy [Music] it's in tons of store-bought cajun seasonings and it's freaking delicious brother 1.5 tablespoons are 11 grams of kosher salt 2 teaspoons or 6 grams of ground white pepper and one tablespoon or thirteen grams of dark brown sugar oh that was a doozy now give this some whiskey business until thoroughly combined and you have a cajun spice i'm not afraid to put in front of any of my cajun monami alright it is time we begin with the ultra important dark roux in a large stock pot that's at least 10 quarts add in half a cup or 90 grams of duck fat and half a cup or 90 grams of lard or bacon fat heat that over medium heat once that's melted add in one cup or 150 grams of all-purpose flour begin mixing that together until thoroughly incorporated and you pretty much have your room now all you have to do is let that bad boy cook stirring relatively frequently to avoid burning until it darkens to sort of a rich mahogany color this will take about 15 minutes so don't rush it take it nice and slow to achieve a proper color without burning once it's ready you can now add what's called the creole holy trinity which consists of three ribs of celery diced two onions diced and one large green bell pepper you guessed it diced let that saute just until softened then add 4 cloves of finely chopped garlic saute tell fragrant then add half a pound or 250 grams of andouille sausage and half a pound or 250 grams of kalbasa sausage both of which are already fully cooked smoked and sliced half an inch thick on a bias soda coat and once that sausage is hot and rendered out some of its fat add two and a half tablespoons or 35 grams of your cajun spice serve it in and let those spices toast for one minute then add three tablespoons or 41 grams of louisiana or crystal hot sauce three and a quarter quarts or three liters of your stock from earlier in one 20 ounce or 750 gram can of crushed fire roasted tomatoes now bring them to a boil and lower the heat to medium low and simmer for one hour all right we're on the home stretch after one hour of simmering add in two half teaspoons or three grams of gumbo filet powder simmer for 25 more minutes then add in just the bottom segment from two clusters of snow king crab you know the little pointy parts they have less meat but the shells contain a lot of flavor i threw in a big claw as well why not now for the rest of those clusters gently remove the meat and place it to the side next you'll add three whole snow crab clusters broken into individual pieces your one pound of raw peeled and deveined shrimp and your raw and also peeled three to four lobster tails which i also deveined and cut into one inch chunks now lower that heat to low and very gently simmer that for 15 more minutes then stir in another two and a half teaspoons or three grams of gumbo filet powder simmer five more minutes add all of your king crab meat three tablespoons or 45 milliliters of worcestershire sauce wow i got it right that time nice and once that meat is nice and warm in my mouth you're ready to serve now get yourself a shallow bowl and add in enough gumbo to your heart's content add a fat scoop of beautifully perfectly steamed rice and yes oh yes i washed it you did too and finally a nice little sprinkle of thinly sliced chives that is a stunning bowl of gumbo if i ever dog gone sing one but oh wait what's going into this bowl is that a pad of [Music] yes if you want to be real naughty you can make a nice little cajun butter by combining one cup or 225 grams of salted softened butter one and a half teaspoons or six grams of msg four cloves of garlic grated half a bunch of thinly sliced chives mix and fold together until thoroughly combined and screw it add a little cajun spice too why not and that's your butter now get a sheet of plastic wrap plop your butter into the center and spread into a seven inch long strip roll the plastic wrap around that fully enclosing your butter then grab the two sides and let it roll and wind up into a sausage let that chill in the fridge until solid slice into medallions and stir into a piping hot bowl of gumbo now with or without msg let's taste test this and see how we did on our gumbo brother it's a goddamn that's a goddamn knee slapper look at this color it's like a fine mahogany i feel like we're at a woodworking shop and i just see a beautiful just natural mahogany plank i'm really excited about this one if you guys can't already tell now let's try the normal one without the msg butter bless america this is this is a perfect gumbo i mean many might have something to say oh do this and we didn't do that shut up this is delicious i've had many gumbos many of them are different but there's a few similarities not only does this contain those traditional similarities what you're looking for in a gumbo it's just a little elevator all right first off the msg is a little bit of when you taste it on your tongue it's seasoned perfectly it's got the right level of spice there's the smokiness from the msg butter if you make this you are not allowed to make it without the garlic msg butter period end of story it is what it is if you've never made gumbo before or you have made it before it just doesn't matter this is the gumbo you should make [Music] you want to know what else entices the joie de vivre [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our gumbo it came out beautifully it was a rich dark anxious almost caramel color and that is what it should look like it's smooth it's got the nice texture it's smoky you can taste the seafood come through the crab shell simmering in there big fat juicy piece of king crab flopping in your mouth god damn that's enough to make you slap your grandma but don't actually do that because i i don't want to get in trouble for that but anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like

too basic dry shortbread caramel that has zero flavor and of course milk chocolate that is just liquid sugar there's no depth of flavor there's no excitement to it that's a that's big talk and we're gonna walk the walk so with all that said let's make this shall we it's our first walgreens trip you know they really could have worked on that logo there ah the washington nationals what does that have to do with walgreens josh well let's look at their logos who let that happen we'll let the dogs out as seen on tv i'm always super intrigued by what they have here they're always so innovative i hate this all right so we've got this is still a bag what would you class of the wrapper i guess well aesthetically on the outside i would say that this looks like a turd with a snickers bar you have the vein we will talk about that another day so this is probably my least favorite candy bar in the world i already know what to expect so let's just get this over with somehow worse than my expectations i really don't want to eat this i'm just gonna go spit it out there's a little bit stuck on my tooth now all day i'm gonna be like it's cute for a dog not for a person nobody wants that breakdown of this everything about this candy bar i hate i don't know why it's just dry shortbread the caramel doesn't really taste like anything at all but like sugared chew and then the chocolate is just sweet fat not what you want huh let's just get this over with all right we can do better though to clarify we're all having an argument about whether why i spit out the twix okay i have to address this now because everyone's really upset about it let me clarify twix is bad but not bad in the sense of not enjoyable it is boring to me that is my statement of the day to be honest this is one of the easiest candy bars i've ever made so let's get to work here first we need our salted butter shortbread base wrassle yourself a large bowl and add two cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour three-quarters of a cup or 100 grams of powdered sugar give them that whiskey business slap your knee then add one cup or 225 grams of salted butter that's been softened using a pastry cutter or two forks cut that into the flour and just keep doing that until you get a crumbly shaggy dough then add one teaspoon or 10 grams of vanilla extract switch to a spatula and repeatedly fold that mixture together until you get a beautifully soft dough wow look at that no salt required because the butter is salted [Music] now heavily spray a 9x13 baking dish with non-stick cooking spray coat every got dang edge now you could lay parchment in here as pastry insurance but uh to be honest i didn't really want to and you kind of don't have to anyway press set their dough evenly into your baking dish until it evenly coats the even bottom did i mention you should spread it evenly then just pop that bad boy into an oven that's been preheated to 325 degrees fahrenheit and bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until very light golden and dry pull her out and cool completely before moving forward wow look at that magically cooled thanks movie magic moving on to caramel look this is sort of a shortcut caramel which i imagine is likely something like what these candy bar makers are doing so a little traditional in a little um mass manufactured if you will in a medium sauce pot wait pause we got a new sauce pot all right so uh everybody just take a look at it and appreciate it please new soft spot goofing anyway add in one and a quarter cup or 195 grams of light brown sugar one and a quarter cup or 370 grams of light corn syrup 14 ounces or 400 grams of sweetened condensed milk which i do have a homemade version for in my pumpkin pie recipe should you desire to make your own yes it's better link in the description and finally one cup or 227 grams of softened salted butter i know i know usually butter is added at the end blah blah blah just trust me we've got corn syrup in here all right that's got nature defying properties to it set the to medium heat and let it come to a rolling boil stirring occasionally oh yeah you also don't normally stir our caramel we're just breaking all the rolls today look at that let that reduce until it reaches 235 degrees fahrenheit cut off the heat and immediately stir in the beans from one vanilla bean pod make sure they get dispersed evenly then immediately pour your hot caramel over your cooled shortbread let the cool completely uncovered then cover with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for at least two hours but ideally overnight fast forward and it's solidified and ready to come out and join the rest of the world maybe it'll cuddle with me in bed or maybe i'll stop there okay using a bed scraper or a sharp knife run it around the edges until you've loosened your candy from the baking pan see this is why i probably should have put parchment in it to make a little easier but it's whatever carefully remove it and place on a large cutting board look portioning this can be a little challenging but you know what life wouldn't be fun without a little challenge here and there using a sharp clean knife cut that into well twix shaped bars something like three and a half inches by one inch i first started with one inch wide long bars and then cut those bars down into three and a half inch long segments it's not rocket science folks just make sure your knife is sharp for once please it helps keep the shortbread mostly intact once you have your bars and you'll have about as twice as many as you see here on this tray you're now ready to coat the chocolate it cozy bells makes me so funny look you can't just use plain old melted chocolate well you can but it'll be ugly you ideally want to use tempered chocolate and i'll be honest tempering chocolate is extremely annoying and it makes me want to run my body through a wall and i imagine many of you will get impatient doing it oh josh i messed up and it's your fault to simplify we'll use the same method in our butterfinger video the stupid microwave version which actually does work surprisingly well you'll take 16 ounces or 450 grams of 60 to 70 cacao chocolate very finely chop that and place in a heatproof glass bowl pop that in your microwave on high for 30 seconds stir hit it for another 30 seconds stir again hit it for 15 seconds stir now at this point you need to check the temp of the chocolate make sure it does not go above 90 degrees fahrenheit if it's close then keep gently stirring until it goes down a touch and then microwave it one last time for 10 more seconds stir and it should be fully melted and just below 90 fahrenheit for all the chocolate confection people is this the perfect way to do it absolutely not not even close but it is an easy solution for a decent chocolate coating anyway to cool your chocolate just dip your bars into the melted chocolate coat thoroughly remove with a fork optionally drain on chopsticks and place on a sill pad then just top with smoked flaky salt for the flex that's really it honestly you just let those cool until they're hardened take them off the silpat and trim those frilly edges so the bars are straight and look at that this isn't just some candy bar this is a rectangular prism that brings a textural wonderland full of real flavor raining joy down on the people that so choose to pick up this obelisk of flavor not really sure if this fits the term obelisk but good lord slap my knee throw my bit out the window tie my leg to a horse and spank it it's got that perfect caramel stretch now let us taste test wow this is what you want right here kendrick no you don't want it it's okay you're right it is okay perfect ratio of caramel to shortbread literally equal parts equal does this look equal to you i'm gonna cherish this moment just to point out that i'm literally always right about everything all the time i've never been wrong my entire life jokes aside this is what twix wants to be this is how they ended up stomped on a lot of you guys asked me to stomp on your neck i'm not going to do that but i will stomp on twix's neck okay so today we have a different taste tester kate i'm not wearing the poop one that's gross i like papa kiss so pc all right so do you like twix kid how do you feel about twitch i'm a big fan of twix can you describe me why you like twix i can't but i also like dark chocolate she's the only one in this building besides myself that likes dark chocolate and that's why you're here today is that correct i think so taste test number one are you ready yes there we go bite number one those are really good i like that one all right that was number one now we're on to number two every time kate tastes test i don't ever know what to expect she's a wild card here's my take on this number one it was very good very soft i felt like there was a lot more flavor number two it was like not very good which one do you think the twix was number two it was just bland you know but i still like twix kate the lady thank you so much guys heard it here kate's one of the only ones that won't lie because everybody here has to get paid what did we learn today we learned the twix is really just not that good it's a vikram when it really comes down to it you want to make something special that people will remember forever you'll do this thank you you want to know what else has long bars dipped in chocolate ready to receive a gentle lick of the tongue in a gentle chew what am i saying b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our twix what did you expect how did you expect this to go we knocked it out of the park they got absolutely stomped on i can tell you for damn sure if i'm making these i'm not handing them out to little brats coming to my door all right sorry kids but i'm not making these for you i'm probably gonna go buy twix and give you those but just be aware that you can make these for yourself munch on these and then hand out the other stuff to the kitties all right they don't care they just want sugar oh am i in heaven right now we're just gonna roll with this we're gonna roll anyway with all that said if you

Additional Cookbook Options (other stores,...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, is one of the easiest and most versatile breakfast items in the world what more do you want me to say [Music] [Music] okay so let's talk frittatas now i don't think we make enough of them people aren't talking about them enough but i do know that frittatas should be a higher topic of conversation they're special you can do so many things with them you can add anything in them as long as you cook the ingredients that are in there if they have water in them you gotta cook that out first but it makes cooking breakfast or brunch for a crowd easy it's something you can serve at room temp you can even have it for lunch if you're like that dinner why not awesome with all that said let's make this shall we right a frittata oftentimes overcomplicated is one of the easiest ways to serve breakfast or brunch to a crowd or really any meal for that matter i have three versions here a basic frittata something a little fancier with merguez and garlic chantilly yeah you like that fancy little word and last though not traditional a bacon frittata and cheese sando let's begin with mr simplistic first find yourself one large red bell pepper pop that directly onto an open flame of a stovetop and char all sides of your pepper until completely blackened you'll want this at max heat and of course the addition of a blowtorch always helps with honestly most scenarios if you have an electric stove then i would recommend getting a blowtorch and you know going to town once every square inch of that fang is charred pop it into a bowl cover with plastic wrap or foil and let it steam for five minutes to get out of the bowl wipe off all the char with a paper towel and chop it into one-inch chunks now in a 10-inch skillet with an oven-safe handle i repeat oven safe but what happens if it's not safe well i'm not very good at math but i can tell you that the rate of heat added to the non oven safe handle equals a deep sorrow that burns far into the recess of your wallet to that pan add two tablespoons of olive oil heat it over medium heat until hot hot add in one sweet onion that's been nicely julienned season that the taste of salt and saute that for two minutes or until it begins to soften then add your roasted pepper and continue to saute for three more minutes or until it starts to pick up some color in a bowl add in nine large eggs beat them thangs hard until you incorporate some air in the mixture is homogeneous then beat in one teaspoon or five grams of kosher salt a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of heavy cream and a quarter cup plus two tablespoons or 90 milliliters of whole milk whisk together until combined and add that to your pan from there add in about one cup or 70 grams of grated cheddar and a quarter cup or 55 grams of crumbled feta gently stir that mixture just until the eggs begin to pull from the pan and immediately pop that thang in an oven preheated to 350 fahrenheit ideally on convection if you've got it for 15 to 18 minutes or until a beautifully puffed and cooked frittata emerges you know just a slight amount of color on top is nice let that cool for one minute then invert onto a plate add some additional grated cheese of choice maybe some black pepper and a little touch of olive oil and that is your lovely simple frittata oh right that reminds me i do have a cookbook that has many other breakfast recipes did you know that now next up is mr fancy pants honestly it's really the exact same technique but adapted with protein this is the beauty of a frittata it's all done in one pan wait a minute does this make it a one-pan meal i've always disliked that term and the answer is sort of yes but not really now you have 25 more things you have to wash up high right so in a 10-inch skillet either non-stick or cast iron is fine adding just enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan heat over medium-high until hotter than the seething hatred i have for unseasoned beef and add in one bunch of green onions that have been cut into one-inch segments let those sear until wilted and some light charring has occurred then add three links of myrga sausage that's already been cooked and it's been sliced into quarters let that sear until most of its fat is rendered and it's beginning to get some nice color added one teaspoon or one gram of very finely chopped fresh thyme leaves stir together until fragrant then again in a bowl add your nine eggs take out all your frustrations and beat that gosh dang time then add in a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of heavy cream your quarter cup plus two tablespoons or 90 mls of whole milk and lastly your one teaspoon or three grams of kosher salt pour that into your pan along with half a cup or 20 grams of grated pecorino cheese 4 ounces or 110 grams of fresh chef crumbled on top pop that into your oven 350 ideally convection for 15 to 18 minutes let it do its thing now this time while we're waiting in a medium sized bowl add half a cup or 120 milliliters of heavy cream begin whipping that with a whisk constantly until it reaches soft peaks like this right here yes it's a whipped cream then grate in one garlic clove mix together until evenly distributed and that's it a savory garlic chantilly now again out of the goddang oven and look at that remove your frittata onto a plate coat that dang in grated cheese maybe a little drizzle of some truffle infused olive oil slice it like a pie place it on plate give it a gentle quinoa of your garlic chantilly right on top of your slice hit with chives first cracked black pepper flaky salt and look at that a fancy frittata worthy of the title prince dare i say king of frittatas now hold your horses buddy what if you have leftover frittata or better yet you just decide to go against the grain here cook yourself some bacon in a pan over medium heat flipping often until your level of cook has been achieved some people like it crispy and some like it flaccid either is fine by me snag yourself some brioche buns toast those bad boys up in a little bowl mix together a third cup or 61 grams of mayo 2 tablespoons or 26 grams of cholula or crystal hot sauce 2 tablespoons or 32 grams of sriracha and salt to taste stir together in this little surprise for your buns now to assemble add a slice of swiss cheese or any cheese you're choosing melt that on your bottom bun with a blow torch or under your broiler hit with a nice layer of your sauce followed by your bacon strips now this is the magic using a round biscuit cutter that's roughly the same diameter as your buns cut out as many pieces of frittata as you need now plop that onto your sandal add another slice of cheese melt again sauce your top bun generously with spicy mayo and finally lower that bun to crown your king me oh my this makes so much sense and yet nobody seems to really be talking about it wake up it's time to open your eyes to the frittata breakfast sandwich world now let's place all three of these options side by side and see which one could be our most ideal choice welcome to breakfast time this the basic one in all of its glory with the cheese full salted perfectly it's got all the flavors you want it's not like too fancy right a lot of time people see the word frittata and they're like oh my god that sounds kind of fancy well it's fine because this is simple flavors that you'll understand and enjoy now this on the other hand merguez we had a very hard time finding this bon appetit this would be awesome if you have this little salsa verde on the side but then why didn't we do that vikram what the hell i know it was my job to do that but why did i not do that this would be great with any echo drama you can sausage how you want you can eat them just as they are or if you want to take it a step above you can make this sandwich that looks busting i'm gonna put this in me okay holy sh why did we even make the fritzata in the first place what we should have done is double this recipe put it in a 9x13 baking dish get our hole puncher and have a bunch of buns and just hole punch it out and you've got a breakfast sandwich party for the homies right here i'm gonna try this goddamn sandwich that's a lot of bite to get through this is very good every part of that is incredible i'm not usually an egg guy and this is like i need this entire thing what did we learn today frittatas are delicious and incredibly easy to make and you can mix and match however you want to but it does not end there it ends with a sandwich either way you're going to be putting something in your mouth that's delicious and moist you want to know what else has papa's most jiggly beautiful moist eggs in plain sight b-roll [Music] our guys and that is it so we made our my little tummy the lesson learned is that you don't necessarily have to follow this recipe you just need to understand that you can make this into whatever you want it's a choose your own adventure like i'm playing gears of war but with like eggs and it's literally nothing like that we all like to have choices okay and i'm giving you that option but the more important thing that you should understand is if you choose not to eat the frittata as is you could always have it as a little sandwich a sandwich everybody loves a breakfast sandwich i don't know a single human being on this earth that doesn't love a breakfast sandwich now with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you live so then leave a like subscribe and i will see you [Music] you

Additional Cookbook Options (other stores, international,...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, so these aren't generally considered expensive but hear me out you're paying six to eight dollars for how many four six a hundred you never really know when you could have the greatest of all time for this price right here that's but cheaper so [Music] okay so today we're making dumplings but not just any dumplings completely homemade dumplings for this price i know we already said it but i just have to reiterate this this is ridiculous why would you not want this this is like what you pay for like really crappy frozen ones that you it says you got to do it with the steam basket and everything but in reality you just pop it in the microwave and like the outside's still like frozen the inside's piping hot and like what have i done is that what you want no that doesn't sound good we're gonna make three cookie methods pan fried steamed and a lacy skirt dumpling you don't know what that is you never put a little skirt on do a little dance let's let's just make this let's just stop talking and make this okay let's have a silly little discussion of fresh dumpling dough versus store-bought one package of circular dumpling wrappers cost around two dollars and fifty cents that seems good but let's make our own first you'll need a large bowl add in one and a half cups or 225 grams of all-purpose flour half a cup or 75 grams of bread flour mix to combine then separately get two thirds of a cup or 147 grams of hot water and when i say hot i mean hot hot good low dissolve half a teaspoon or two grams of kosher salt into that water then pour that into your flour mixture and begin mixing until you get a shaggy dough then knead that fine for about five to seven minutes or until get a beautifully smooth and supple dough wrap that with plastic wrap give it a wholesome and kind-hearted personality and rest for 15-20 minutes from there you'll divide it into four to six pieces and using a pasta roller or rolling pin roll it into a very thin sheet you know on a pasta roller you'll obviously need to roll it starting from the thickest setting and landing somewhere around number five or six and by the way you know thin is not barely thinner than a two by four you wanna be able to see your got dang hand through this dough once you have your sheet get a three to four inch biscuit cutter depending on how big you want these and cut out circles that's it repeat that with all of your dough now that puts you at this price for homemade dumpling dough that makes a similar amount of one package of store-bought which is around 50 wrappers total i will say that it is significantly more annoying to make these without the pasta roller and well pasta rollers cost money so it's gonna be up to you to decide what to do here now you can't call it a rapper unless you got something to fill it with filling is undeniably easy so no complaining to papa get yourself a medium bowl and add one pound or 450 grams of ground pork to that you'll add three cabbage leaves finely chopped and by the way quick method of fine chopping cabbage remove their cores i very finely slice this into ribbons then turn that the other way around and cut against the grain to get a very very fine chop now optionally you can give it a few more passes with a knife to get it even finer then add that to your pork along with a one inch knob of ginger fresh grated three cloves of very finely chopped garlic three green onions very thinly sliced half a teaspoon or three grams of sugar a quarter teaspoon or two grams of fine sea salt yes this looks like more because i got a little wild here on the salt one tablespoon or 14 grams of soy sauce one teaspoon or four grams of optional sesame oil then using your hands give it a nice mix kneading for about two minutes or until everything is thoroughly incorporated and homogenized that's it that's the filling now before we fill our little baby dumpers we're going to make our dipping sauce in a small bowl add a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of white vinegar and a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of soy sauce mix that together and that's actually it somehow this perfectly balanced mix of tart and umami saltiness is what makes up that classic liquid that you dunk your dumpers into that lead directly to a good old-fashioned bus feel free to add a tiny splash of toasted sesame oil or chili oil i did both but neither are necessary and it's perfectly delicious without it so we're not counting that towards the total although if we did it would be this much all right we're ready to fill get yourself a row of dumpling wrappers and fill like so first add a heaping teaspoon of meat into the center brush the perimeter of a wrapper lightly with water then to shape first close it like a taco pinching the top of the taco together and starting with one side crimp one part of the dough towards that center pinch to keep it folded then working your way to the edge crimp a second one over that and then the third and now you've crimped one side then crimp the other side bing bang boom make sure there's no air bubbles and all the seams are sealed and that's it look it will take some practice to get right it's okay if it's not perfect there's no reason to feel embarrassed no matter how terrible pathetic or ugly it could possibly be look i'm joking wrapping dumplings is like life before your very eyes you observe what looks like such a long stretch of road you may be unsure how long it will take to get to the other side or if you will at all for that matter but working through each of these things one by one one foot after the other and sooner than you know it you've made it to the other side dumplings like life anyway once you've repeated that with all of your dumplings you're ready to cook these bad boys i got three cooking methods for you pan fried steamed in a lacy little skirt obviously the easiest version is steam to get a steamer basket place it over a simmering shallow pot of water add in some cabbage leaves so your dumplings don't stick to the basket fit as many dumplings as you can within reason don't get them all over each other then cover the top and let that steam for a total of eight minutes remove the top hit it with some optional sesame oil and well that's it like i said easy now for the pan fried version get a 12 inch non-stick skillet add just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan with a very thin layer heat that bad boy to medium heat then once that's hot add in your dumplings in a circular pattern as many as you can without overlapping and just let those bad boys cook and get some color for two to three minutes or until the bottoms look like this good lord look at that thing little bubbles all around golden brown it's a beautiful thing anyway once they look divine on the bottom quickly add in a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of water immediately cover with a lid and let them steam maintaining that temp for three minutes then remove the lid and if any water is remaining at all let it continue to simmer until all that is evaporated and they're done remove them from the pan and you have beautifully steamed and crisp bottomed gyoza wow now last but certainly the most exciting is the skirt version these take a little practice now it's almost exactly the same as the gyoza version only difference is that once you've added your dumplings and they've reached that crusty golden brown bottom that makes me absolutely bus instead of adding water you're going to whisk together a slurry consisting of half a cup or 118 grams of water and 2 tablespoons or 19 grams of all-purpose flour whisk it until thoroughly combined then add that to the pan making sure it coats the entire bottom close the lid and let it steam for three to four minutes remove the lid and let it bubble out any additional water and you should have a crazy thin twill-like crust on the bottom carefully loosen it from the pan then invert that onto a plate and that's it but this is pretty cool all right i think it looks cool and it does have a function because it adds an unbelievable claunch to the bottom of your dumplings now we have dumplings cooked three different ways with all of that for a price of this per serving look it doesn't get any better than this play with the fillings to customize it further while i play with my dumpling and by that i mean it's taste test time look at that sorry i forgot he had headphones on that's my bad so this isn't even all of them and it's for this price right here three iterations bip boppity boop i always see people dunk them like that right and then you eat it and you're like oh that was pretty good except like literally none of the sauces in it so what you do you bite a little bit right you open her up and you spoon that in there you can see it drip down pop it good lower you pop it and lock it oh my god right off the bat steam versus pan fried there's no comparison that brown that little brown part of the gyoza skin will make you bullish instantly ain't even got to ask me out on date first i'll go straight for that last but not least are these fellas now josh why why put a skirt on because cue wrong because it's crisp it's extra crisp that's crisp and these have been sitting for like an hour for a little extra effort you can have all of that however you want it'll take you the same amount of time to make this as opposed to even getting take out i'm sorry but my dumplings are already done and i've saved money so you want to know what else is full of big glistening dumpies ripe for the picking b-roll [Music] okay so that is it we made our dumplings they were fantastic fantasmic hold on now can we call merriam-webster yes hello i'd like to add a new word you don't like it that's fine these dumplings came out beautifully it's a simple process at the end of the day it just takes time to do the little but that's fun right you bring people over have a great old time you drink some champagne or maybe nothing maybe just drink water but nonetheless you can have a beautiful time and dozens and dozens of dumplings for an egregiously low cost that are the best that you'll ever eat that's the whole point of this series take it or leave it buddy [Music] you

This is the best katsu dish ever. It's easy to make, fun to eat, nearly everyone that has ever had it loves it... it's your turn now.

Yukari:...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, all know that you can't make fried food taste better than it already does right wrong [Music] so today we're making curry katsu if you don't know what this is this is basically two of my most favorite foods of all time combining japanese curry and katsu what more do you want but more specifically it uses one of my favorite ingredients of all time are there any guesses there there should be some right it goes a little bit like [Applause] which is why i'm excited to announce today's sponsor and my favorite brand that produces it achinamoto you've seen me use it all the time a lot of you guys have started using it and you love it and you've noticed that it is perfectly safe to eat nobody really knows where this whole myth came from oh well if i can't pronounce it i'm not gonna eat it really there's tons of plants and foods that you can't pronounce there's been numerous scientific studies around it that have all proven that it's safe to eat all it is is an isolated amino acid of glutamate that's mixed with sodium that's it chances are you probably eat glutamate every single day because it's naturally occurring in so many foods that we eat both meat and plants at the end of the day this is a powerful ingredient that you can add to your arsenal and add to foods when it makes sense so if you want to learn more visit the link in the description go to nomsg.com so anyway curry katsu this is exactly what i described it as it is pork katsu served over rice with a nice japanese curry now traditionally you'll see oh potatoes and peas and carrots and oh my god look at that curry's like a little stew if you want to add that that's up to you but at the end of the day it is about that curry sauce and we're going to make the most splendid velvety beautiful sauce to go with the crispiest pork katsu of your life with all that being said let's make this shall we human beings love to overcomplicate things let's simplify this process this consists of four components the katsu the curry obviously sweaty perfectly cooked rice and optional yukari pickled cabbage now while that's optional we're gonna begin with the pickle get yourself half a head of red cabbage slice it as thinly as you can now if you want those slices paper thin and ultra consistent then you can totally use a mandolin just pray to the mandolin gods that your hands survive and by that i mean be careful because this is easily the most ruthless and dangerous kitchen utensil in the entire universe place it into a large container then snag yourself a medium-sized sauce pot and add two cups or 480 milliliters of rice vinegar 1 cup or 240 milliliters of water 2 tablespoons or 30 grams of granulated sugar and 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of salt set that over medium high and as soon as that brother comes to a boil cut the heat and stir in 1 tablespoon or 8 grams of yukari shiso rice seasoning then immediately pour your hot pickle liquid over your cabbage threads and you're going to use all of that now to ensure that it stays submerged add a sandwich bag filled with water clothes and on top then just let that sit at room temp until it completely cools down and you now have yukari pickled cabbage remove the weight and keep it in your fridge all right let's dive right into the main event the curry first in a large sauce pot add a quarter cup or 56 grams of unsalted butter set over medium heat then once melted and blue blend add in three sweet onions that have been julienned cook the stirring often adjusting your heat back and forth from medium to low medium to low to avoid burning for 30 to 45 minutes now you may have moments where the pan is a tad too dry it's kind of starting to burn so feel free to add a small splash of water when that happens to deglaze the bottom now while those are cooking bring one quart of good chicken stock to boil and add a quarter cup or 20 grams of dried and sliced shiitake mushrooms after about two minutes your shroom should be remove the mushrooms and place to the side now once your onion is beautifully deep caramelized they're ready get an oddly large green apple peel that bad boy and grate it then add that to your caramelized onion along with one tablespoon or 15 grams of tomato paste stir that together add your rehydrated mushrooms that you forgot and let that saute for three to five minutes or until the apple is softened then remove all that and place it in a bowl to the side now this is where people would just add a pre-made japanese curry mix right where the hell do you think you are buddy we're making our own add in a half cup or 112 grams of unsalted butter set over medium heat then once melted in bubbling whisk in half a cup or 75 grams of all-purpose flour cook that while constantly whisking for about 30 seconds then add one tablespoon or 12 grams of garam masala a quarter cup or 30 grams of s b curry powder one and a half teaspoons or seven grams of whisk that together and let that toast for about one minute stirring occasionally then add back all of your oil mixture then add one tablespoon or 14 grams of dark soy sauce 2 tablespoons or 25 grams of worcestershire sausage sauce worst dish or rooster sauce you know what i'm sick of it rename this one tablespoon or 15 grams of honey then whisk in that one quart of shiitake mushroom fortified chicken stock let that heat stirring often until thickened and let that simmer for two minutes adjust the salt levels to taste then pop that bad boy in a blender and blend on high speed until extraordinarily smooth and when i say smooth i mean like velvet please just wait the extra 30 seconds once that's the correct consistency while constantly blending you're gonna add in three and a half tablespoons or 50 grams of cold butter one tablespoon at a time until all of it's added and emulsified that should make your sauce beautifully glossy and smooth then all you gotta do is pass that through a fine mesh trainer or sheenwa into a new pot and simply keep it warm i mean look at this thing that is one of the most luxurious and delicious japanese curries that will ever touch your lips if you did it right which you did right now i've touched on rice many many times i'll make this quick wash your rice you're not allowed to make this recipe if you do not wash it plain and simple fine mesh strainer in a bowl fill with water agitate discard water and repeat one more time pop that in the greatest rice cooker on earth equal parts water this is a short grain tamaki gold rice by the way close the lid press the on button and you have perfect rice it's that easy no more rice porridge please okay it's katsu time now you need four boneless pork chops sure you can use the kind of loin chops that come from a center cut pork loin roast but i actually prefer to get the nice fatty rib chops like these and simply cut them off the bone see the problem is everyone likes to trim the fat off what do you not want any of the juicy juicy squirt squirt first once you've got your d-bone pork score the fat cap nicely all the way down so your meat doesn't curl while it's cooking then optionally on the exposed meat portion you can very lightly score it with a sharp knife in a cross-hatched pattern no more than an eighth of an inch deep on both sides then using a meat mallet or in this case a little pot i'll order it later it's fine anyway you're gonna beat them brothers down until they're about half an inch thick then season them generously with salt and just a tiny little bit of then place them in the fridge covered to cure for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight now once you're ready to fry the breading station is one of the easiest in the game you need one bowl filled with half a cup or 75 grams of all-purpose flour another bowl filled with two eggs and a splash of water beaten until homogeneous in one bowl with 2 cups or 240 grams of panko breadcrumbs then all you gotta do is take each chop one at a time give them a nice toss in the flour coat every little crevice shake off the excess then dip and coat every single angle in egg wash let that drain slightly and finally press into the panko breadcrumbs ensuring every square inch is coated with panko you know how i feel about uncoated portions of meat it's a no-goo now just repeat that with all of your chops then fill a large heavy bottom pot with about two and a half inches worth of vegetable oil heat it to 340 fahrenheit and fry your pork chops one to two at a time depending on the size of your pot like these were so thick that it was kind of difficult to fit more than one so that's totally fine and fry for 46 minutes or until you pull out something so beautifully golden brown and crisp that the human brain automatically knows that it's going to be then just repeat with olive dikatsu now we assemble get yourself a nice bowl add a nice generous portion of rice leaving a little pocket on the edge for your curry then in that pocket ladle in as much or as little curry as you desire this is also where you might add some steamed veg if you wish for that to be in your curry now reminder do not slice your katsu until you're ready to serve so now we are going to slice it and on top of that you should listen to this oh good lord now add that to your bowl kind of just barely dipping its toesies in the curry then that yokari pickled cabbage nice little heap of it a generous sprinkling of furikake of choice and finally some very thinly sliced green onion i sliced my green onion on a steep thin bias to get this shape and there she is a beautiful bowl of kurikatsu could not be more lovely just looking at this i feel like a proud father watching my bowl of curikatsu graduate college i'm shedding a tear and wait a minute now i'm hungry it's time to eat wow take a look at this good flower that's something special right there oh my god this one has been soaking in sauce and i bet you it's still crunchy where is everybody i'm not here anymore mama vikram kendrick weirdly enough i don't feel alone that was an ethereal experience i think that i met what looked to be some form of a deity let's talk about how this literally just blew my pants clear off of my body the curry softness is utterly ridiculous and it wouldn't be made possible without all the perfect spices the harmony of cooking it gently perfectly beautifully caramelizing those onions perfectly but more specifically that msg bringing it home this is ridiculous i mean the crunch you heard it it's delectable it's rich and yet cleansing at the same time the chew of the rice brings it all together this is easily one of the greatest dishes of all time and this is one of the best ways that you will ever make it take it or leave it pal you want to know what else is full of hot ladlings of sauce and crunchy dreams b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our curry cut so it came out i want to kiss that and you want to know what else i want to kiss i want to kiss ajinamoto for sponsoring today's video remember if you want to learn more about msg go to nomsg.com aside from this just being a sponsorship this is something that's important to me obviously i don't use msg in every single dish i make because you know some things are about technique and some things are about just leveraging a certain flavor that you want right it's about using it as a spice it's a tool and it's perfectly safe to eat and i want to help dispel this sort of confusion and mystery around it okay so click the link in the description and educate yourself now back to this curry katsu i really don't know what to say other than like the sauce perfect the pork perfect the rice perfect everything was delectable oh of course the pickles too right you could use any pickle you want bread and butter pickles on there dang every single element of this dish needs to be focused on and given your full attention i don't want the pork katsu and the curry sauce to be perfect but then the rice be mushy okay remember the rule wash your gat dang rats now with all that being said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see

three times new york times bestseller three weeks in a row bro go on get it it's been too dang long i know you've been waiting for it christmas is coming around it's 40 off on amazon the link's in the description go let's make it a four times times 10 40 times i didn't go to college okay so today we're making mcdonald's hand pies i guess they just call them pies they're hand pies they're like bar pie bars i don't know they used to be good when they fried them it's been so long since i've been to a mcdonald's that i didn't even realize that they don't fry their pies anymore so we're gonna do both iterations and with each of those give mcdonald's a nice little spanking so with all that said let's make this shall we wow already back at mac nano glad to be back and by glad i mean i'm not at all we're integrating a new system here a new but better system if you will let me make sure no one's behind me welcome to the three-point vibe check yes it is a three-point rating system in which we will digest how this business is doing before we even taste it oh there's somebody behind me the first one is the building honestly not bad nice and clean the outside is looking not drab i would say the paint looks fresh so i'll give that a 10 out of 12. hi uh can i get three apple pies all right do you guys still have the fried ones or no no the fried pies no we don't have that anymore we're like pumpkin at the moment okay that sounds good yeah i'm confused by his answer i was like do you have the fried ones and he's like nope just apple and pumpkin okay sure jesus christ oh my god hello thank you you too so the menu we all already know at the menu is horrible zero out of a million thank you okay the last number of our three-point system service you know mcdonald's has always prided themselves on the speed of their service so speed very good the vibe kind of sad which i get honestly i respect that overall experience it was fast so i'll give it a five out of seven point twenty three four which is pretty good it would be higher if they were nicer like happy to see me but i i wouldn't be happy to see me if i pulled up so we've got the bag yet again mcdonald's is doing their weird sort of bauhaus designs what is this can somebody tell me what this is please you did not think this was a burger baker don't combine modern art in fast food all right just don't okay so we've got this they don't make the fried ones anymore apparently which is a huge bummer this is where you decided to make things healthier was the apple pie all right we're in the boardroom meeting frank come on what are we doing what do you think the burgers are for we're not taking the burger away apple pie great idea frank this probably has the same amount of calories as the fried ones do can we get a check on that here's the fried here's the baked ones okay smells like pie that's good oh these look pretty good this actually looks surprisingly good i'm kind of shocked this is the first time that at mcdonald's i've eaten something and been like that's not horrible good job on this one crispy on the outside the only thing i don't like is after you start to chew on it for a little bit it turns into a bit of a glue and then kind of seals your mouth shut and then you're like god am i ever gonna be able to inhale again but aside from that it's not bad a little bit of sugar pastry is more dry than the mojave desert but the filling makes up for it but you know also apple pie should make you go wow we're gonna make you go wow okay before we even talk grassy we must first make our filling there's no reason to over complicate this so we'll keep it simple start off with four fuji apples these were absolute units and they don't always come this big so do your best to find the biggest that you can peel all those fillers then cheek them people keep getting confused when i say cheat i don't mean like cheeks as in papa's cheeks but rather taking your apple cutting as close to the stem as possible without getting the core and repeating that on all four sides it eliminates the necessity for a corer but if you have one well then golly gee go use it anyway dice that bad boy into one inch cubes keep them even unless you want unbelievably unevenly cooked apples wow that was a tongue twister unbelievably unevenly cooked apples place all that in a large sauce pot then add half a cup or 106 grams of granulated white sugar half a cup or 95 grams of packed light brown sugar stir all that together and let that sit for eight minutes this is called not to be confused [Music] place the pan over medium high heat and add 2 teaspoons or 4 grams of ground cinnamon half a teaspoon or 1 gram of ground allspice a tiny pinch of salt in the juice of one lemon let the come to a simmer then a vigorous boil then reduce the temp to medium low and let that simmer for 7 to 10 minutes or until most of the juices have been reduced out then in a bowl mix together 1 tablespoon of 9 grams of corn starch 2 tablespoons or 21 grams of water then once combined pour that slurry into your pie filling and stir until nice and thick turn off the heat and let the cool to room temperature it should look glossy and beautiful like a candy apple red lamborghini except like not red and uh it's apple pie filling but you know next we must discuss the crust look it seems mcdonald's is using a shortening based pie crust which a simple answer to make that better is by being a real homie and using butter you have two options a flaky butter pie crust or if you're gonna be a naughty apple pie baker then you would use puff pastry first a flaky all butter pie crust start off with two and a half cups or 375 grams of all-purpose flour place it in a food processor along with two teaspoons or 10 grams of sugar and one and a half teaspoons or 10 grams of fine sea salt wait josh that's too much salt shut up i'm tired of under-salted pie crust okay it's a thing it really is pulls it together till combined then add three quarters of a cup or 168 grams of unsalted butter that's been cut into three quarter inch cubes make sure this stuff is ice cold pulse it a few times until you get a nice mix and match of crumbles now most of the butter pieces should be about the size of a pea but it's totally fine if you got a cup of chunkers in there now place it in a bowl and gradually add six to eight tablespoons or 80 to 110 grams of ice water keep mixing with a fork until everything comes together then begin kneading until you get a smooth dough now you need to do that pretty quickly don't over knead this or your butter will incorporate into the dough you'll lose all the flaky qualities while simultaneously losing what could have been a kiss right on your forehead shape that into a disc wrap in plastic wrap give it some personality nice and place in the fridge for at least one hour but ideally overnight now for the puff pastry yes you can and i recommend making your own although it's a lengthy process and i already have a video on it so let's jump to the moment of truth we're gonna make these two ways obviously the dumb baked version and of course due to popular demand we are resurrecting the fried version for the big version roll out a sheet of puff pastry or your pie dough here i'm using puff pastry so it's about a quarter inch thick and a nice wide rectangle cut that dough into two and a half inch by four and a half inch rectangles like so repeat that with all of your dough then simply brush half of those rectangles with a border of egg wash consisting of one beaten egg and a splash of water grand tilde you should get about 12 to 14 rectangles with my pie dough or my puff pastry dough or store-bought puff pastry begin to do it then add one heaping tablespoon of your filling carefully in the center of the ones that have been egg washed now make sure it doesn't go to the edge unless you like your pie filling farting out the other end top with another equally sized rectangle seal the edges nicely avoiding any air getting trapped in there trim any major excess off if necessary then place on a parchment-lined baking sheet then repeat with all your little pies to create a small pie army ready and willing to fight for flavor and respect using a sharp knife make four slits along the length of the dough like so now hold your horse's pal pop those in the fridge to chill for 10 minutes then while those are chilling in a small bowl combine half a cup or 100 grams of granulated sugar 1.5 teaspoons or 5 grams of ground cinnamon half a teaspoon or 2 grams of garam masala and just a pinch of fresh grated nutmeg give that some whiskey business for the sparklies that live among us now you can give your pies a nice brushing with your egg wash sprinkle with a generous amount of your cinnamon sugar across the top and pop into an oven that was preheated to 400 degrees fahrenheit or 205 celsius for 20 to 25 minutes or until a gorgeous borderline shining hand pie emerges ready to grant you all your deepest desires now before we crack into these let me quickly touch on the fried ones it's the exact same filling process brush the rectangles with a border of egg wash hopefully you know your shapes by now add your filling top with another and pitch the edges shut the only difference is you will not be making slits and nor will you be adding egg wash for obvious reasons now all you need to do is get yourself a five quart pot fill it halfway up with vegetable oil and heat it to 360 degrees fahrenheit or 180 celsius then gently lay in three to four pies at a time and fry for three to five minutes flipping halfway through or until they reach a lovely golden brown pull them out pop in a wire rack to drain just for a couple of seconds then immediately toss in cinnamon sugar that we made for the baked ones you gotta toss it while it's hot or it won't stick it's simple uh i guess science and yes this is essentially a churro apple hand pie what more could you possibly want from me a kiss ha fat chance just kidding anyway repeat with the rest of your hand pies and just enjoy the experience of life when you bite into it which is exactly what we're gonna do right now now let's taste test and first to point out that we've obviously won but more specifically if a fried or baked version is better visually i will say there's this pretty good look really good work there so shout out time for mine we get a sound check i've got my mic here so holy what about the fried one that sounds soft yet crisp all right we'll go with the baked version may him shine down call me let the rays of flavor drench me and please forgive me for i have busted that is something special right there what i just put in my mouth i'm not gonna put the other one in my mouth that should not be that good that's too much the answer is that they lost twice two times in a row they lost i don't even need to explain it so let's get our taste tester in for the day back by popular demand kendrick young baby yeah whoa he's here today yeah we have two pies ready to be in the mouth are you ready would you like me to feed you always oh we just touched hands yeah our hands touched that looks nice number one what are you doing all right number two okay i like the first one better request of the first one the texture is great second one it's a little dry mcdonald's you need to chill out i didn't say it was mcdonald's how do you know it's mcdonald's i know got another surprise for you is this the fried one mcdonald's you need to start frying apple pies again i feel like if they still fried their apple pies they would have a fighting chance not saying they would win but they'd have a fighting chance the outside is crisp the inside is just fluffy and that apple filling is just like a yeah obviously choosing a better product when you make a filling or a jam is gonna be better and fresher wow we won yet again episode i haven't seen my eyes in it i want the rest of the pie yeah you can have it it's a little hot yet again mcdonald's easy to step up their game we woke them up today i hope you wake yourselves up by making this pie it will change your life as many of the other things do thank you i don't know where to go you want to know what else has hot glistening juices oozing from a steaming pocket b-roll [Music] our guys in that is it so we made our mcdonald's pies a fried version a baked version and we slapped them in the face both times dude the point i want to make on this video is that their pies always sucked that was pretty much it i don't know why you would go to mcdonald's to get a pie you're not saving yourself time i guess you're saving yourself money but for like how much money you're really saving just go to a bakery and like pick up a slice of pie honestly like a grocery store could do a better job than this i don't know why i'm directing you go somewhere else because guess what you got the freaking recipe right here dude so you know what to do and with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you [Music] you

something and you're just like i'd like a briefcase of that whether you answered yes or no this is the place for that okay so we are making baklava if you have never had this before or you've seen it before and not eaten it now is the time of course if you've had it before and you've never made it wow you see how these things just kind of come together perfectly just like our sponsors at crate and barrel this is one of my favorite places of all time to shop i shop there for much of my kitchen essentials they have a wide selection of everything from all cloud pans to the most stunning little 9x13 baking pans that we happen to be using in today's video and along with many of the other tools that are from creighton barrel in today's video i want to just go in there and take a little nap i don't know if they would let me cringe barrel so by going to crate barrel or visiting the link in the description you can make your 2021 holiday picture perfect with everything you need for your favorite recipe or even just a gift for your loved ones so visit your nearest creighton barrel or the link in the description and from creighton barrel and myself we kiss you and now to discuss the recipe so baklava is a pretty simple concept it looks really intricate honestly it's very very straightforward it's extremely easy of course you can make your adobe you really actually don't have to in this event so we're doing two different versions of baklava one that's a turkish style and one that's a great style but the bare necessities of what it is thin layers of dough filo pastry a layer of nuts more filo pastry a whole lot of butter and it's baked soaked in a sugar syrup and it's amazing and it's a textural wonderland of crispity crunchy layers and the most decadent sugary chew of your life so with all that said let's make this shall we so although these dainty little pastries look complicated they're much more simple than you think there's only one element that we must discuss the phyllo pastry now look this can be made from scratch does it make a massive difference well it can i do feel that most people will mess it up because if they're not thin enough then you end up with sheets of drywall which is not good to make your own get six cups or 900 grams of all-purpose flour in a large bowl make a nice little well in there and add one and a half cups or 372 grams of hot water 2 teaspoons or 23 grams of white vinegar the juice of one lemon and 1 tablespoon or 11 grams of olive oil mix it together by hand until you get a shaggy dough then knead that for about 5 minutes or until very smooth now wrap your little man in plastic wrap give him life and a personality of course and let that rest for about 15 minutes from there you'll divide your dough into 25 evenly sized pieces and as i've said about a billion times weighing your dough and dividing that gram weight by the total number of pieces will get you the most accurate amount now all you need to do is roll each of these as thin as physically possible the best way i've found to do that is to run it through a pasta roller while constantly flowering generously until you get a sheet that's so thin you can see your hand through it yummy thin fabric for dessert dust with flour generously and repeat with all of your dough now let me just say i understand that it's a bit of a lengthy process so if you want to skip the feeling of an ego boost that comes with making your own then of course you can use store-bought okay i'll allow it first we have our pistachio version which is more of like a turkish style start with two cups for 454 grams of unsalted butter put it on the stove over medium heat then it'll start to simmer a bit some of the milk salts will get foamy and flow to the top gently skim those off as it rises and let that cook until any remaining milk solid sinks to the bottom and begin to toast and the butter looks super clear once it's done gently pour that through a mesh trainer lined with cheesecloth into a heatproof container and guess what you've got yummy for your tummy next in a food processor add two and a half cups or 350 grams of shelled raw pistachios pulse that several times until you get it broken up nicely now you don't want huge chunks but you also don't want to find powder say like medium smallish almost slightly finer than gravel set that to the side then grab yourself a 9x13 baking dish which i love this one this one is brush the bottom and the sides of your baking dish with ghee add in one sheet of filo pastry brush that with ghee then add another sheet of filo pastry brush that with ghee then add another sheet of filo pastry see what's going on here you're gonna repeat the process of brushing with butter and adding a sheet until you've added about 14 layers of butter brushed phyllo upon your 14th layer give it another tender brushing then evenly disperse all of your nuts across the surface dip your brush into your paint of flavor and power and just kind of flick some of it across your pistachios to soak in evenly then add another 14 layers of ghee brushed pillow filo ghee filo gee feel once that's done get a very sharp knife cut into four even strips lengthwise be sure to cut all the way to the bottom then from there cut diagonally across the entire pastry from one end to the other to create a beautifully diamond-shaped baklava piece i mean look at this thing it looks like freaking armor dude pour a little of your remaining butter onto that then pop that into an oven set to 400 fahrenheit for about 30 to 35 minutes don't mind that other baklava we'll talk about that in a second while that's baking let's make our syrup combine two and a half cups or 470 grams of granulated sugar half a cup or 96 grams of muscovado sugar and one and a quarter cup or 415 milliliters of water then add a one inch piece of lemon peel in the juice of half a lemon set that over medium high then let that boil for about eight to ten minutes or until it reaches a loose syrup consistency it should still look a little watery but you know slightly thickened once your baklava is done baking pull her out and pour all of your syrup over the entire pan it'll do a little dance for you all right because of the sweet joys you've doused it in and so what you'll do is optionally sprinkle on some additional very finely ground pistachio on top of each little piece place it in a wire rack to cool completely and you can go do a little dance because this is going to be busting once it's done cooling next up we have a walnut greek version this is pretty much an identical process except this time you're going to use two and three quarters of a cup or 250 grams of walnuts pulse those until you get something just a touch finer than before and to that you'll add one tablespoon or eight grams of cinnamon powder one teaspoon or two grams of allspice and just a touch of fresh grated nutmeg mix that together until thoroughly combined in place to decide now yet again we're going to do our layering but this time we're not going to clear fire butter i find that it works just fine and creates a bit of a more brown butter flavor that bodes very well with the whole thing but if you want to clarify it then you can do that both ways still get a case anyway again 14 layers of butter brush phyllo and for that you'll need about 350 grams of melted butter for the record then add your spicy nuts a little flick of your butter onto your nuts trying to be serious add on your filo which is on top of your nuts butter brush filo for another 14 layers and this time we'll just cut these into simple rectangles as big or as small as you want although i do prefer a one by one or a one and a half by one and a half inch size and then pop that guy into your 400 degree oven for about 30 to 35 minutes and then it's shut up time to your sauce pot add half a cup or 97 grams of granulated sugar 1 cup or 110 grams of water a pinch of fine sea salt 1 cinnamon stick 2 orange peel strips and 1 cup or 282 grams of honey set that to medium high bring them to a boil then reduce to medium and let that reduce for about 5 to 7 minutes or until it reaches a very light syrup consistency don't take out the aromatics yet relax let that infuse while you wait for the baklava to finish baking and you should know the drill here unless you skipped this part which you didn't right anyway pour all that syrup atop your baklava do a little dancy dance and let that cool completely now what do you do at this point josh well darn tim what do you think we gonna do we're gonna put this in our mouth and masticate it so we have two different baklava right here one that is a greek style and one that is a turkish style similar and yet very very different if you've never had baklava before it's ultra crispy ultra crunchy and it's got a chew to it in a way hello oh wow that is excellent the crunch the layers of crunch it's like you're in a skyscraper there's a big beautiful elevator and you're going down in the most comfortable luxurious way as possible but it's your mouth that's the cascading texture of this crunch followed by your mouth being overwhelmed with the rich honey syrup the spices i'm having the greek one by the way and the walnuts i mean it's just a textural and flavored journey now next is the turkish style oh [Music] good lord this is a perfect dessert it really is this isn't even from italy and i want to give it up they both have the same beauty and yet they're completely different if you prefer something more spiced or you want something almost fall flavored even though it's not really supposed to be fall flavored then the greek one is going to be for you if you want something more simplified in flavor more singular very pistachio nut forward then obviously the turkish one would be for you these are ridiculously easy to make and there's no reason that you shouldn't be making them now if you want to make your own dough do understand that it will take four times longer that's up to you but now you got to make it are you stuck on the syrup you want to know what else does a little dancy dance when introduced to hot syrup b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our baklava it came out absolutely beautiful but first i have to say a massive thank you to our

Spaghetti and meatballs should be an unforgettable...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, spaghetti and meatballs now i trigger some memories for you and you go to a restaurant mommy and daddy order it for you and you didn't realize that it was this much per plate when you could be having it for this much that is but cheaper [Music] oh well while you're here you should order my book you've not already look at how much of a good time we're having if you haven't ordered this what is wrong with you it's gone to a number one new york times bestseller 40 off on amazon the link is in the description go on and get it look at this what did we open up to little fishy and cubanos take a little night with some cubanos all right now go on scram [Music] okay so we all know the classic spaghetti and meatballs but what do you think it is it's spaghetti and meatballs but it's not just spaghetti and meatballs it's about the pasta it's about the sauce and it's about the meatballs and there's only three main components that make up what it is so you better believe that those three components should be perfect in essence they should be utterly full of flavor and anything less than that ruins the entire dish and yet people are sitting back and enjoying a plate of spaghetti and meatballs that subpar when you don't even realize that you're ruining your life disgusting you should be ashamed but today we're gonna fix that so with all that said let's make this shall we we've had this discussion before oh josh's homemade pasta cheaper or a store-bought pasta cheaper look here's the short answer but kind of long yes you can get your flour your eggs mix them together and that dough is less expensive than buying pasta but unless you have the buying power to get yourself a pasta roller with the spaghetti attachment you're to be hard-pressed for it to be very good so if that's an issue to you then i would advise you to go to the store on that one but it'd be a whole lot cooler if you made your own also this pasta dough was in my book not the flex but it literally is the number one new york times bestseller and i know i'm plugging it but the link is in the bio papa anyway let's make our big juicy balls great meatballs don't need to be complicated they just need a touch of technique some essential ingredients and maybe an individual that gives a about what they're doing for themselves for once so for the quarter pound of ham in this case i used mortadella which is slightly pricier and also not him i would recommend going with him if you want to save the cash chop that bad boy finally and place in a medium sized bowl to that bowl you'll add one pound of ground beef oh wow dangly one teaspoon of finely ground fennel seed one and a half teaspoons of fine sea salt three cloves of garlic that have been finely chopped a quarter cup of fresh grated pecan oil or parmesan cheese fresh cracked black pepper to taste give that a good mix to incorporate then add half a cup of panko bread crumbs and one whole egg mix it together and knead for about one minute until emulsified and tacky look a good forced meat like this should have a little bounce to it almost jiggle you know you want that thing banging this should make 20 meatballs so get yourself a large cookie scoop and scoop out as many chunks as you can onto a small sheet tray i used the wrong scoop so i ended up with 19. good job josh anyway roll those meaty men into nice balls now get yourself a large saute pan heat that over medium high with just enough oil to cook the bottom of the pan and once it's hot add all your meatballs in a single layer so it's not overcrowded and sear for about two minutes flip and sear on one or two more sides until you get some browning all over now they likely are still a little raw on the inside that's good we don't want them cooked all the way through yet so stay calm place your balls on a plate or the meatballs on a plate reduce your heat to medium add 4 cloves of thinly sliced garlic saute for about a minute or till fragrant then add one teaspoon of red pepper flakes saute that for 30 seconds then add 12 oz can of crushed tomatoes stir everything together season a taste of salt and just a pinch of sugar to curb its acidic qualities then add your meatballs bring to a simmer over medium heat reduce the heat to medium low and simmer for 5 to 8 minutes now halfway through that you're gonna add one bunch of basil that's been lightly bruised and of course let it continue to finish cooking until your meatballs are cooked through and the sauce is slightly reduced now at this point you need to make sure that your sauce is seasoned perfectly with salt you always need more than you think okay so you got your sauce up dare i say basta balls now for your spaghetti but wait reserve about one cup of your meatball sauce to the side for extra saucing you never know people love to complain so chances are they'll complain about not having an extra sauce wow so thoughtful of you season a pot of water generously with salt and bring to a boil over medium-high obviously fresh noodles will cook in like 30 seconds but if you're using store bought then you'll add those guys and let them cook until al dente which is usually like 30 seconds under most of the recommended times once it's done instead of draining your pasta peppa recommends that you use tongs to pick up big bunches of pasta letting it drain slightly and adding it to your saucy balls until all of your pasta has been added this will incorporate some of that pasta water which is a good thing matter of fact when it's all added maybe add a couple small splashes of extra pasta water now toss all that together until everything is coated evenly and beautifully and now you're ready to serve to serve wind up a good portion of pasta place it in a plate or shallow bowl add some additional sauce for those who complain add on at least four meatballs per plate depending on your vibe some additional sauce optionally hit that with some first graded pecarina or parmesan or well more specifically for about cheaper parmesan and finally some chiffonade fresh basil this is a lot of pasta so i would say this makes about five generous servings but you could easily serve more if the portions are smaller i actually made this a smaller serving for the sake of presentation so expect a serving to be much larger than this and more specifically for this price bro i mean look if that doesn't get you going then this tasting probably will i didn't really think that through when i played in this get on over there you funny man this much per bowl come on this is a generous bowl but come on this is how much is left dude you paid as much for this as one little plate so i think we should obviously try a meatball by itself oh my lord this ball in my mouth i'm about to bust we always need to do our uh mic's a little far away i'm just gonna it's okay i'll walk over it's okay [Applause] i want a lady in the this somebody hold one of these balls while i kiss with the spaghett butt cheaper or not this is a perfect bowl of spaghetti and meatballs from top to bottom the spaghetti cooked perfectly it's got that chew to it the sauce a little spicy all right not too much i'm tired of people doing oh i'm gonna put eight teaspoon of red pepper flakes why don't you just relax for a second take a step back and realize that you should never do that you're doing nothing you're pretending that you like spicy it's okay just don't put any this is perfect but cheaper or not and the price is ridiculously low you don't even have to make your own pasta you could be enjoying the best bowl of spaghetti and meatballs of your entire life for the cheapest you will in your entire life what more could you possibly want story has been foretold brother you want to know what else has papa's red hot saucy meaty meatballs glistening in front of your eyes [Music] okay so we made ours let's just be honest it was perfectly executed it looks stunning the sauce glistening the balls rotund what more can i say and for such a simple price of this much per serving i mean that's pretty gosh thing look at that wow just look at doing a little dance wow what did we learn something doesn't need to be expensive to be delicious and beautiful and that's how it always has been on this show so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time i'm gonna move the dang road that's what it is i'm gonna call the state and i'm like move

your life whether you say yes or no this could be that moment for you [Music] so we're talking about slurping noodles right you know what else is good to slurp a hot perfect cup of coffee or cold i

forget to click my link to take the quiz and get your first bag today okay so today we are making yaki udon if you've never had it before it's it's familiar in a way most people have had some form of a noodle that is like yahudan it is one of my favorite noodle dishes of all time and if you've never had it before now is the time it takes 15 minutes to make i'm sick and tired of people being like oh i'll just go and get it or order it to go or whatever enough is enough just go get a walk keep it in your pantry and then when you want to make this noodle dish put it together in little to no time little to no time i refuse to believe that there are many restaurants that you're going out to that are making them traditionally or properly or just taking the time to put love into it and you're accepting a subpar quality product it's not right you get where i'm going with this so with all that said let's make this shall we as previously explained welcome to the easiest noodle dish of your life class is in session first thing we need to get together is papa's proprietary really simple in a small bowl combine two tablespoons or 35 grams of palm sugar microplaning is great no pun intended but it'd be a whole lot faster if you just chop it real fine it's okay if it doesn't all dissolve it's going to dissolve when you put it in the final dish then add 2 tablespoons or 29 grams of dark soy sauce optionally 2 tablespoons or 29 grams of shiradashi link in the description for that 1 tablespoon or 12 grams of rice vinegar 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of mirin two tablespoons or 28 grams of oyster sauce and as usual give that a nice little whiskey for your little babies before we even start let's talk noodles can you make your own udon noodles yes of course and i will say that i've found that fresh udon noodles at most asian grocery stores are oftentimes better than what you could make at home that is if you don't want to take the time in this case local asian grocery store fresh noodles specifically are papa approved anyway get a pot of lightly salted water boiling pop in one pound of fresh udon noodles let those cook for about 30 seconds then immediately drain and run under cold water until completely cool give them a light toss and just a couple teaspoons of sesame oil to keep them from sticking and place your thick noodles to the side now for the veg you're gonna need about one cup of baby trumpet mushrooms slice those guys into quarter inch thick slices lengthwise then get yourself about one cup of rough chopped cabbage snack a sweet onion cut off the bottom and the top cut it in half then remove the peel and do some thick juliennes for just half of the onion all these were about half an inch thick like so you can save the other half for stock or throw it at whoever doesn't season their tomatoes next you'll need three green onions cut off the hairy bottoms sounds gross then cut into one inch segments alright it's walk time what do we do literally every time before we use our wok folks wrong wrong or maybe right i don't actually know what you said we need to do a quick season on it pour in just enough oil to get a thin layer on the bottom heat that over high heat swirling the pan constantly and once it starts to smoke cut off the heat discard the hot oil and wipe it out with a paper towel now look at that that looks like a got dang marble and it should look like that every time now heat that over medium high with just a touch of oil until it's hot hot if you touch that your soul will leave your body then add half a pound or 225 grams of ground pork press it so you get some nice surface area contact and let that sear until you get some decent browning about two minutes flip and sear for another minute then begin chopping and stir frying until a good amount of its fat has rendered and it's getting nice little quiffy bits all up in there about another two minutes remove that and place it aside now add three tablespoons or 42 grams of duck fat continue heating over medium-high by the way you can use vegetable oil that's fine then once it's extremely hot add your onyo and mush woom stir fry that for about two minutes or till soften and you get some lovely color on those you want dark browns okay then add your cabbage and green onion stir-fry for one more minute so it begins to wilt and get a little color but let me make a quick point here i still want some crunch alright i don't want mushy ass cabbage now add your meat back along with the noodles season lightly with a pinch of ground white pepper salt and a small pinch of stir fry that bad boy for about two minutes really get in there you want that classic good old-fashioned wok hay then add your yaki udon sauce and stir-fry for another minute really get that action all right don't you be scared brother or hot that flame is there to help you that's your friend also be careful thank you once that's done cut off the heat add three cloves of finely chopped garlic gently toss together to not break up the noodles and serve immediately plop it into a bowl optionally you can hit that bad boy with bonito flakes sesame seeds in some thinly sliced green onion now she's already looking lovely but if you want to be extra naughty you can always add some spicy chili crisp or your favorite chili oil but enough tantalizing your thoughts let's taste test this bad boy and see if this 15-minute stir-fry tastes like a multi-course menu seeded atop the most beautiful snow-capped mountain in the most beautiful region of japan wow it's time to eat first stop wait what's that sound alexa stop all right we're starting over first off alexa was running and kendrick didn't let me say the abc's in totality listen it's okay you don't have to talk about it so moving this into a separate bowl because i want everyone to be able to have a little taste and i'm sure they don't want pepper all over it [Music] so noodles meat vegetables sauce it's a classy combo almost like a chow mein but with udon noodles sort of similar bro this should not be this good the noodles the umami the depth of flavor i mean this is everything that you want in a bowl of noodles and you can put this together in what 15 minutes i'm sick and tired but people constantly complaining oh i don't have to do this component and then put it in this pot and then okay you know what first off go take a nap better yet you know what no go take a lap there's a bar right there come back and make these noodles and then you can stop complaining and be happy for once i've just received word that vikram and kendrick are noodle guys they would like to have this be in their mouth now come have oh my gosh you did the sound effect again oh that's what you're just eating the goddamn noodles i can't believe you're eating it with a fork um i swallowed that hole that's better than the chow mein i usually am kind of iffy on cabbage but for whatever reason that napa cabbage got like good flavor for how fast you were able to put this together this was amazing wait no i wanted some you wanna know what else has papa's hot noodles ready to be forklifted into your home on the daily [Music] all right guys and that is it before i even get started let me just say a massive thank you to our partners at trade coffee for sponsoring today's video don't forget to click the link

getting a quick and easy meal you know something like a chow mein dish or any sort of like stir-fried noodle dish i can't keep letting people do that without them understanding that it can be made just as good but more often than not much better for little to no time and it's not that expensive it's really not just take the freaking time one of the greatest noodle dishes of all time and it's

talking about texas roadhouse dinner rolls maybe everybody doesn't know this one but a lot of people who have experienced it myself included i've had these before believe it or not look they're pretty good not gonna lie i'm not gonna sit here and try and tell you a fairy tale but i don't like them they're good i get the hype on this one this is one of the few times that i will get the hype on it now am i gonna hop on the hype train no it's just wrong okay anytime you hop on the hype train it's a bad thing it just never lives up to the true hype there's always a better alternative and that's what but better is all about so with all that said let's make this shall we wow we're here the road house hell yeah america god damn it now get your rolls now put your goddamn cowboy boots on zip your pants up and get to eating might want to unbuckle your belt wow it is crowded good god why i just want rolls well they should be pumping them out then right can i just get the rolls to go for the record the people that i met at the restaurant that said hello if i seemed annoyed i'm really sorry i just like was looking for the roles first i'm like hey where do i go for it to go and they go oh go over here and i go over there there's nobody over there so i go back and i'm like hey there's nobody over there and then they're like all right we'll send someone over and i'm like okay cool and then there's nobody there still and then i just see them all congregated talking and i'm like cool i don't want to disrupt this conversation you can just grab me a couple rolls and i'll be out of here and then i go back over nobody shows up and they're like all right we'll send someone so they finally send someone and i'm like oh  i forgot my wallet gotta grab my wallet real quick i forgot about it they peek in i'm not there so like oh there's nobody here that needs to be serviced so they go back to their station i come back there's still nobody there and i'm like yo and they're like did you get your rolls and i'm like no i didn't get like rolls and then they're like i always watch a video they just came inside looking for you yeah i went to go grab my wallet just give me the balls give me the rules but also hello very sorry about that okay we're gonna eat these fresh so we're gonna go drive somewhere real quick give them a little taste test then we'll make them simple nimble right we have a roll smells very sweet feels good smells like store-bought bread this is a butt better first these are actually pretty pretty good i'm not gonna lie from time to time one of my guilty pleasures is texas roadhouse i'm not gonna sit here and act like i'm so special that i'm immune to the allure of texas roadhouse do i know how they make it good no not exactly but i have an idea this is hard for my ego to let go of they're soft they're nice we all know the honey butter's nice and sweet there's something about these everybody thinks that they're impossibly good and to impossibilities i sing nay are you gonna eat that cause i'm gonna eat it that's okay well yeehaw folks we're making a roll worthy of a good old-fashioned bus okay that's that's about as much of that voice i can stomach for this one right so this is real simple you start with a dough wow who would have guessed it buddy first snag yourself a medium-sized saucepan and add 465 grams of whole milk don't complain to me about grams we're doing this right okay papa geese though place it on the stove over medium high and as soon as that comes to a full boil cut the heat pour it into a bowl set over an ice bath and cool just until it reaches a lukewarm temperature you've now scalded your milkies which helps prevent the dough from losing strength now once it's cooled down enough combine that with 120 grams of filtered water get that mixture to about 95 degrees fahrenheit and add three and one quarter teaspoon or eight grams of instant yeast stir to dissolve and set to the side in the bowl of stand mixer add 1050 grams of all-purpose flour 110 grams of granulated sugar and 2 teaspoons or 14 grams of fine sea salt optionally you can also add about an eighth teaspoon which is just a tiny pinch of diastatic melt powder again optional it just helps a little bit with color and flavor really mix it all together pop on your dough hook spiral thing dough spiral whatever start mixing over medium speed and stream in 50 grams of unsalted butter that's just barely melted to a liquid state i've said this before i don't want it to be hot otherwise it'll kill the yeast and you'll never receive a geese from papa's flower dusted lips again once all that's incorporated add your [Music] yummy along with two whole large eggs obviously not their shell and for all you bakers out there that officially puts this at around 65 to 68 hydration for any amount of this dough pretty much every single time you make these regardless of the batch size let that mix until it forms a lovely dough that no longer sticks to the sides of the bowl pull that brother out give it a few extra needs till it's real smooth then pop it into a large greased bowl cover with plastic wrap and let that rise for 1.5 to 2 hours at room temp or until doubled now while that's rising we're going to make the coveted cinnamon honey butter oh but wait that's a little different it's a charred cinnamon and vanilla bean honey butter my ego is inflating already so first get yourself two to three cinnamon sticks and either with a blowtorch or a broiler lightly char them on two sides let them cool then break them into little pieces toss them in a blender and blend on maximum speed until you get a very fine powder now in a medium-sized bowl add three quarters of a cup or 168 grams of salted fully softened butter not unsalted okay salted hit that with an additional quarter teaspoon of fine sea salt a pinch of fine ground black pepper two teaspoons or seven grams of charred cinnamon powder i like to pass mine through a sieve just a pinch of fresh grated nutmeg in the beans of half a vanilla bean pot give it a good whisk until very smooth then whisk in a quarter cup or 30 grams of powdered sugar whisk nice and vigorously to incorporate some air and you'll end up with a beautifully smooth butter that's so smooth it could sweep you off your feet even with the worst pickup line you've ever heard in your life okay back to the dough we forgot to give this one a personality because uh to be honest i couldn't find the sharpie so i'm very sorry about that but if it did have a personality with opinions love and candor then take that plastic wrap off give it a tender loving stroke and then punch every last molecule of life out of it for having an opinion pour it out onto a lightly floured work surface now listen up i wanted to shape these into balls but i decided to test out the classic rectangle texas roadhouse cut first off hated it i've always hated it and i still hate it so let's make these look nice if you're making a whole batch cut them into 40 even pieces you can get the exact gramage of what that would be by weighing the whole dough and dividing that by 40. it's simple mathematics oh wait i suck at math is this right now once you have your pieces shape those balls by rolling around in circles while maintaining board contact constantly and you'll get a doit little ball pop them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper cover them with plastic wrap and let them proof for 20 minutes at room temp remove the plastic wrap give them a light spritz with water and immediately place into an oven set to 375 for 15 to 18 minutes or until they emerge absolutely lovely like these fellas right here immediately brush those with melted butter each and every voluptuous bun and finally give them a nice finishing sprinkle of smoked flaky salt yes smoked trust me all right you want texas here welcome ticks buddy now what do you do at this point josh uh you eat them immediately you see the beautiful striking appeal to these buns in the first place isn't just that they're good but it's eating them hot out of the oven that is the biggest part and it's what makes them so undeniably good so let's slather on our fragrant butter or fragrant butt for short and see how we did first off the butters look at this look at the color of this this looks like lifeless breeze into it and this is just desaturated butter taste test of my butter i do like their butter i will say that and this is where you realize wait a minute this was never that good to begin with the main event though [Music] i have a couple things to say about this textually it's actually not significantly better hang on though it is a little bit better now flavor-wise this is a perfect representation of how much better the flavor is this is the texas roadhouse flavor and that's my flavor and i think it all comes down to using real butter real ingredients but more specifically giving it love making love to it don't do that all in all if you want an improved product it's not that much harder to just make your own obviously but we gotta get a little bit of the butter on there [Music] that's stupid that should be illegal kendrick we just eat this i want everyone's this is too good i want everybody's reaction on this oh what did we just do with this wow wow we already know uh that i think that i won here of course we have a new taste tester that you guys haven't seen before ulysses please come to the stage this guy's a total jokester something's not all the way there i don't know what it is this was a stand-in by the way this one's cold so don't be scared alright are you scared terrified now these are both heated up so i don't want to hear anything about oh josh but you still give me the coach shut up now is my mic on yes we do we do all this stuff for you don't even got to worry about it girl here is number one no butter plain bun i'm gonna take that out of your hand now all right i i'm gonna take that out of your hand now all right jesus christ and then we've got number two all right number two you only have to take one i need to try on both at the same time okay so that was number two now here's number one i'm gonna do you want how many times you gotta try this just tell me which one's better number one okay i'm gonna butter them with their accompanying butter by the way number one was mine so we've practically already won we're gonna take it a step further one with butter why does he seem so confused today he's old all these millennials which one is it going to be which is going to be all right here's number one yep all right number one who eats like i've never seen this man eat like this in my life let's speed this up give me the other one here's number two now you can see that this yeah yeah okay that's number two why don't you take a break in between he hasn't even swallowed the first like five bites so good so two or one do you know which one's which one he doesn't even know anymore this one was good okay just the winner we got to the other end it was a beautiful day we won thank you so much ulysses if there's anything that you're gonna make from this video it doesn't even have to be the rolls just make this butter whichever you choose to make you're gonna be the winner that's just a matter of fact all right let's just end this because we're at like 30 minutes of recording thank you you want to know what else brought the road back to roadhouse b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our texas roadhouse dinner rolls how did we do yet again we did it i hope this is another learning moment where we can sit back and go wait a minute uh we can make this at home it doesn't require some fancy fangled way of doing it or is this special secret it's doable a human being can do it with their own two hands ah there's a big difference between mine and that's that they're round and they actually look nice instead of being these sort of like half hazard pillows that you pick up at like a thrift shop and you don't know where the pillow's been but you're like whatever i'm just gonna get this cause it's like five cents and then you sleep on it you're like oh you gotta go to the hospital or something you know with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time don't don't do the pillow at the thrift store just i've not done it before but just you know for like a general [Music] you

everybody stop you might have already been able to tell by the title you already know basically we hit five million subscribers five i can't even count that much i mean i can do a five on my hand at max you get one of these at one million subscribers and we have well we would have five of these now we're so thankful and grateful for every single one of you it really means the world to us we put a lot of work into this there's been a whole storyline getting to this point the storyline goes way way back and by way back i mean really actually not that long ago it's kind of shocking how fast all this has happened and it wouldn't have happened without all of you the thank you goes to you but the thank you also goes to the team behind this whole process like i said there's so much work that goes into it we started out with just me and i was doing everything by myself and then vikram came on and he solved a lot of issues now there's a whole team that makes this what it is today we've always seen youtube as like a branch of a much larger thing we want to do we have a lot of goals it's a privilege to be able to put in so much work and have people enjoy it just means the world to us so to celebrate this incredible achievement we have something very special for you first off we're going to be doing a discord stage this sunday the third at 10 a.m cst i'll see you there but not only that while we're on that stage i'm going to be answering any questions you have i want to talk to as many of you as possible i'll be on there as long as i can and we're going to give away signed copies of the book's going to be a beautiful time but back to what we were saying speaking of team since that's what makes this go all the way around we're gonna be doing a cooking challenge with me and vikram the director okay i actually have to go i have to go now so as we all know this is a cooking challenge of some sort basically the goal is that we're gonna be cooking it's a challenge but you won't be able to see what i'm doing you already know what this is there's no reason to like be like oh look we're going to surprise you when you first started working here forgive me if i'm wrong but you didn't cook my culinary expertise was warming up food in a microwave and taking frozen patties and putting in the oven now i can do more than that so we'll see how much i can actually do today we are making what could it be what do you think it is vikram i'm thinking a burrito or like a taco but i have no idea it is a taco but not just any taco it's going to be a breakfast taco i'm going easy on you or am i we all know i've never gone easy on you in your life that is true i also like how they made this shorter than usual are you guys  with vikram like leave this i'm not that short tell us some strengths some weaknesses what's gonna happen well i've never made a breakfast taco before i've gotten good at making asian food and like rice dish and stuff like that but yeah i've just never done a taco so we'll see how that goes my weakest point knife skills looking at what i'm looking at it's gonna be a lot of nice skills yeah cause i've never gone hard on anybody for evenness of cuts i think that it's gonna go well i feel like most the people that have done this have outdone what they thought they were gonna do so with all that said let's make this shall we so we have a big bowl put that on a scale victim's moving so fast already i didn't know where my scale went i'm not rushing we're gonna use 300 grams of all-purpose flour that's in zero it out again four grams of fine sea salt and then you're gonna add two grams of baking powder kind of can be deceptive in the weight of all that that is two grams grab your whisk i'm so much further behind than i thought it was just started just the scale thing got me messed up oh my gosh i always look at people doing this and i'm like how can they not keep up this is so easy and now i'm doing it i'm like i'm gonna put three quarters of a cup of water also known as 180 milliliters and then you're going to add a quarter cup of oil hold on flour my oil isn't open okay so that's done that goes into the system oh hold on okay there we go giving it a nice encouraging mix if it's too sticky just add a little bit of flour back to it and i'm just gonna start kneading this is great you know i really need you to rely on your bread making skills oh gosh my mine is not sticky yours is not sticky three quarters of a cup of water one fourth oil yes why is mine not sticky bro i don't know i didn't make the dough maybe i mismeasured the flour are we both gonna make mistakes today this looks terrible get a look at the dough vic remember the slap and fold i do i wish i could slap and fold my dough it's so stiff i'm having fun as soon as something someone's like i'm having fun it's fine man usually i don't even get this far i just throw it in the stand mixer i'm putting all my power into this yeah like look how minimal effort i'm like almost not even trying to shape it into a nice little ball you know it looks bad no it looks great bro thanks kendrick my dough is done it's looking nice and smooth in the dough container bake is your workstation clear uh it could be this is not good it just doesn't look like yours when did you see mine well every video i edit vikram has seen every single recipe we have ever made on this channel and multiple techniques i just like skip past the dough part i'm like ah i'll be fine yeah that bit me in the butt today we got two potatoes oh so just give your potatoes a nice clean wipe both sides nice and even so take your potato cut that in half and then you're going to take that half lengthwise and then you're going to cut it into sort of like plank shapes like long planks like long planks the only kind of plank you can imagine i don't really know what other planks there are in this moment you know okay and then you're then going to cut those planks into half inch cubes boom boom boom boom boom i can't really say that's a cube it should be a cube how even are they vic ah not very but it's okay i'm almost done with the second one oh my other potato mine are more rectangle i mean that's fine it's not gonna hurt the final product it's just gonna look really ugly i've missed one direction probably oh my god you watch one direction too me too put it in the pot you wanna just hand it to me i'll cover it with water for you oh i'm so nice i i'm improvising a bit here wow don't look at them that's something vikram do you know what a half inch looks like so take your tomato cut the top off the bottom off cut it in half remove that core by sort of cutting all the way around it all right oh juicy flip it over and just dice that go on for like about a half inch quarter inch it's okay if it's not perfect so much on my table diced tomato into the bowl all this stuff is scrap you can hold on to it and put it in your butt if you want hold on buddy i have the end goal in mind i know what i need to do the speed is what's messing me up i have never cut a tomato before as i'm sure everyone can tell as long as it tastes good right can i get a sheenua thanks vic i couldn't see your hand are you done with your tomato ah you could say that yeah take your chili carefully remove the seeds all right you're then going to slice it very very very thinly as thin as you possibly can how'd you get the seeds out so fast i just did i feel like in general you know when i'm slicing a chili not really looking at it but i know it's thin i wasn't looking for a damn second so that's going to go into your uh tomat i can't do it that thin as josh does but i'd say that's pretty thin he's also using my knife that's probably sharpened yeah it's got to flex a little bit oh my god an industry professional that's been doing something his entire life relaxing on somebody who's only been doing it for a year that's fair with my i'm going to dump my potatoes out vic yours are probably done so i'll strain them for you so we'll just chill these in there where where are you right now vic you got your tomatoes get your chili yeah it's in the bowl i think this is as good as i could have done without being scared to cut my finger good stuff yeah i believe you so take your cut it in half peel that first outer layer how comfy do you feel about this i feel good enough are we dicing this yes but it's going to be a fine dice i have more faith in this than i do in the tomato i'm just going to slice across the grain and we have our sliced onion that's going to go directly into my bowl boom down below or somewhere you get a lime whoa i'm still on the onion and then into your bowl you're gonna zest that beautiful lime maybe like half how are we doing are you okay this is the finest ice i've actually ever done the best for not last this is only the beginning get two cheeks out of the lime squeeze the cheeks in there vikram you've seen me make cheek so many times i swear to god if you don't know this i can do this season a taste of salt and then just give it a little stir you know combine those ingredients make it into one a nice little fresh salad garden if you will no laughing vikram this is a contest this is very serious it's not quite a salsa it's more like a tomato salad okay good because i was like this does not look like a salsa if you don't look at the close details of this bowl i didn't do a bad job there was like if you ignore absolutely everything that's in this bowl you would notice that it's good it sounds like you're having a full-blown workout over there right now oh i am i definitely lost like three pounds five slices of bacon on your board cut that in half and then cut those halves into little lardons that are about half inch are you are you slicing kind of yeah let me hear you say whale oh my god it's so depressing way over there's like oreo because i have no idea what half inches your feet are moving so fast normally when i cook i'm at home and i'm like all right i'm just gonna like relax and do this and then now it's like gaga gaga like a baby that's how i feel i feel incompetent cool bacon's on the stove right here we're just gonna cook that until it's crisp we're gonna get chives as thin as you can go so cut that bunch so i'm going down i'm slicing it then now done here's my choice what do you guys think i know they're not your chives but they're even how's your bacon looking oh looking good getting brown oh the spoon fell in the yeah i wiped this looking native face looking absolutely lovely i probably need 45 seconds alexa set a timer for 45 seconds how's the bacon look i'll uh i'll roll with it kendrick's yawning right now do you not cook your eggs i do well we're not doing that yet oh here's a cast-iron pan ah it's heavy you sounded like shakira that's all i want to be then pour that onto a cutting board and just give that a nice sort of rough chop i'm just about there back into your bowl boom there's a chive in there but that's okay lightly flour our work surface ah flour your dough pull them all out of there oh man this is what we have to work with should be nice and loose and stretchy is it yeah it's it's it's stretchy so first divide it in half cut into balls that are about an inch use your dough cut uh still cutting but cool so take all those pieces and then roll them into balls do you have balls yet i have lumps take a ball flower a part of your work surface place the ball on that work surface flower the ball love the ball pat the ball and then you're just gonna start rolling that guy out i think i sweat this much in a long time see we're just chilling right now it's okay all right i'm trying to like comfort him at this point i'm like worried for vikram yeah i'm worried for myself and now it is going in my uh my pan it would help if i turn this on boom finish tortilla look at that this is what i expected so how would you probably your grandma would be fraud hell yeah he's lying are you whimpering hear what you want this pan is not even on the burner i think it's just your vigorous movement is shaking it off that is actually the answer bam that's as good as it can get this was a success right here oh it's okay there wasn't much this reminds me of like my first day working for a restaurant it's horrible you're gonna have the right mindset you know we're just hanging out you know kendrick's back hurts that's we'll work on that i'm going to massage them later my workstation is clean and i have an avocado in front of me about to cut it right now cut your avocado in half then twist and it should boom just like that should have an exposed little uh seed right there looking lovely how do you get this out right josh take your knife and just gently tap with the blade stick twist and boom there you go comes right out take the seat out i've been trying to find ways to like use the avocado seed just stop or run your spoon around that avo and it should come right out just slice that keep them even something like that now hit it with some flaky salt like that little piece of lime and that is your avo got our components almost done now it's eggy waggy time so i've got my butt crack all of your eggs into that bowl got a little bit of shell in there no biggie are you calm i'm calm whisk it all together no shells so eggs in this bowl is so small and then just immediately start stirring those eggs constantly stirring stir stir stir stir stir it in we're not quite doing a soft scramble we're not quite doing what i would call an american scramble to be something sort of in between yeah i don't even need to look at you you sound confused now i think this is the best part okay it's going well i don't know when to stop but it looks like it should i feel like you're doing pretty good can we get a rating on how you think you're doing so far out of ten i feel like a four the dough is what is what's got me my eggs are done i'm gonna hit them with salt to taste and just a touch pepper that's done yet did a bit too much salt but it's okay oh no i didn't i just have salt on my fingers and i just like licks my fingers so one last component we're just going to add a nice little sort of three quarter tablespoon of creme fraiche and the finished egg lovely cooked through a little jiggly look at that see that jiggling galore let's get a tortilla close-up real quick here's my tortilla they always look a little different when they sit for a bit it's not great but i'm proud of it well that's all you need just some pride pride and pinion not sponsored one day make sure the tortilla is hot okay my hand's in there yeah mine is too i feel everything but my tortilla heating up all right there's so much to edit this is fun tortillas down and then you're going to add your egg first in a nice little line i want it to look real nice and pretty are you gonna make it look pretty for the people where to go and you better make it look so pretty i will try now the egg is done nice little line of bacon on your lovely breakfast taco we forgot about the potatoes ah that's okay it doesn't really matter we're gonna fry them and add them to this vikram's struggling enough as it is so we'll just leave it little sprinkle of chive we're going to add our tomate and then that's just going to kind of go in a diagonal there's my spoon oh it's in the egg well avocado is going on i don't know what this is supposed to look like microplane just a little bit of cheese right on top and then you're going to add your cilantro did you want to include a piece of lime thank you so much vikram is your taco done yes now we're gonna clear this all off and then i was lost my entire taco like okay continue sorry we're gonna clear all this off and then we're gonna present our final taco so vikram cover your taco up now i've only seen a little bit i already looked like a tragedy just i was nervous okay it happens you know my side's not super clean either just not like that it's not like this why are you already laughing we haven't been so bad hey yeah i had smaller tortillas i just didn't use it i thought we were going to go bigger that's a funny taco i won't be hungry later that doesn't look bad at all actually judging by your work station i was expecting it to be somewhat similar it's not it's not if i went to a taco shop and i got that i wouldn't be mad vic you know the uh the drill this doesn't feel food safe to eat but i'm gonna do it anyway it really holds its shape though i thought you said they were even yeah well the other ones are i guess not that yours is more saturated than mine how is yours so desaturated i don't know i don't have an answer for that it doesn't look too bad actually can already tell you the eggs are overcooked that's okay you ready vic you look scared okay it takes a second to chew the tortilla okay not a bad taco first stop not bad the tortilla bad yeah respectfully i i mean i was i knew that from the get-go but it would be bad but you know what's funny though it's not like any worse than like a mission tortilla that's not that bad like i don't like them personally flavor-wise all the flavors that i want are there spice levels right i can taste the cilantro i can taste the entire salsa the avocado is nice you don't like tomato and yet those are the best cut item in here everything else looks like you literally just took the knife and you're like i felt the worst about the tomatoes it's even no it's actually really good it's evenly cut the onion on the other hand is the most unevenly cut i mean i've ever seen in my entire career but all in all the flavors that i want are there so by no means is this a bad taco the only real adjustment that i would make salt you were worried about there being too much salt i feel like you pulled back i didn't pull back slightly you got nervous yeah you got to trust yourself vikram please your turn you're going to taste your own as well after this yeah i know i'm going to be disappointed in eating mine because that was very good mine's so messed up i don't know where you ate it you gotta finished it my tortilla is awful your eggs are better i'm fine on the salsa i would not eat my my taco if i paid two dollars for mine i would eat it really honestly this is not me trying to be nice to vikram all right i'm usually not so it's really just small changes that would make yours just as good as this you just needed more water in your tortilla and it would have been like this one and then adding more salt like literally that's it very basic components added together that would have required no skill whatsoever it's just a little bit of an adjustment and you would have had just as good of a taco so i would say big dub on both ends there's nothing wrong well there's a lot wrong with that taco but those [Music] ulysses liked my taco even though the tortilla was bigger i enjoyed it damn delicious should be here that was really good i'm gonna kiss him after this so the fact that it's just two small pieces that you could have done to fix i think you did pretty damn good and vikram gets to watch this all over again i have to edit this now before we go another massive thank you for 5 million subscribers this is a huge deal to us so thank you from the bottom of our hearts gonna do even better

A Philly cheesesteak should be greasy, cheesy, and of course,...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, this is one of the most debated sandwiches in american cuisine of all time so of course we gotta rock the boat [Music] we can't just step our foot in this dangerous territory without first assessing the landscape so we're gonna go all the way up to philadelphia just to eat cheesesteaks to make a point here and since traveling and food go hand in hand that's where today's sponsor geico comes in combining your home and car insurance could save you even more so head down to the link in the description to see how much you could save you know if anyone has any recommendations on this just let me know love some help this halo all right so we're in philadelphia right now here to eat philly cheesesteak we can't do a philadelphia cheesesteak recipe and not go to philadelphia okay pay respect let's begin first one of the day tony luke's i wanted it to be john's roast pork but uh they're closed on monday did not know that was gonna happen this happened last time when we went to uh nashville and all the ones i wanted to go to were closed my first unveiling so i'm kind of excited oh my god i have a couple first thoughts on this the bread is dope god philadelphia is very loud so it's good but it really needs salt like it's missing a lot of salt i feel like this isn't the best representation if i'm being honest everybody has a different opinion i don't think this is gonna be the best one let's move on to the next okay so we made it to de la sandro's it's closed actually it said it was open on google i don't know i guess they decided josh is coming we really don't want to do that fair enough so we're going next to max's which was recommended by oovoo jabber the two ones that i really wanted to go to are not open but thanks so much upward and onwards so as for recommendation maxes got to see everything up close and personal so i have a good idea of how they assembled it really beef heavy i got same thing as last time clearly different in my opinion juicier they ladled juices onto this one yeah this is it see this is what we were missing at the last one salt is there the pepper's there it seasoned just about right i would want a little more salt if it was me but i'm not happy with this bite at all they hit it with mayo that's the secret that's an optional thing in my opinion mandatory second stop and so far the best spot we have one last one steve's steve's prince of stakes our final destination uh they said hello here for everyone working in the back if you're watching hey big pop of kiss to you visually looks solid first off cheese pulled already i just opened it the steak is very uniformly cut which i do like they lay it out but they actually put the onions on top and then the cheese and all that and then layer it in here and melt it a little more almost culinary inclined this was my third most recommended number one being d'alessandro's number two john's rose pork max's was the best out of the three and this is probably on the bottom tier no salt at all but you know what if they season this maximally with salt it would be perfect would change this sandwich completely patty no buns groovy every single person in philadelphia that's from philadelphia or currently resides here told me specifically never ever to go to gino's or pats like the one that everyone talks about that doesn't live in philadelphia so the locals they don't like it we were gonna go there time doesn't allow it i just wanted to mention that it's been several hours we leave tomorrow morning i've got the context that i need so without further ado let's make this shall we okay so if we're gonna make a cheesesteak the first thing we must discuss is bread of course not just any bread it must come on a long hoagy roll sometimes with sesame seeds sometimes without them in this case we love sesame seeds so the first thing you're gonna do is not go to the grocery store because we're grown-ups and instead we're going to make our own from scratch to fully flex on all cheese sticks but also to maximize our control in the final product to do that we're going to begin with our dough if you think we're using cups in this you would be wrong because we want accurate numbers here so get yourself a large bowl and add 950 grams of bread flour 20 grams of fine sea salt and 12 grams of granulated sugar in a separate container get yourself 589 grams of water and bring it to a temperature around 98 degrees fahrenheit with skin three grams of instant yeast and that's your little yeasty gentleman to your flour mixture vigorously whisk in 50 grams of extra virgin olive oil then add all of your cloudy yeast juice i keep trying to come up with grotesque ways to say yeast to mixture so uh can get a rating on that okay all right not not bad right anyway begin mixing that by hand i want that mind body and dough connection mix that just until you get a shaggy dough and yes it will be sticky so stay calm clean off the excess dough from your hands cover with plastic wrap and let that rest at room temp for 15 minutes then pull the dough out it should be a little easier to handle give it a quick knead by picking it up and slapping it down over itself repeating that over and over for about one minute it's also called slap and fold or until it begins to turn smooth cover that again with plastic wrap and let it rest for another 15 minutes at room temp then give it one more slap and fold for another minute or so till very smooth then roll that into a lightly sweet ball lightly grease a work surface place your dough on there and cover with an inverted bowl and let that rest for 45 minutes to one hour just go find something to do play chess or something once it's done it should be a nice rotund dough split that guy into four even pieces weighing about 400 grams each and i'm tired of telling y'all this please weigh your dough pieces out what are you gonna do if you have one regular sized togi and then some awkward little four inch hoagie anyway shape those by gathering up all the sides and bring them to the center roll it over so the seam side is facing down then gently roll it in circles keeping constant contact with your work surface until you get a smooth ball place that ball in an individual container that has been generously greased with cooking oil you can either use smaller bowls or containers like these guys or a dough proofing box most containers will work here now cover those with a lid or with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for one to four days yep this dough can be made several days in advance two days is probably the ideal time though to make the dough first pull your dough out and let them come up to room temp for three hours once there's a room temp get yourself a large tea towel or a couch dust it lightly with rice flour or all-purpose flour to prevent sticking rice flour does do a better job with the non-sticky part then to shape your dough flour the top pop it out of its container so the unflowered side is facing up gently press the dough to flatten into a small rectangle then fold it in half away from you brush off any excess flour and fold it in half the same direction one more time pinch the seams closed roll it over so the seam side is facing down create some tension rolling it out to taper the ends as you get close to them until it's 12 inches long then very lightly brush the top with some water and roll it in untoasted sesame seeds to coat the entire dough except for the bottom now place your torpedo of flavor onto your koosh gently furl up the koosh to cradle the dough like this and repeat with the rest of your dough and next thing you know you've got a bunch of little gentlemen snuggling next to each other oh so cute now for a short nap before launching into a hellfire of a hot oven cover that with excess koosh tent with plastic wrap and let it proof for two hours yes it's a long process all right one hour before they're ready add a baking steel to your oven and heat to 500 degrees fahrenheit or as hot as your oven will allow then once your dough is done proofing and your oven is preheated lightly dust a pizza peel with rice flour or semolina carefully roll your dough onto the peel don't just pick it up like some barbarian all right you're gonna degas all that hard work make sure the sesame side is facing up then dip a razor blade or more specifically a lame in some water and score the entire length of dough beautifully then launch it into your preheated oven spray the dough in parts of the oven avoiding the glass door on the oven that's a hazard to say the least close the door promptly then after two and a half minutes spray the dough again wait another two and a half minutes and spray the dough for a final and third time then just let it bake for eight to twelve minutes or until a beautiful golden brown remove your hoagie from the oven and cool in a wire rack and repeat with the remaining three pieces of dough okay so the hardest part is out of the way because really making a philly cheese stick is easy as long as you follow some of the rules so first thing you're gonna need is a green bell pepper take that and throw that right out the window because it seems that most of philadelphians don't find that traditional so uh nice let's talk about my meat or well our meat or uh the meats here we have a four pound boneless rib roast that was in the freezer for 30 minutes just to firm it up a little bit and look this needs to be sliced real thin you can absolutely do it with a sharp knife but if you want to speed things up then i'd recommend using a deli meat slicer which is like okay i understand papa being papa and should you desire not to spend money on something that's kind of ridiculous like that then obviously just use your knife now go ahead and slice that bad boy as thinly as you can while maintaining the structural integrity of the meat should look something like this then you'll sort of reach a point where slicing any thinner becomes impossible and or dangerous which in that case just go ahead and save the rest of that steak for a date night or something anyway for some extra fatty flavors snag two pounds of boneless short ribs or three pounds of bone-in short ribs and of course remove their bones and slice those against the grain about an eighth of an inch thick don't leave this out because the marbling of this will go a long way in the final product alright next up is some say slices others say dice well the way i'd like to do it is get yourself three sweet onions cut the top off then the bottom cut it in half peel it and slice that into big chunky one-inch pieces like this now we're ready to cook okay so you're gonna get yourself a little pan right a little little baby pan little stinky pan no well maybe listen you need this to be cooked on a griddle or plancha of some sort that's how it's normally done trust papa when he says plancha cooking hits different a large cast iron griddle pan that goes on your stovetop will work fine but papa has other plans i literally bought this uh only for this video so heat up half your griddle to medium high and the other half to low fill a squirt bottle with half a cup of vegetable oil and half a cup of melted warm tala which is just rendered beef fat which by the way you can acquire from any b-fat trim for example like the b-fat trim from the rib roast you have all you have to do is rough chop it place it in a pan heat it over low stirring often until all the fat is rendered out then just strain that through a fine mesh trainer and well that's your tallow it's optional but it adds a ton of flavor now once your griddle is hot hot good lord jandis squirt it with your b-fat oil and let that get nice and hot then add a third of your sweet onion season that the taste of salt and a small pinch of sugar saute that stirring and flipping often for about five minutes or until your onions are soft and begun to get some charring and nice caramelization slide those onions to the cooler side of the griddle squirt the hot side with some more oil with some more beef fat and let that heat just until it begins to smoke then add a third of your sliced beef let that sear nicely for about a minute then season the taste with salt let that continue to sear for another 30 seconds to a minute one of my biggest gripes was the lack of color on the beef in the philly cheesesteaks that i had so when you flip your beef you should see a decent amount of color just be forewarned if you let it go too long it'll go dry now flip and sear the other side season again to taste with salt and a generous fresh crack of black pepper then once it's seared and cooked through but still juicy but one to two more minutes give that a nice rough chop with a spatula mixed together with your onions and at this point you're ready to add your cheese be aware that this is only a third of your batch so you can obviously be doing this in three batches so you can get proper color now bring everything together in a rough line about the shape of a full hoagie this is enough meat for one to two sandwiches depending on how you like it layer on three to four slices of provolone cheese which is ideally sharp provolone then just let that melt you can also speed up the melting process with the use of papa's magic wand which is also known as a blowtorch now while it's melting get your hoagie cut in half but leave the back end attached so it's got something to stop the meat from falling out the other end optionally spread on a nice layer of mayo if you roll like that this is just a basic garlic mayo consisting of 1 cup of mayonnaise and 4 cloves of grated garlic season a taste of salt and whisked together beautifully simple yet incredible and once that cheese is melted get a large spatula and scoop up your meat and good lord that cheese pull is going to make me act up now add as much cheese steak as you like into your bread close it up observe its jaw-dropping cheesy features and take a moment to see if we hit the nail on the head or not here well would you look at that now this this is what i was looking for this hoagie is toit i mean it's got the oh my god it's kinda squeaky it's juicing oh good lord have mercy on my soul i'm about to push good lord there's almost too much flavor in this compared to the ones that we have right off the bat to me this tastes like what i imagined a philly cheese stick to taste it's anxious rich the beef flavor is just like yeah and that extra beef fat really does help this hoagie is soft spongy chewy on the outside in that garlic mayo i mean really this is a perfect food i think i could only eat one of these though and i'd be done this could use mustard the philadelphians are like what hey kid you can't just be go put a mustard on a philly cheesesteak what's wrong with you i think what we made today was an excellent philly cheesesteak i don't know what the philadelphians think let us know in the comments but you know visually looking at this tasting it this is what i felt a philly cheesesteak should have been from the get-go but this is not a but better and secondarily we have one more special gold cheesesteak that is uh not exactly traditional but um we're gonna do it anyway okay so that was definitely a big dub but what if we took it a step further and made a philly cheesesteak but you know with a5 miyazaki wagyu real simple this time we're just going to julienne a sweet onion get that sauteing with your b-fat season to taste with salt then once they get some decent color scoot it to the side next get a half pound of oyster mushrooms rough chop them heat a pan with two tablespoons of butter or your b fat over medium-high then once it's ripping hot add your mushrooms season a taste with salt and pepper and let those sear stirring often for about three minutes or until softened with some light browning place it to the side now optionally one more thing you know we might as well make this extra fancy by making a fried garlic sage topping first heat up half cup of oil in a small pan over medium high and while it's heating add your garlic first and let that come up naturally with the heat and fry just until golden brown then remove it and once the oil is hot add your sage and fry just until it begins to stop bubbling and crisp drain on a paper towel then combine those two and crush together and that's your topping all right we're almost there snag yourself a 20 to 25 ounce a5 miyazaki wacky rib eye portion that bad boy into sliceable segments i like to separate out the eye and cut it into two manageable pieces there's more to this obviously but you can save that for another time place that directly on an ungreased hot side of the griddle and let that sear season your meat generously with salt and let that sear for two to three minutes flip and enjoy a tantalizing sizzle of beefy beauty and sear the other side for another two to three minutes remove from the griddle and let that rest for five minutes then while that's resting let's make our spicy mayo get a medium sized bowl and add half a cup of mayo a quarter cup of cholula three tablespoons of sriracha two teaspoons of garlic powder and salt and pepper to taste give that a nice little whisk until thoroughly combined then all you gotta do is toast your bread quickly in that beautiful beef fat stack on a nice big slice of swiss cheese a couple slices of smoked gouda melt those guys down with a blow torch or a broiler then add a generous layer of your spicy mayo followed by your onions then mushrooms slice your beef beautifully about a third of an inch thick then place it atop your sandwich top with your optional fried sage and garlic close the hatch tuck a napkin in your shirt put on your italian leather gucci shoes and enjoy the most luxurious cheesesteak to grace any kitchen and who knows maybe it's even better let's find out you know after spending literally four or five hundred dollars on the ascent tires just one sandwich i don't want to eat it does that sound bratty a little bit but it's a circumstantial thing it does look good oh wow this is actually a lot better than the original philly cheesesteak thank god thank god i was really weird i thought it was gonna be too rich it's actually not the bread is just spongy enough that it absorbs all that fat i mean you can see it absorbing the fat and it's not overly so it's not like it's gushing b fat directly in my mouth maybe a little bit maybe a little bit of squirt squirt that's all right we talked about how juicy juicy squid squirts the way to go the fattiness the juiciness the richness i even went in for a second bite and i meant that bite all things that we've tested we've done the original we've done this fancy version in my opinion this is a more exciting bite they're equally sort of like rich but to me this is more exciting this is juicier this has a lot more flavors going on but it's not a cheesesteak really it's not it does have steak and cheese but it's not if i were to pick one i probably would probably pick this one right here we made two sandwiches the regular philly cheesesteak this unnecessarily expensive one if you have the means to make an expensive one i would highly recommend it but either way they're both beautifully mined numbingly delicious just make a dang cheesesteak and do me a favor do it the right way you want to know what else spends 500 just to make an incredibly unnecessarily fancy cheesesteak b-roll [Music] all right guys that is it we are back home thank you again to our friends at geico for sponsoring today's video they're helping me with my culinary journey around the united states and they want to help you too of course by helping you save money on your home and car insurance so head over to the link down below and visit geico.com today now let's talk about this philly cheesesteak we made two different versions the second one's more of like an ethereal dream that was like formulated in my brain and spat out on a plate and actually ended up pretty good it's a little sacrilegious in what a cheesesteak should be but i do what i want do i think that we paid respect and homage to the tradition of what a philly cheesesteak should be yes i do was i disappointed with many of the places we went to i'll leave that up to you to decide but with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned

breakfast sandwich and it's 11 what when you can make it even fancier for this price right here that is but cheaper so [Music] very important things to say this new york times best seller number one thanks to you thanks to everyone who supported thank you if you have your book and you haven't left a review leave a review and if you haven't gotten the book what the it's a goddamn new york times best seller you're gonna tell me you're not gonna go get that go get it link's in the description the second thing is we just hit five million subscribers we're gonna do something on that very soon and the third thing or fifth or there's multiple things so i know that everyone's wanting a book tour we won a little mini one it was amazing tons of people showed up that we took over the san francisco ferry building and the barnes and noble in the grove in los angeles so thank you for coming we're doing more it's a bit of a struggle planning it but they're coming keep an eye out keep your uh peeled anyway let's make this sandwich okay so a breakfast sandwich usually consists of all the things that make breakfast in a sandwich which could be multiple things scrambled eggs bacon egg and cheese whatever blah blah blah pretty much if it has eggs in it people just assume all right that's a breakfast sandwich so is a burger with an egg on it at a breakfast sandwich it basically is right i think this is one of those menu items that's egregiously expensive for what it should actually be we're talking about buns egg cheese maybe bacon no just no and more specifically under seasoned eggs the only thing that's good about it is the cheese you're biting into it and if there's a bite with no cheese you're just like god where's the dang cheese that's not a good song so i don't have much else to say about this other than we're gonna make the fanciest one we can for the cheapest price physically possible so with all that said let's make this shall we ah look at these shabbat buns artisanal lovely you think that's store-bought yeah well this is but cheaper buddy and local bakery shabbat don't come cheap but we can certainly make it ourselves yeah i bet you were probably already expecting that now first we're going to start with our poolish consider this the flavor and the rise to our bread first in a bowl get yourself 220 grams of bread flour separately you're gonna hydrate a scant quarter teaspoon of instant yeast into 220 grams of water that's around 95 degrees fahrenheit i say quarter teaspoon because it's less than one gram so now cover that with plastic wrap and let that sit at room temp overnight for 14 to 18 hours once that's done it should look like this now we're ready to make our dough in the bowl of a stand mixer add 375 grams of bread flour and 12 grams of fine sea salt mix it together now place it on your stand mixer with the dough hook add your poolish to your flour dissolve a half teaspoon of instant yeast into 257 grams of water that's around 95 degrees fahrenheit add that to your stand mixer and let that mix for five to six minutes or until your dough starts to pull from the sides of the bowl now mind you this will be extremely loose and sticky that's how ciabatta dough is just trust in the process all right now coat a large bowl with non-stick spray add your dough cover the plastic wrap and let that rise for one hour during that hour pop a baking steel or pizza stone into the middle rack of your oven as well as a cast iron skillet on the bottom of the oven preheat that brother up to 450 degrees fahrenheit and yes we want to preheat it for this long i want it hot hot top of the morning top of the morning top of the morning after that hour i want you to stretch and fold your dough by picking up a piece of it with damp hands stretching it to its max without tearing folding it over itself and repeating that all the way around the perimeter of the dough like this then cover that and let it rest for 25 minutes then stretch and fold again rest 25 minutes covered stretch and fold one last time and then cover and rise for 45 more minutes that's the process at this point it should be nice and homogeneous and a beautiful smooth dough now comes shaping time be gentle but move quick you ever heard that one before maybe in a little special place be gentle but move quick sweetheart now generously flour a work surface and carefully dump your dough onto it gently form into a rough rectangle without degassing split it right down the middle lengthwise with a bench scraper generously flour a board or pizza peel with flour and cornmeal then cut each of those segments into three even segments you know flowering as needed and utilizing basic math you should end up with six evenly sized pieces gently cover with an inverted container like this let it rest at room temp for 30 minutes now all you gotta do is pop three to four of these guys at a time onto a piece of parchment paper giving at least two inches of space between them quickly load them onto your seal or stone add one cup of ice cubes to your scorching hot cast iron pan and immediately spray the back of your oven and a little of your loaves with water not the glass though cause glass and heat and water probably not a good idea so try to avoid the glass please quickly close the door and bake for 15 minutes then remove your steamer and bake for five to eight more minutes or until a beautiful golden brown ciabatta emerges i just want to shove the whole thing in my mouth even though that would be physically impossible without unhinging my jaw like some sort of horrifying anaconda human-like creature but hey they look good right anyway let those cool the room temp and repeat the process with the remaining shabara now another thing you can make while that's all rising is this spicy uh mayo mayoli spaioli sounds weird in a small bowl add half a cup or 120 grams of mayonnaise two tablespoons or 30 grams of sriracha three cloves of grated garlic salted taste and the juice of half a lemon stir that together and you have your special breakfast sandal sauce next let's talk tomatoes i want those tomatoes to be special so yummy so get yourself two large beautiful tomatoes and slice that into half inch slices keep the got dang slices even please all this prep can be done while you're waiting for your bread so you have the time and don't even try to talk your way out of it buddy heat a large pan with just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom over medium-high and once that's ripping hot add your tomatoes in one layer season your taste with salt and sear for one to two minutes or so you flip and looks beautifully brown and lightly charred like this repeat on the other side oh also season again with salt and let's see here for another minute the goal here is color but don't let the tomato go to complete mush part of that is making sure your tomatoes are not over ripe otherwise you'll get tomato puree instantaneously and that sucks place the tomatoes to the side and repeat with the rest next is our cured meat normally people pick overpriced canadian bacon or regular bacon but instead we're using something a little more exciting like mortadella because it's typically cheaper and also significantly cooler again heat up that skillet with just enough oil to coat the bottom over medium high add your mortadella sear it for one minute per side just to get it hot and a little bit of color flip sear for another 20 seconds move to the side and repeat with the rest of your mortar deli skeleton last but not least is a beautiful fried egg it's simple same exact concept oil in the pan heat over medium high this time you want a little bit more oil sort of like a small pool now once it's hot crack in your eggs and let them cook just until the whites are set then either swirl the pan or flick some of the oil on top of the egg just to finish cooking the white place it aside and that's your fried egg it's not rocket science and to be honest you should know how to fry an egg by now that goes for everybody all right it's an accountability check now we're ready to assemble first get a shabata bun toast that absolute unit to utter perfection and you know always toast now layer down add a generous layer of spayo on the bottom of that bun and on the top bun add one layer of cheddar cheese and one layer of gouda cheese now either broil that or hit that heavy with a blowtorch until melted and a little bit of char add a nice fat slice of your brulee tomato a generous layer of your seared mortadella one to two fried eggs depending on your preference to be honest this sandwich is pretty heavy so one i think would normally do just fine but it felt like being extra here because b-roll obviously now before topping this add yourself some fresh basil leaves on top just scatter them around don't overthink it snag that top bun and respectfully crown your king i mean wow look at this the egg is busting it's got the drip and just by looking at that i think i'm about to bus and all for this price per sandwich right gat dang here now let's see if that taste can surpass its unbelievably low cost wow look at this aftermath now that looks like a saturday night first off the shabbata unbelievably soft i'll be right back this looks beautiful i'm ready to eat it let's go that's me giving myself the credit card because i made it this is i'm beyond words screw this being a breakfast sandwich this is a perfect sandwich on its own whether it's for breakfast or not doesn't even need to be for breakfast this would be i would have this for dinner breakfast for dinner brender i know there's a lot more effort that goes into this but really almost all the effort goes into the bun itself wanna know why i can tell you that because we waited until the very last second to actually make all the components to put it on the sandwich because the entire day was taken up by making the bread you're left with a multitude of buns of shabbat you can store them in the wherever you store shabata and then assemble the sandwiches as you want or you could just go buy shabbat but guess what it wouldn't be much cheaper if you did that jabata's expensive but not when you make it water and flour that's cheap with all that being said this is a perfect sandwich cheap or not i would pay 20 for this sandwich and yet it's for this price right here what else do you want this is but cheaper we did the darn thing whoa be careful with knives make the god dang sandwich you want to know what else has juices oozing and running all over itself b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our beautiful breakfast sandwich a stunning shabbat bread made pretty simply it takes a little time all right i'll give you that you can make any of our other bread doughs and it's going to be similar in price so shut up if you don't want to make the shibata all right sick of it i don't want to wait for it to sit in the fridge are you serious get over yourself you're going to watch netflix for four hours tonight just take literally five minutes to mix three ingredients together and leave it on the counter covered in plastic wrap are you serious and you know what that's it enjoy your day if you enjoyed this video if you liked it or whatever leave a like subscribe okay shut up [Music] you

Not only are we going to do that, but we are using homemade dough to bring it all home. Masala sticky caramel for...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, there are many recipes throughout time that have remained unchecked especially bread recipes and today we're going to chin check this one [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today we are making pull apart bread monkey bread whatever you want to call it balls in a pan and you bake it for the longest time people have been doing with this pre-canned biscuit dough or pre-can this just make the dough it takes very little time you're just going to wait for it to rise we're going to make it with a brioche style dough more specifically we're going to do it two different ways a sweet way in a savory way you got your dessert and you got your i guess you put it on the dinner table right instead of dinner rolls you put you put this on there see look at that you like that that's pretty cool now with all that said let's make this shall we well well well here we are we made it to the ooey gooey breadland this is the kind of stuff that you eat until you feel physical pain which i don't recommend for the record now we have two for you here a sweet garam masala rum caramel sticky bun monkey bread and a savory sesame parmigiano garlic monkey bread don't that sound good i know your body is tingling right now thankfully these both use the exact same dough so we're gonna start there it's easy so again remain calm and stress free now acquire one and a half cups or 375 milliliters of whole milk that's around 95 degrees fahrenheit give the glass a few taps for good vibes then to that you're gonna mix in two and a quarter teaspoon or seven grams of instant yeast and place that to the side now in the bowl of stand mixer add four and a quarter cup or six hundred and forty grams of all-purpose flour then to that you're gonna add a quarter cup or 52 grams of granulated sugar i actually wrote garn-laded sugar so that too and one and a quarter cup or five grams of fine sea salt mix together until thoroughly combined and pop that brother onto your stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment then begin mixing that on medium speed and slowly pour in six tablespoons or 82 grams of unsalted butter that's been gently melted okay gently not hot once it's incorporated pour in your big yeasty milkies followed by two large eggs then just let that mix for about three to four minutes or until you get a nice homogeneous dough yes it's going to be quite sticky now dump that out onto a floured work surface give it a few slap and folds then using flour to de-stick as necessary gently form into a ball plop that into a grease bowl and let it rest covered for 10 minutes then pull it out slap and fold for two more minutes then back into your bowl plastic wrap it and let it rise for one to two hours at room temp now while that's going let's make a rum caramel in a medium saucepan combine one cup or 200 grams of granulated sugar and a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of water make sure the sugar is totally saturated with the water then heat that over medium low till the sugar is dissolved then take one cinnamon stick char it lightly with a kitchen torch or on your stovetop then place that into your sugar syrup and let it continue to simmer for about five to eight minutes or until it turns a beautiful amber color please do me a favor while this is simmering don't stir it immediately whisk in a third cup or 75 grams of cubed cold unsalted butter then once that's emulsified whisk in half a cup of heavy whipping cream then remove that from the heat and finally whisk in three and a half tablespoons or 50 milliliters of your favorite rum now pull your cinnamon stick out and place it in the container you plan to store this in and you guessed it pour your rum caramel in and let that bad boy cool all the way down now just before your dough is and done let's make our masala sugar it sounds fancy it's quite easy combine one cup or 200 grams of granulated sugar with one tablespoon or 14 grams of garam masala spice and a quarter teaspoon of fresh grated nutmeg whisk that together and that's your now take your fully matured and risen dough with all of its aspirations and dreams then quickly punch out every last quark of life out of it then dump it onto a lightly floured work surface and divide that bad boy into 45 small pieces at this point i really recommend weighing these dough pieces out which you're going to want all of them to be about 28 to 30 grams each then once you have all of your pieces roll those bad boys into taut and supple bowls each and every one of them all those balls oh yeah nice balls now lightly grease a bundt cake pan roll the bowl in your masala sugar and place it in your cake pan then repeat with all of your dough dough piece balls sugar cake pan rinse and repeat until you've used all of your dough and your bundt pan is full like this now cover that with plastic wrap and let that proof at room temp for 20 minutes and just before that's done in a small saucepan combine half a cup or 112 grams of unsalted butter with one cup or 215 grams of packed light brown sugar heat it over low heat until everything is melted increase the heat to medium low and bring them to a light simmer then after simmering for about a minute and it looks homogenous pour your glaze while it's hot over your masala monkey bread and pop it into your oven that's been preheated to 350 fahrenheit to 35 to 45 minutes or until golden brown and lovely take it out of the oven let it cool for five minutes and then invert it on a large serving platter or cake stand and immediately remove that top and drench that guy with as little or as much rum caramel as you like once it's coated serve immediately while warm trust me this gotta be served while warm it's so much better now at this point just take a gander at how fluffy light and rich that dough is looking one catch of the eye on that and good lord have mercy on my soul for i'm about to push it down wow look at this we let it rise a little too long so it looks more bunt cake like but i can assure you there's big bowls in here i will demonstrate how big the balls are oh my god look at this just soaked oh oh my god it's so good i just swallowed that whole ball barely barely chewed it that could be used in so many meme formats this is so good i just swallowed a whole ball most of these sort of like pull apart breads monkey breads whatever the hell you want to call them they're always slightly under baked in a way that's not good right they're gummy this is like fluffy but it has that density it kind of has that custard-like quality it's soft and pillowy like biting into a cloud but the cloud is covered in rum caramel and glaze and masala spice that's it i she doing that all for me yeah you guys can try this that's perfect there's nothing more pillowy than this this is so good it's like if god personally made a cinnamon roll this is a bun better this is donut holes better cinnamon rolls better cake better this is the ultimate dessert this is something good instead of chewing it i just want to grab it just you heard it from the squad from myself this is the greatest monkey bread of your entire life but we're not gonna stop here i got one more thing right up my pantaloons why did i say that okay next up is mr savory so same thing make the dough rise it punch it down divide it into 45 pieces make bowls and we're back to the spot i want you in this time we have two coating agents here one will be plain untoasted sesame seeds and the other will be a mixture of two cups of finely grated parmesan reggiano a quarter cup finely chopped garlic half a cup of finely chopped parsley and one teaspoon of thyme leaves toss that together and that's coating number two now once you have all of your prepped balls we're gonna first dip our ball gently in melted unsalted butter again make sure your butter's not hot okay just melted then roll it in one of the coatings of choice until fully coated then toss into the prepared bundt pan then with the next ball dip in the butter and coat in the opposing coating see where i'm going here you're going to repeat alternating between each one we're not doing both on one ball to one or the other so keep on repeating alternating between each type of coating to get a varying texture then once you're done with that and all of your dough balls are coated and in the bundt pan take the remainder of that butter and parmesan garlic mixture combine the two and pour half of that on top of your dough you can save the rest for literally anything put it on a steak you're gonna love it now cover that with plastic wrap and proof for 20 minutes then remove the plastic wrap and bake at 350 degrees fahrenheit for 35 to 40 minutes or until a beautifully golden brown and yet again pop it out of the bundt pan onto a plate and observe a more beautiful garlic bread worthy of its finger food capabilities now let's give these two a taste test and see if there is a real winner in this bread doughy world look at this guy look at parmigiano garlic sesame monkey bread first off the caramelization the browning the my yard and then look at this glistening good lord janice goddamn oh my god the verdict i actually still like the sweet one over this but imagine you're hosting a party you just want one monkey bread for dessert why not have a savory one beforehand make a little sandwich with this dip it in a ranch you're welcome that'll be 400 billion dollars oh so we have two different monkey breads it's up to you which one you want to make this was made properly i'm sick and tired of seeing the biscuit version all right using the instant biscuit just make your own damn dough just make your own dough take your leave buddy bone apple tea you want to know what else has grubby little finger foods clawing for the next little roll b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our monkey bread pull apart bread ball bread balls and a thing with balls see where we're going with this if i'm being honest i prefer the sweet one probably because i have a little bit more of a sweet tooth i will say that the parmesan garlic was in general a crowd favorite a lot of people kept going back to it i really liked it so depending what you're doing pick what you want that's what it's all about so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or

you see this what is this for why do they take the time to do this so this is a dorito that's cool i'm with that what is this this is for the sticker she peeled the sticker off she went like this here you go where do i even begin there's just so many things that are wrong with this the funny thing is the dorito aspect barely shines through i feel like it's completely overwhelmed with that classic wet lettuce this is what y'all are all hype about johnny come change the diety the baby made a mess oh sorry just a doritos locos taco there's nothing special about this i don't know why they even created this menu item it's all about the hype and we're going to extinguish that wow here we are making a doritos locos taco not gonna lie kind of excited so let's not waste one single taco finger licking minute let's break this down into components we got the meat luscious and lovely we got the taco shells with a beautifully delicate yet earth-shattering crunch the lettuce which is usually a letdown and of course papa's thick cream oh and also the cheese can't forget the cheese oh uh also the tomatoes right forgot about those let's first talk about my cream alright alright our cream in a medium bowl add half a cup or 120 grams of mayonnaise a third cup or 82 grams of sour cream 2 teaspoons or 5 grams of aleppo pepper 3 cloves of garlic grated and salt to taste give it a nice little whisk [Applause] and that's your cream doesn't seem like much but this is actually one of my favorite chili cremas that we've made you know what actually let's make this a life lesson there are times in our day on this earth that less is actually more thank you optionally you can put this guy in a squirt bottle nice you like my little weird baggy technique let us know what you think in the comments and while you're down there buy my book literally just came out like yesterday and the link is in the description thank you so much okay papa geese next let's talk meat taco bell has been known to have the most pitiful ground meat i've ever experienced so we're gonna take it a step further by grinding our own you'll need one and a half pounds or 680 grams of boneless chuck roast cut into pieces that will fit into a meat grinder one and a half pounds or 680 grams of boomers pork shoulder and half a pound or 225 grams of any bacon that you like combine that all into a bowl and well run that through your meat grinder of choice like i've said before if you have a kitchenaid stand mixer there is no reason you should not have the got dang attachment for meat grinding link in the description if you want once that's ground knead it together like it's a voluptuous dough until it's nicely emulsified now add in two teaspoons or five grams of chili powder as in the seasoning a quarter teaspoon of ground cinnamon and a quarter teaspoon of ground cumin knead that in now in a large cast iron skillet heat up just enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan over medium heat once that's hot add in one diced onion hit that with some salt to taste and saute for about five minutes stirring often until softened remove that from the pan absolutely crank your heat up to medium high and once it's hot hot good lower jaundice add in your meat press firmly to make full pan contact and let that bad boy sear for about two minutes or until nicely browned give her a flip and repeat on the other side hit that lightly with salt add your onions back in and stir that together let that continue to cook until everything is mostly fully cooked then to get that ultra fine texture use a potato masher to press over and over until you reach fine crumbles and then once it's completely cooked turn off the heat add in three cloves of finely chopped garlic and add any additional salt and pepper if needed and that juicy needy man is all done now for the tamat it's real easy first cut off the top and the bottom of a tomato a nice big chunky one then gently remove the core with your knife squeeze out any excess seeds now from there you'll dice that bad boy into half inch cubes place them on a sheet tray and season lightly with salt toss and let that sit for 10 minutes and you should have some nice plump yet not overly watery tomatoes next component is lettuce now hold up don't think you're above talking about lettuce first off i'm offended second off there's a mind-blowing way to make this better maybe mind-blowing might be a bit of an overstatement but hear me out of course it starts with a half a head of very thinly sliced iceberg lettuce into a bowl but this is the kicker then you're gonna add in a small handful of cilantro finely chopped the zest of one lemon toss it all together and while it doesn't seem like much you now have the world's freshest and most fragrant sliced lettuce in the world okay it's the moment we've all been waiting for the doritos locos taco shell there are layers here so be patient the first layer is our birya flavored beef fat dip yeah now i know your toes just tingled when you heard that in a small bowl combine one seeded guajillo chili and one seeded ancho chili cover that with boiling water and let that sit until softened now in a medium sized cast iron skillet add one pound or 450 grams of finely chopped beef fat sit over medium low heat and add two cinnamon sticks half a teaspoon or three grams of ground cumin let that cook stirring often until most of the fat is rendered out and you have little brown crispy beef bits now turn off the heat and add five cloves of garlic that have been crushed but left whole three bay leaves one teaspoon or four grams of dried mexican oregano stir and let those flavors sit and extract for seven minutes in a blender add your rehydrated guajillo chilies minus the water then strain your beef fat through a mesh trainer and directly into your blender blend that on high speed until it's as smooth as you can get it then press it through another fine mesh sieve and that right there is a pure unadulterated flavor brother place that guy to the side and let's make our nacho cheese dust in a medium sized bowl add 2 teaspoons or 5 grams of chili powder 2 teaspoons or 5 grams of smoked paprika half a teaspoon or 2 grams of msg 2 teaspoons or 7 grams of fine sea salt half a cup or 80 grams of cheddar cheese powder which you can get on amazon 3 tablespoons or 30 grams of buttermilk powder then give that a nice little whisk until thoroughly combined and that is your seasoning okay we're ready to form our crispy tortillas heat a large heavy bottom pot filled halfway with vegetable oil and heated to 365 degrees fahrenheit now look you don't need a contraption to form taco shells you can totally just toss in a corn tortilla fry until it begins to turn a little stiff but it's still malleable then form it with tongs hold it down in a taco shape until it holds that shape and it's brown and crisp to your liking now i for one want these looking like a gap dang machine made it so instead i am gonna use some taco shell shaper so hypocrite he's such a hypocrite what the heck now i tested some tortillas to be totally raw and some that were dipped in the iberia flavored fat obviously the birya flavored fat was ten thousand times better so i would go that route take a corn tortilla dip it into your berry flavored fat flip dip the other side drain the excess and place on a plate then repeat with about 12 to 14 tortillas let them sit to soak up all that meaty delicious flavor and then you're ready to fry place the corn tortilla in that bad boy then drop them in and fry two at a time and once they're crisp and beginning to turn golden brown remove them from the oil pop them on a wire rack and immediately dust on all sides with your nacho cheese powder and once those are done being dusted place them upside down to finish cooling on a sheet tray and repeat with the rest of your taco shells this recipe will make about 12 total tacos so that means you'll need 12 shells so we're ready it's assembly time first your taco shell undeniably crisp and dusted like a freshly snow-capped mountaintop followed by your juicy meat really press it down so it fits nice and snug in there a generous layer of your aleppo garlic crema a nice little garden of your fragrant iceberg followed by as little or as much tomato as you desire and to top it all off a generous layer of fresh grated sharp cheddar cheese now this to me looks like what a doritos look goes taco wishes it could be and really by comparison i feel bad for the person that would have to eat that taco bell tortilla that's literally built like a real thin e-boy that's a joke e-boys please any e-boys watching papa keys okay now let's see what really lives up to the hype so this is what the photo looks like and then this is what you get weird how this actually looks like that good lord there's no competition here at all there have been a few here and there that were like oh this one's better but you know not that much but this is a completely different planet make this will change your life my life has been changed not really though because i would never go and order this the richness of the beef the beef is perfectly seasoned there's actual flavor in there the fat it's juicy it's rich and anxious the crema provides some level of a cut deliciousness some freshness but there's also a little bit of a right on the and of course the crunch of the lettuce it's not overwhelming this has the meaty component that it needs to combat the lettuce it's not like a salad in a crunchy taco shell i'm gonna need to make another one for mr kendrick yay but better it always feels weird when i can't see yeah i know anything could go in your mouth i mean uh anything could happen hopefully it's a finger tell me have you had a doritos locos taco before i have not had a doritos loco taco before you're about to have one of these that could be a greedy's logos taco this is the worst intro we've ever had but better i believe in my magic do you believe in magic i do believe in magic i don't know how to do this so hold this hand out turn it this way a little well no um if you put a taco in my hand i feel like i can figure why is your hot thumb over there mine is over here what are you talking what what are your thumbs in weird places i mean yours are jesus good work and then numero dos i already know this next one's gonna be very disappointing it's flopping i felt it flop first one's so much better it was so good starting off with what i hate about the stock this doritos taco bell locos taco it's super soggy i like that you put taco bell in the middle of it doritos taco bell locos i don't blame doritos for the for what's wrong yeah i agree this ground beef just kind of tastes like wet meat it's slopped up i even like your like fabricated nacho flavor dorito flavor more than i like this doritos so much better okay here's here's here's my last thing is that i would it's about the layering of components that come together to make one beautiful thing greater than the sum of its parts it combines to create an amalgamation of flavor that you should desire out of a doritos logos taco this is what it should have always been that's but better buddy okay so we're cleaning don't forget to get that dang book it's down in the description it's out now what are you doing what what are you waiting for made this whole mess just for you and i would love for you to have this book you know those those pre-orders that everyone got i really am appreciative of that i feel like in general in general like you know not everybody wants to get a book until it's out or anything for that matter and i feel like it's it just goes to show how it just goes to show how much love you guys have and i appreciate that i appreciate you get the damn book it's right here go get it god you want to know what else has undeniably thick shells and a juicy moist inside be wrong [Music] [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our doritos locos taco i don't even want to call it that anymore i'm just going to say josh's cheesy yummy taco or maybe something better than that this is not something that i would ever make in any other scenario so i'm not really going to come up with a good name for it we're just going to say that's what it is and it was actually delicious and so maybe i will make it again i'm contradicting myself once you make this you will suddenly realize how massively better it can be and i know that's the constant thing that we say about butt better but this one really was a shocker i wasn't sure if we were gonna really be able to match that classic flavor it definitely had some reminiscent flavors but it went so far beyond it i didn't even care bro didn't even care take that to heart think about it stop thinking about it go make it with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe

Nonetheless, we are here to take the title of king blooming onion.

Get My Cookbook: http://bit.ly/JWCookbookAmaz...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, yet another one that you're forcing me into do i think that we can do it god i hope so come on [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so we're about to show you a really funny skit that we made but i need to let you know that this upcoming week i will be on a book tour signing your books come and see me only at these locations currently on these dates so anyway without further ado [Music] it doesn't say what surface to cut this on okay this can't be right what am i supposed to be using a spoon oh god it doesn't say anywhere in here that i should be wearing clothes who wrote this this is obviously a joke but you know what's not a joke buying my cookbook and the link is in the description thank you so much number one across the globe thanks to you guys and if you haven't pre-ordered yet you really should because the pre-order faces okay so if you don't know what a blooming onion is congratulations just get off the video now because you can save yourself you don't have to go through this just kidding please stay i think the blooming onion is just a little gimmicky i'd rather have it in nice formed rings that are all nicely cooked when you make a blooming onion you end up with like parts that aren't fully cooked and some that are overcooked and it just looks like a facehucker that it's just like right you don't want i don't want that but nonetheless can we make it better of course will i ever make this again probably not but maybe you will so with all that said let's make this shall we okay time to order this is vikram's phone i hope there's no funny silly man picks on here and alpaca what do i do they say good day mate i'm throwing your phone out the window can i just do three blooming onions already 25.95 is your total okay awesome thank you 25 this is gonna be a butt cheaper too oh my god we're here good eye mike stop ugh am i supposed to go to curbside did we order curbside i said pickup i don't know what to do why do they even have this system here when all these cars parked are literally in the restaurant i get that we have everything going on but like pick one call me the cdc haircuts that's not right good god so i guess i pull up here there they are yeah for sure she's like going up to the manager and they're like what do we do what do we do uh refresh them all she's very nice good vibe thank you so much we're gonna we're gonna eat them right over there i promise now i feel bad i've never seen the faces of the people doing it now i'm like horrified ah that's wet we were gonna eat them fresh for the record okay this is literally how long has it been since we got this like 30 seconds 30 seconds or less so the sauce is in the center which i like pull one of these off okay first bite didn't have any salt hmm it seems like unevenly salted i don't know how it's possible because i know it's the salts in the batter get a little sauce sauce is gonna be a no for me like that vic you wanna take that to the bathroom that's sassy i feel like this should be crispier how do i be nice vikram help the thing that makes this good is there's just this huge volume of fried food with like an okay dipping sauce but everything seems kind of flat some parts are salty some parts are not look i know this isn't supposed to be some michelin starred food but i already know exactly how we can make this better this is one of the easiest recipes we've ever done on butt better isn't that fun you're welcome so before we begin obliterating our onyo let's first make our spicy mayo in a small bowl add 1 cup or 230 grams of mayonnaise 2 teaspoons or 10 grams of whole grain mustard 1 tablespoon or 10 grams of garlic powder 1 teaspoon or 4 grams of jalapeno powder which if you don't have the link is in the description for that 2 teaspoons or 7 grams of aleppo pepper 1 teaspoon or 4 grams of chipotle powder two teaspoons or ten milliliters of worcestershire sauce hey that was good one tablespoon or 14 milliliters of lemon juice season that taste with salt and pepper and give that some whiskey yeah you thought anyway that is our final lovely spicy mayo not too spicy but just spicy enough okay next let's talk you can really use any onion you want even little baby cipollini onions but i personally prefer sweet onions for this obviously the sweetness is nice and they just get a nice texture when they're cooked this way you'll need one of the three sweet onions depending on how many of these you're making i don't know what you'd call this but uh to assemble i guess you'll start by cutting off the top leaving the root attached to peel off all the skin in the first layer of onion then place it cut side down and then while leaving that root end intact make a cut from the outside of the root all the way down like this and repeat that in three more equally spaced quadrants to give you a quartered uh onion then repeat that cut in three more equally spaced slices in between each quadrant so that it looks like this once you repeat that to every quadrant you should be left with uh one of these weird looking things there is a machine that does this fun fact that's not really worth the money so i guess get it if you're gonna make it a bunch now flip it over gently sort of like a facehugger esque onion repeat that with one to two more onions and place to the side alright dredge station the first thing you'll need is a seven quart heavy bottom pot for that just a little over halfway with oil for frying and heat that bad boy to 375 fahrenheit now while that's heating we'll first make our wet dip that's a nice trim huh in a medium sized bowl crack in two eggs in the majority of the shell remove the shell because you made in then add 1 tablespoon or 10 grams of garlic powder 1 tablespoon or 12 grams of jalapeno powder 2 teaspoons or 9 grams of fine sea salt give that a whisk until thoroughly combined then whisk in 1 cup or 240 milliliters of milk and half a cup or 120 milliliters of buttermilk and that is your [Music] okay that's enough now for your dredge in a large bowl add one and a half cups or 225 grams of all-purpose flour one and a half tablespoons or 24 grams of cornstarch 1 tablespoon or 10 grams of garlic powder 2 teaspoons or 8 grams of smoked paprika 1 teaspoon or 4 grams of chipotle powder 1 teaspoon or 4 grams of coriander powder 2 and a half teaspoons or 12 grams of fine sea salt then use a smaller whisk than intended because you know cute and give that a nice whisk until thoroughly combined and you have your dredge okay it's time look let's not over complicate this odd dish first give your onion a nice coating in your flour mixture get it in every little crevice then toss it in the way really get in every flower bit one of the annoying things with this process is the individual layers tend to stick to each other so uh really try to get into where the sun doesn't shine if you know what i mean the of the onion calm down buddy then place that back into the flour to get that dredge nice and caked on to every little sliver then very very carefully like wow this could be super dangerous if you're not careful lower your onion into your oil and if it seems like the pot is overfilled and could spill over please stop take some oil out and then put it back in again danger once the whole onion is in there let it sit and fry for about three to five minutes or until you pull out an ultra crisp golden brown uh bloomin onion that's of course cooked all the way through okay we don't want any crunchy onion in here that's gross remove it from the hot oil and let it drain a bit hit it with some additional salt immediately while it's still sizzling hot then place it in a bowl jam a ramekin or small pinch bowl in the center filled with spicy mayo of course and well that's actually it you can repeat this as many times as you need to for as many blooming onions as you want now let's see if our onion lands in the good old outback maybe even farther would you look at that they both look similar mine looks a little bit lighter i could have gone heavier on the paprika let's be honest paprika primarily adds color and some flavor the first true test that it opens and it blooms i would say that this bloomed second test i think we're at a good spot oh yeah it's come to my attention that this dish just isn't really that exciting but we've managed to find a way to make it exciting for one i know they're frying this in the same thing as everything else so this tastes like all those things in one this has a cleaner flavor it's salted better it's got a better crunch there's spice layers of flavor now let's get a sauce dip test busting you can go out buy this this is easier to pay for there's no work at all the expense is a little much so we can say it's about cheaper but if you make this you're actually going to have texture flavor involved with what you're eating without that being said we need a taste tester vikram has already tasted something so kendrick that leaves you buddy yay kendrick's back in town you've never left town is this gonna be a thing where i have to hold it and put it in my mouth or are you gonna put it in my mouth [Music] [Applause] number two [Music] my guess saying which one is yours or which or am i saying which one i like better i mean you could do either or i'm gonna say the one that i like better is the first one that's mine so that's your whoa hey okay you see i was very afraid i was very afraid of saying which one i thought was yours people on here that don't work for us i'm just like oh oh am i still hired after today's tasting yeah no i like the first one a lot better the seasonings are a lot more distinct i can't believe he thought the second one was mine for a second no i didn't no i didn't there was a silence that scared me and it was like oh but yeah no that first one was way better that first one had a lot more distinctive flavor and the second one was also kind of soggy my lady number one yeah that's two oh whoa um oh that second one's so much better oh there's a bit of a kick i'm assuming that's yours it's mine yeah oh my god that's so good this is going to be terrible for my stomach yeah he's been pooping a lot lately that was awesome thank you you're welcome long story short this is a mindless food it's a finger food it's not always about like the greatest eating experience of all time but why not elevate it in the first place that's what butt better is all about and it's cheaper this is basically a butt cheaper too you want to know what else looks like a borderline horror novel-esque onion b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our blooming onion what was my final thought well my final thoughts are the same i still don't like the blooming onion for what it is structurally you could literally follow this recipe and just do it with rings and it would be in my opinion a lot better that's just my two cents let's talk about the flavor big dub much better the intensity of the sauce obviously everything's scaled way up in flavor but hey if you don't want to take the time to do all the little cuts and then be annoying with it again i'm recommending rings and for two of course you could just go out and get it it's also like shockingly expensive but anyway

things in one [Music] okay hang on one second quick plug in one week the cookbook launches and we're hosting a special discord q a it's one of the few places that we do this matter of fact one of the

link in the description join if you haven't already papa keys and uh moving on to the next thing all right okay so today we're making bibimbap is that right pretty good yeah is it bibumbap or bibimbap this is it the how to pronunciation guide all right i cook food calm down but also let me know in the comments what you think huh i'm not picking you pick one this dish is basic and yet complex at the same time it consists of a multitude of accoutrements each individual piece being cared for love done as it deserves and then assembled beautifully atop rice and finally mixed together with a fried egg where the yolk creates another sauce with the rest of the sauce all the vegetables and meat or if you want to do tofu do tofu it's up to you but the beautiful thing about this dish is that anyone can enjoy it how they want so with all that said let's make this shall we right if you've never had bibimbap then sit your butt down and listen up there are a lot of components here and do yourself a favor and don't skimp on any of them that's what makes bibimbap beautiful it's the variety of flavors and textures that make it so special okay oh yes one of our best friends rice so beautiful when it's cooked properly for this recipe you'll need two cups of uncooked medium or short grain rice here i opted for short grain tamaki gold you should know the drill by now wash your gat dang rass you put the rice in a sieve fill the bowl up with water agitate pour it out and repeat one more time how many times have i said this now guys at this point there shouldn't be a single one of you that's not washing your rice if you're using a proper rice cooker then you'll place it in that with equal parts water so two cups or 480 milliliters of water close it and turn it on and uh yeah next we have our bibimbap sauce this is essential in a medium-sized bowl add three tablespoons of rice vinegar two and a half tablespoons of mirin two teaspoons of dark soy sauce one tablespoon of honey five tablespoons of gochujang two teaspoons of toasted sesame oil two cloves of garlic that have been grated and two teaspoons of grated ginger then give it a classic [Music] until completely combined and looking luscious like this now let's talk about my meat or your meat first you'll need one pound of ribeye cut that into quarter inch slices or as thin as you can get it then separately you'll need half a pound of boneless short rib that you'll also get sliced equally as thin toss it into a medium bowl and then to that you're gonna add four cloves of garlic finely chopped a quarter cup of sweet soy sauce one tablespoon of dark soy sauce one tablespoon of rice vinegar two teaspoons of sesame oil one tablespoon of honey then just toss that together until everything is completely and evenly coated cover that and marinate in the fridge for at least 20 minutes but ideally overnight now while it's marinating we can focus on the rest of our goods speaking of marination let's talk mushrooms a lot of people like to just cook their mushrooms like normal or use dried mushrooms but this of course being a grand culinary poppy recipe then we have to take it further first make the marinade by getting a sauce pot that's way too large which means it should have been more of a medium-ish sized one then add half a cup of white distilled vinegar half a cup of mirin half a cup of soy sauce two bay leaves five cloves of garlic lightly crushed but left hole one shallot halved or quartered place it on the stove and begin heating until just steamy hot but don't boil it separately i've got myself about one pound of baby king oyster mushrooms slice those bad boys into quarter inch planks and toss them in oil that's around 350 degrees fahrenheit and let them fry stirring them around occasionally until they get to a rich deep golden brown you intentionally want to dry them out a bit it's okay that they're dry that's kind of the point then place your extra mushrooms directly in your hot marinade then pour all that into a container and let it sit until cooled completely and that's your mushroom look the longer these sit the better they taste so store this in the fridge for honestly quite a while but i doubt they'll last long because they're so gemmy okay we're making good headway here let's move on to our cucumber get one seedless english cucumber cut it in a half inch coins now while this is optional and you know how i feel about optional extra stuff i definitely think it's worth it so simply score both sides of each coin in a crosshatch pattern obviously don't cut all the way through and then season them lightly with salt and let them cure at room temp for 15 minutes for one this will make sure the salt gets penetrated all the way to the center and it gets rid of excess water now you should see that they have released that water so drain that give them a light rinse now to those cukes you'll add two tablespoons of spicy chili crisp lemon juice to taste and two cloves of garlic grated fresh now give that a nice stir until totally coated and combined and those are some of the most addicting cucumbers of your life also at this point you can realize that you should have cut these into quarters but it's fine coins are okay too next up the carrot component one of my favorites a medium-sized bowl add one tablespoon of ginger grated fresh ginger three cloves of grated garlic one tablespoon of fish sauce one tablespoon of gochugaru stir that together until combined and paste like then snag yourself one and a half pounds of oddly girthy carrots peel them and julienne them beautifully toss them in the paste and you essentially have a fresh carrot kimchi next garlicky spinach in a large pan add a light drizzle of toasted sesame oil heat over medium heat add 1 bunch of fresh spinach season a taste with salt and let that cook stirring often until completely wilted but still a nice vibrant green cut the heat add 3 cloves of very finely chopped garlic and place it in a bowl to the side that's it see there's a lot of components but many just take a couple of minutes now despite the fact that i hate these in most scenarios we now have bean sprouts also what an awful name by the way bean sprouts anyway get a medium sized pot of water boiling add two cups of bean sprouts in batches boil for 30 seconds then immediately toss in ice water until chilled to stop the cooking process remove and drain on a paper towel then repeat this blanching process for the rest of your bean sprouts now in a separate small saucepan add three tablespoons of vegetable oil and three cloves of thinly sliced garlic bring that up over medium heat while continuously stirring now first the garlic will start to bubble then basically it'll start frying let it fry stirring off that until it reaches a golden brown toasted color and i know you know that smells buoyant now cut off the heat add your blanched bean sprouts toss the coat then toss with two teaspoons of fish sauce and that's your toasty blanched bean sprouts okay we have the majority of our components except for our steak so crack open a cold one with boys and pop open that grill now a normal grill is fine but if you take this real serious partner then i would suggest using a conroe grill you know the kind grilled over hot bichotin but hey do your thing pick whatever you like so get that bad boy loaded up with white hot bean chotan put on your grates now once that is screaming hot i mean this thing needs to be hot grill your beef in batches and i like to grill my pieces for about 30 seconds to a minute on very very high heat to pick up color without losing too much juice be careful to avoid cooking this stuff for too long otherwise it'll turn dry and leathery and you might as well just go to a boot store at that point once all of your beef is beautifully cooked grilled to smoky deliciousness we officially have everything we need to assemble i mean look at this nice spread just wanna kiss it now for assembly get a shallow bowl and as obvious as you might have guessed lay down a generous layer of your steamed rice i like to flatten it so it's nice and even sort of like a moonlike mountainous terrain now add your mushrooms along with some of its lovely marinade gently drizzled on top then your spinach then some of your bean sprouts carrots looking lovely cucumbers glistening in all their glory and then a big old chunky stack of your fatty beautifully smoky grilled beef my lord that mate about to make me act up now wait a minute what could we be missing right something doesn't look right i guess the piece the resistance of a bibimbap a nice fried egg right in the center which literally is just fried egg with salt nothing too crazy but here's a little trick for you when you're frying your egg and you crack it in the hot pan to quickly cook the whites on top of the egg once the bottom of the egg is set gently base the top of the egg with hot oil until it's puffed and cooked to your liking but leave that yogrunny if you're real wow here we are it's time to put this in my mouth on camera for the world to see and give you my verdict on this here lovely bowl all right this is already premixed it's lost its beauty okay but it hasn't lost it's luster this has history do i know all about it no but i do know how to make it so here we are already mixed together it's rice it's like everything you want where do i begin it's busting but not for any ordinary way to bust what i'm trying to say is there's a lot of layers to what makes this beautiful and amazing for those who know bibimbap you already know what makes this special but it's every varying texture spicy sweet acidic salty beefy or any meat that you happen to put in it who knows maybe you're a vegan and you put tofu in it that's fine that's fine so with all the different layers of richness the fattiness from the beef you got this rich fish sauce salty cucumber with lots of umami and msg because there is msg in the spicy chili crisp that's why i like it the richness gets cut by the freshness of the carrot the fresh crunch of the bean sprout and i hate bean sprouts i hate them there's only two contexts in which i like them in this and in pad thai but my favorite thing about this entire bowl and i could honestly just have this rice with egg and the marinated mushroom that is key if you're gonna make anything out of this recipe make the marinated mushroom or maybe you're just watching for fun and if you're watching for fun thank you if you're making something also thank you so with all that said uh we're just gonna go to your all you wanna know what else is full of multiple components that are specifically made to go into your mouth b-roll all right guys and that is it so we made our bibimbap it came out beautifully it's one of those dishes that i think looks beautiful just about any way you choose to do with that egg in the center surrounded by different colors and different vegetables and this is a beautiful thing how do you not want that like every day the thing that's cool is if you make a big batch of each individual component you just leave that in the fridge whip up some steamed rice and then top it up the same way every time it's a beautiful meal that you easily stir together and eat it can be easy if you prep i don't really talk about meal prep that much on here because it's kind of an annoying process and i don't really like it so that yeah that's how i feel about it so anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned

138,138,Making Wendy's Spicy Chicken Nuggets | But Better,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U6Ncna5YzHY/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBD3sp8L3qDdR9EhbgxLirnDmRkoQ,U6Ncna5YzHY,"11 minutes, 43 seconds","Homemade chicken nuggets usually aren't very good. That's why people go to Wendy's to get the spicy nuggets, and as usual, we will be challenging that today.

Get My Cookbook: http://bit.ly/JWCookb...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, mcdonald's nuggets were easy chick-fil-a nuggets were easy surprisingly i don't think this one's gonna shake us [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today we're making wendy's spicy nuggets we have a couple of different options i was gonna go regular apparently nobody likes the regular ones people choose the spicy ones eight times out of ten over the normal ones which seems out of sorts so we're only doing the spicy ones you don't want them to be spicy well guess what take the spice out of it anything that like cayenne like take that out of it you see where we're going with that i don't think this needs more of an introduction so with all that said let's make this shall we oh my god it's wendy's oh i pulled in too early don't be scared victor don't be scared all right we're at wendy's you know what i've always found funny about wendy's the outside always looks like a wendy's but whenever you go in i've noticed that it is always hands down the ugliest interior of any fast food restaurant even mcdonald's has upgraded it and i have no respect for them vikram has informed me that they have been updated this one just happens to be ugly can i get two 10-piece spicy chicken nuggets do you have the sauce sauce oh bummer oh my god they should probably jesus fix the drive-thru wendy's thank you so much okay so we're on our way back and this somehow this doesn't smell it smells like french fries i can't complain about that we've got the they're doing it again this was cool in the graphic design industry in 2011 it's since moved on all the corporations are like that's what the kids liked right and they're like john that was like 15 years ago please he's like what it was just yesterday because john's like 85. your break fast could have been free chill out there's also like a whole paragraph on the back before you eat your chicken nuggets who's reading this i'm gonna read it oh it's a promotional i thought it would be funny okay really that's all you get bon appetit you're gonna starve wait a minute hold on did we know that that wendy's was established in 69 we can end the video right here all right bye textually okay what's the hype what's special about this it's spicy i like the spice that's nice there's like a cheesy note here's my verdict the mcdonald chicken nugget is actually surprisingly better than this these are drab there's not that much chicken flavor the texture's nice the salt level is subpar the spice is good it's about a 3.268 out of 10. and we're going to make a 10. okay we have yet another ground chicken nugget by that i mean they aren't using whole pieces of meat it's actually ground and formed chicken and all i know everyone gets all grossed out oh wait it's ground no it's really not that big of a deal it's no different than you like meatballs guess what same thing i actually don't mind if it's done properly so to do that you'll first make your knife look like rubber yeah don't do this actually this was done by a professional well uh professional in the sense of cuisine maybe not circus acts anyway you'll need two boneless and skinless chicken breasts and one boneless and skinless chicken thought i had to debone my own because i completely forgot that mine were unprocessed but it's a good thing that papa likes to do that to that you'll add about a quarter cup or 50 grams of finely chopped chicken skin then you'll add 2 teaspoons or 9 grams of granulated sugar 1 tablespoon or 12 grams of kosher salt 1 teaspoon or four grams of msg one teaspoon or five grams of ground white pepper and one tablespoon or thirteen grams okay ran out of breath there garlic powder mix that together until thoroughly combined and run that through a meat grinder which again if you have a stand mixer you really need to get this attachment link is in the description this is not a sponsored thing i just love it so much or you can use pre-ground chicken and you'll just have to skip the ability to control the fat content which is like kind of a bummer bro once all of your chicken is ground you could stop there but if you want it extra juicy you can add half a cup or 75 grams of soy protein concentrate which is used to help sausages or in this case chicken nuggets retain their moisture i also decided to beat in 2 tablespoons or 30 grams of duck fat because why not anyway add that to your chicken mixture mix that together until completely incorporated and then from there you'll shape your chicken into nuggets dipping your hands in water intermittently to keep it from sticking to your hands and you'll shape into rough ovals you know like chicken nugget shapes placing them on a parchment lined and greased baking sheet as you complete each nugget these are quarter sheet trays and just to emphasize the shaping on this we're gonna stick to the traditional wendy's shape my only suggestion is to not make them the actual size at this point because they will get larger when they fry so make them a little smaller unless you want nuggets once your nuggets are shaped pop those bad boys into the freezer for 30 minutes to firm up in the meantime let's make our spicy chicken in a blender you're gonna combine three tablespoons or 55 grams of spicy chili crisp solids yes the good stuff three cloves of garlic two tablespoons of rice vinegar blend that bad boy on high speed until relatively smooth and maybe you know little few chunky bits in there that's fine then to a small bowl add 2 3 of a cup or 158 grams of mayonnaise your spicy chili crisp mixture 2 teaspoons or 9 grams of honey 2 teaspoons or 10 grams of cayenne powder 2 teaspoons or 10 grams of smoked paprika salt to taste then give that some [Music] business until thoroughly combined and velvety is all get out next up set up your breading station for the flour dredge you'll need one and a half cups or 225 grams of all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon or 4 grams of sugar 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of kosher salt 1 tablespoon or 13 grams of sweet paprika 1.5 teaspoons or 5 grams of cayenne and 1 teaspoon or 4 grams of msg whisk that together no whiskey business on this one buddy until thoroughly combined and freer dip you'll need three whole eggs two teaspoons or seven grams of fresh cracked black pepper two teaspoons or seven grams of msg two teaspoons or eight grams of garlic powder one teaspoon or five grams of onion powder one tablespoon or 14 grams of kosher salt 2 teaspoons or 10 grams of cayenne powder i just realized how many spices are in this all right look it's a spicy chicken nugget but do you think there wasn't gonna be a lot of spices in it get over yourself one and a half tablespoons or 16 grams of smoked paprika 1 teaspoon or 5 grams of granulated sugar then give that an absolute unit of a whisk until thoroughly combined and then whisk in a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of buttermilk now last but not least you'll need a third separate bowl containing two cups or 150 grams of panko bread crumbs okay we're ready to dredge and fry first make sure you have a pot of vegetable oil that's been heated at 350 degrees fahrenheit and to bread that pull out your now firmed nugs first give them a toss to coat completely in the flour mixture shake off the excess inspect your nugget for any bald spots and if there are none then and only then are you allowed to jump to the egg dip so drop it on in there coat the nugget thoroughly let the excess drip off and then finally into the panko to coat completely until no dry spots remain place a nugget on a baking sheet lightly coated with more panko that just keeps it from sticking and repeat this process with each and every little nugget optionally giving each and everyone a kiss as you finish once all of your nuggets are breaded all you gotta do is gently place them into your oil as many as you can get in there but you'll likely need to do this in two to three batches to avoid overcrowding your oil then just let those gentlemen fry for three to five minutes or until you pull out a sizzling voluptuous crisp and beautifully golden brown chicken nugget worthy of its own holiday i mean there's a holiday for everything now for some reason when did this become a thing god damn look at that juice this is a juicy feather right there now at this point all we need to do is flip dip hook into the mouth and figure out if we did it yet again i will say that visually these do look a little too different but hey let's let the good old-fashioned taste test tell us okay so we've made it now let me make a quick point i already know people can be like josh that doesn't look like the right branding that's because it's not all right i just realized that after making this developed the recipe late last night and i'm realizing wait a minute this should have been a classic buttermilk flour dredge and guess what you can still make that just use the same exact spices for the egg wash in two cups of flour then just dip them in buttermilk and do that that's how you make it but nonetheless the flavors will be identical it's just a slight textural difference so we'll be aware of that but with that being said these they're just not that crisp they have a little bit of crisp these on the other hand obviously being have maybe we were right in choosing this breading in the first place unadulterated no sauce good lord have mercy a couple of knows about this nugget right off the bat deep chickeny perfect flavor the only downside is if you let nuggets sit they dry out a little bit but this these have got the juice it's almost like you're about to sit down and it's cold outside and it's just warm blanket wraps around you grabs your butt cheeks and just gives it a light sort of just like yearning clench that's the spice level in this it's very nice comparatively to this wow the flavors are completely different these sit better i will say that there is zero flavor in this in comparison i mean zero there's spice and that's it they didn't have this awesome sauce so we made our own i mean that's ridiculous this shouldn't be that good i wonder if it makes this nugget any better it does guys we butt-bettered their nugget by me coating it in a sauce that i made that completely overwhelms whatever this is i think we won on every front on the flavor but i can't say that we won on the breading because it's too different i wanna pay respect to that so we're gonna gauge this on flavor and we won in that regard i'm not gonna let you touch this but i'm also afraid you're gonna bite my fingers close your ears that was a ploy all right you gotta close your ears again option b a b one two what's the difference yours is the first one and better this isn't a guessing game you win i i see what you're saying this does hold on a bit better but yeah it is just spice this has good spice and i don't think there's anything wrong with this these are a lot thicker have a lot more flavor it's juicier you kind of taste like the more real chicken aspect to it obviously oh this is real chicken but the breading is different i kind of like the panko breading a little more feels a little more complete now it's what it should be the sauce is so good i love spicy chili crisp takes it to another level we had our conversation we looked at it both ways i would say in most aspects we won this it's not a complete win if we'd done the breading right this would have been a win that's what i'm considering let us know what you think in the comments but either way wait i don't end this like that you want to know what else is full of unbelievably juicy meatballs surrounded with a crunchy crust b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our i uh wendy's not chick-fil-a nuggets they were spicy they were delicious in my opinion i would say that this doesn't feel like a full win only because the breading wasn't perfect with that being said we could have very easily done that just by doing a traditional buttermilk and flour dredge like we've done any of these other times like when we've done kfc like when we've done chick-fil-a like when we've done literally any fried chicken video okay so you know i can do this i did go the panko route i looked at an image i haven't had them in so long so i feel like i'm making excuses right now because i am but the point is that the flavor the texture the nugget itself was a better nugget we'll give it an 8 out of 10 win that is that is that a way to can you even do that so

The world’s no. 1 pizza oven company, known for bringing portable pizza ovens to backyards all over the world. Thanks to new design...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, we've done many a pizza on this channel some of the most legendary but today we're making the king of all pizzas [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today we're making neapolitan pizza instead of just doing that i thought well let's take two traditional pizzas put them together and see if there's a true winner it's gonna be a traditional neapolitan pizza margarita and a traditional roman pizza there are many kinds but one specific kind battle it out when it comes to a proper italian pizza there is no corner cutting because if you cut the corner then the italians they cut you they're probably watching right now thinking like what's he gonna do better that presents a major challenge how do you do it at home is it even possible and that's where today's sponsor uni comes in if you're at all into the cooking space and you watch cooking channels or you're into food or whatever there's i don't see how it's even physically possible that you've never heard of an uni pizza oven it is the answer to all of your home pizza oven questions you ever had i know this is sponsored but i've cooked in a lot of different ovens in my career and all i have to say is this is genuinely the best home pizza oven that's not like gigantic in a massive dome that takes up like 500 square feet of space that makes the most beautiful perfectly cooked neapolitan pizza i've ever had and it goes beyond that you can cook vegetables and all sorts of things in it but today we're talking about neapolitan pizzas so with all that said let's make this shall we okay we're gonna keep this a clean organized firm yet delicate fight not sure if that's even possible so we have two italian pizzas here a classic neapolitan pizza done as close to tradition as physically possible but within the home and a roman style pizza but wait not just any roman pizza specifically pizza altario italians how's that huh pretty good get a rating very nice either we have smiling italians or they're already in the comments yelling at me thank you let's begin with my personal favorite neapolitan i need everyone to just take a step back and listen up brother there are rules here let us consult the holy book the pizza number one the sauce must contain san marzano tomatoes number two the flower must be type zero or double zero number three it must be cooked within 60 to 90 seconds at around 800 fahrenheit let it be known this isn't even close to all the rules but we also don't have our entire lives to write them all out but we're going to stick as close as possible to these rules while at home so first let's start with our dough which is the foundation here start off with 512 grams of filtered water heated exactly to 95 fahrenheit and you see how i said exact i mean exact papa no kiss if you know keep exact numbers so to your water you're gonna add three to four grams of instant yeast if it's more warm and humid in your area then go with the lower number in yeast sew that together and let that sit for five minutes then in a large bowl add 800 grams of double o tepo flour followed by 16 grams of fine sea salt mix that together with the flour until incorporated into your flour add all of your water and mix by hand yes you want to touch the dough to create the connection of human and pizza mix that just until a shaky dough forms in the flour is fully hydrated cover with plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 20 minutes from there you'll remove your dough from the bowl place it on a work surface give it some good old slap [Music] oh you don't know what slap and folding is it's actually exactly what it sounds like you pick the dough up you slap the bottom of it down then throw and fold it over itself then repeat that by picking it up not from the sides but actually front to back like this and then repeat the slap and fold motion for about one to two minutes or until the dough starts to turn smooth transfer that back to your bowl and rest for 15 more minutes then you guessed it brother once again slap and fold for one to two more minutes or until the dough is very supple and hardly sticks to the counter roll it into a top ball grease your bowl with extra virgin olive oil and place it back into the bowl cover completely with plastic wrap and i mean if you're neurotic like me then really you want to cater wrap this now place in the refrigerator for your dough sun to have a beautiful slumber for 14 to 18 hours this is essential in developing additional flavor in the dough but could transversely be done at room temp in about four to six hours once your little man has had a good night's rest give him a kiss then punch all of the air out of him leaving him deflated and ready to shape into what you desire not what he desires just kidding his life goal is to become a neapolitan pizza to keep things exact you're then going to divide your dough into five even pieces which should be really about 250 grams each then squish out any excess air fold the sides to the middle flip it so it's seam side down and then roll it in circles on the counter keeping constant contact with the counter until you get a medium ball place that into a proofing box or rimmed baking sheet that's dusted with flour and repeat with all of your pieces of dough be sure to leave at least one and a half inches of space in between each ball to account for spreading when they now cover that with its lid or another inverted rim baking sheet and let that proof at room temp for three to four hours or until they're easy to stretch and maneuver and very lightly puffed while those are proofing let's quickly make our sauce very simply you'll need one 24 ounce can of proper peeled san marzano tomatoes or fresh ones if you can get them blast if you can take them out of the can and lightly squeeze out their excess water out over a sieve set in a bowl add all of your flesh ah that's tomato flesh two food processor along with two cloves of garlic and two and a half tablespoons or 35 milliliters of extra virgin olive oil process that until extremely smooth season the taste with salt in an optional light pinch of sugar to mellow the acidity blend that in then just pass through a fine mesh sieve or xinhua really be sure to push out as much of the pulp as you can leaving only the seeds behind otherwise you'll just have tomato water then there you go that's your fresh tomato sauce for the cheese you just need buffalo mozzarella but if you want to get specific anything from campagna will likely be ideal and if it's super moist then drain it on a paper towel to you know get that moistness to calm down brother all right before you shape your pizza you're going to preheat your pizza oven here i'm using the brand new uni karu 16. pick your fuel of choice you want to do whole wood then pop in your wood light up and let her rip you want charcoal cool toss those bad boys in and let hell fire rain down upon it or if you want to be mr scientist and fully control the temperature then connect it to a big fatty propane tank and get it pumping whichever fuel option you want is up to you but whatever you do just let it pre-heat for 15 minutes until it reaches 800 to 850 degrees fahrenheit yes it's that quick and the chances of you getting that in a home oven is virtually impossible unless you develop some kind of rig that allows it to reach a temperature like that but i'm pretty sure if you do that the fire marshall now once your oven is piping hot snack a dough around and place it on a generously floured pizza peel flour the top of your round and then using your fist punch it down leaving a very thin border that's slightly thicker than the rest and once you're done drip the dough over closed fists and stretch and turn by hand repeatedly until you get about 10 to 12 inch circle from there top it with just a couple tablespoons of your fresh tomato sauce spread it around evenly followed by a few pieces of torn mozzarella and a few leaves of basil all right here they come oh josh you can't go shut up i've seen it done both ways literally in italy and you can debate all you want in the comments but this pizza cooks in 90 seconds or less and the flavor can still contribute greatly but if you're that worried you can always add it at the end for the freshness of its own flavor it's basil okay relax from there carefully open up your uni slide it in close the door and let it cook for 30 to 45 seconds or until puffed and one side starts to get some char then quickly turn it 180 degrees close the door and let it cook for another 30 to 45 seconds for an evenly lightly charred pizza to emerge steaming and gleaming once you've pulled it out hit it with a light drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and optionally a light sprinkle of flaky salt and fresh cracked black pepper and that is your pizza simply repeat with the rest of your dough and now you can enjoy the most beautifully blistered puffy and luxuriously aerated pizza so good that angels will sing cry just for you and that pizza okay we got that out of the way so now we just need to worry about mr roman surprisingly easier start with 432 grams of warm water around 95 fahrenheit and whisk in seven grams of instant yeast place it to the side then in a large bowl mix together 600 grams of bread flour you can do double o tepo but red flour actually works better here and 12 grams of fine sea salt now once your yeast is bloomed whisk in two tablespoons or 30 milliliters of extra virgin olive oil and then pour all that into your flour mix then it's the exact same mixing method as before mix by hand till just shaggy cover and let rest for 15 to 20 minutes by the way resting period important don't try and skip it papa no kiss all right anyway slap and fold rest 15 minutes slap and fold again then cover and place in the fridge for 14 to 18 hours see what i'm saying it's easy the next day get yourself a good old-fashioned baking sheet coat it generously with olive oil then dump your dough which has been degassed not like farted but you know you punch it punch it down that's de-gassing anyway gently spread it out as close to the edges as you can it will resist a little bit just keep trying it'll get there cover that with another inverted baking sheet wrap tightly with plastic wrap and proof at room temperature for two hours and while that's proofing let's make our sauce and toppings oh also preheat your oven to 500 degrees fahrenheit because it's gonna take some time to get hot who's this dunking for the sauce you're gonna add two ounces or 56 grams of diced pancetta full of a tablespoon or so of olive oil in a medium saucepan heat that over medium heat there's a lot of heating and mediums going on right now once that starts to render its fat out let it cook stirring occasionally for about two to four minutes or until your pancetta is brown and quick then add four cloves of thinly sliced garlic saute that for about a minute or until toasted and golden brown optionally you can toss in a teaspoon of red chili flakes if you need a little bit of spice smooth it in and let that toast then add in 1 24 ounce can of crushed san marzano tomatoes stir that together bring it to a boil then lower the heat to low and let that simmer for 5 minutes or until slightly reduced season a taste with salt and a small pinch of sugar to curb the acidity then stir in 4 tablespoons or 60 milliliters of extra virgin olive oil and that right there is a knee slapping good time of the sauce now since this pizza is a big man we're gonna do three different toppings on one pizza a mushroom onion topping a plain cheese topping which is the base i guess and a pepperoni for the mushroom topping it's real simple start with six ounces or 170 grams of button mushrooms cut those into eights or quarters depending on their size in a large skillet add just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan entirely heat it over medium high until ripping hot then add in your mushrooms cut side down trying not to overcrowd and let that sear for about two minutes or until deeply browned give them a toss let them continue to cook until soft then season your taste with salt and black pepper and that's your mushroom now place those in a bowl clean out the same pan heat it back up over medium-high add another tablespoon or so of oil and add in one rough diced onion saute that for four minutes or just until softened season a taste with salt add to your mushrooms then to that you're gonna add one teaspoon of finely chopped fresh thyme leaves tossed together and that's your onyo mushroom for the pepperoni well you just need to slice pepperoni it's not that crazy okay it's not rocket science it's uh it's pepperoni science okay you should know that by now and if you want to be a real g of course you'll slice your own pepperoni and you'll slice her nice and i went just under a half inch for each of my slices what can i say like i'm chunky now last of all is the cheese mix you'll need about two and a half cups of grated low moisture mozzarella and three quarters of a cup of fresh grated parmigiano reggiano i think that was my best pronunciation of that ever it's pretty good right can i just get a round of applause please just make me feel good about it now toss those together and you have a cheesy man now let's say you've got your proof dough nice and you've got the sauce plus toppings oh nice dude now you are allowed to assemble first take your dough's top off hit it with a nice generous layer of sauce spread it around to coat the dough evenly you will likely end up using about three quarters of your sauce the rest you can keep in the fridge for your pleasure it's a papa pleasure if you will from there let it rain a torrential downpour of cheese to your heart's desire across the entire pizza leaving a slight border then hit a third of the pizza with your onyo mushroom another third of it with well nothing because it's just cheese in a third with your pepperoni which is arranged generously now pop that into your oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until the cheese is deeply browned and caramelized oh we said burn josh no okay some parts are a touch charred all right but we want the cheese deeply brown is there a problem with that no it just means a little bit of quiff kind of like a nice lasagna now optionally you could top your onion mushroom with some frise and fresh shaved parmigiano-reggiano but that's up to you this finalizes our second and last pizza which will it be the famous classic neapolitan or the roman altalio you know for the party people one is a little more upscale and one is meant for a crowd so let's taste test this bit and see if there's a true winner it's hot in here it's hot outside and it's hot as in that uni oven thank you yeah i was going to say the same thing it's funny because the pizza speaks for itself good lord the bottom's charred the outsized chard a little bit of acidity just the smell you know your brain your caveman-like mind goes this is yummy put it in you so he will and just a quick oh my lord look at this crumb structure here we go let me just stop myself for a second here i feel like i've been transported to a terrace in italy i wake up and then i'm like oh i'm in houston but hey this pizza brought me to a moment of bliss and that's because of that precious oven now neapolitan pizza aside let's talk about the roman style pizza now there are many different kinds of roman pizza we went with the al talio not the best pronunciation okay pepperoni a cheese and whatever this is i kind of want the onion one that's pretty blessing too this is a totally different experience crunch of the crust ultra rich deeply flavored it like punches you in the face you taste it and it tastes good and then i don't know where the flavor's just like you're dead you die but then the flavor of being so good brought you back to life so you died then you were resuscitated by the killer and then the killer was like it's okay you're okay and that was the experience okay so weighing the two different pizzas okay what's it gonna be is there a winner the answer is a no there's not a winner they're completely different pizzas and they both deserve the righteous respect that they are owed what's the choice here which one do you go with obviously this is gonna be my favorite choice neapolitan pizza's been my favorite since i was a child for those who just have a home of and you can also just do this okay if you don't want to spend the money on a ticket to go to italy um is it the same as going to italy no but it will transport you to a terrace you want to know what's plump puffy and slightly charred yeah i bet you're confused now b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so before i say anything i just want to say a quick thank you to our sponsors uni for helping us out with this video and of course partnering with us and giving us this beautiful oven it's a multi-purpose thing man you choose the gosh darn fuel you make your own thing pop the paints in there throw some broccolini in there got a goddamn mail now these two pizzas battling it out together a true winner it's hard to say i don't know that there really is a true winner it comes down to what you want in that moment but if it was me i'm probably always going to go for a neapolitan pizza it's the most visceral of an experience i feel like the other pizza's more of like you know a party pizza you're with your homies you're like oh i have a little bit of pizza square i mean it's so fun look it's in a square i can cut it with scissors and there's so much it's so voluminous you see where i'm going with this they both serve their purpose there isn't one that's better than the other they're both perfectly delicious but it's up to you to make this pizza and find out for yourself so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time sometimes i feel like i'm talking and nothing's actually happening like i'm not thinking of anything in my brain there's just words coming out of my mouth which i don't fully understand [Music] you
141,141,1 Dollar Fancy Mac and Cheese | But Cheaper,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sn2vSehRHZQ/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAznKI3eufrzDK5TZDxvwyZzt4HAA,sn2vSehRHZQ,"7 minutes, 4 seconds","The average cost of fancy mac and cheese is 7 bucks and above. Obviously, storebought is much cheaper, but making your own oven mac and cheese with multiple kinds of cheese can be done for...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, so mac and cheese isn't really expensive when you go to the store but it sucks but when you go to a restaurant when it's great it's this much for one bowl when you could be making it at home just as fancy for this price right here that is but cheaper [Music] so as i said when you go to a restaurant you get yourself a nice fancy mac and cheese there are whole mac and cheese dedicated restaurants and they're great don't get me wrong i'm not trying to knock them they're fantastic you don't have to make it all sorts of flavors but it is expensive i've seen 25 mac and cheese for a single bowl bro what inflation is real do you read the economist i don't but what i do want you to know this entire pasta dish this entire macaroni dish can be just as fancy just as cheesy just as good have that baked quality that everybody knows and loves just a small price don't you want to save money i'm assuming you do because you're on this series or maybe you just watch hey thanks for the dedication okay with all that said let's make this shall we this is going to be a quick one so you're welcome we recently had a conversation of homemade pasta versus store-bought what's cheaper is there a better one tasting really there isn't a gigantic difference per serving in terms of price so it comes down to what you really want texturally of course homemade's gonna be better but a poster extruder isn't exactly the most cost-effective thing in the world so with all that being said one pound of macaroni it is i hope i don't need to overexplain boiling pasta here right bring a pot of water to a boil season it aggressively with salt you are always going to want to season it borderline as salty as the ocean it is the secret of a proper pasta once it's out of vigorous boil add in your macaroni and cook for just one minute under the original package directions it's around eight to nine minutes now while that's going let's make our mac and cheese sauce which from a culinary perspective is really just a mornay sauce so uh we've had this combo but you know how i feel about that first in a large bowl combine two and a half cups or 470 grams of monterey jack cheese and two and a half cups or 470 grams of sharp cheddar now buying a whole block can sometimes and usually be less expensive than if you choose pre-graded and also pre-graded really sucks i mean it is awful for this purpose then tussle that together until thoroughly combined and that's your cheese mixture next in a large pot add half a cup or 112 grams of unsalted butter heat that over medium heat and once all that butt is hot and melted whisk in half a cup or 75 grams of all-purpose flour let that cook for one minute stirring often then gradually stream and whisk in three cups or 700 milliliters of whole milk and one cup or 240 milliliters of heavy cream was that together and as soon as that is hot add in one and a half cups of your cheese whisk that in until melted then once uh melted add in another one and a half cups of your cheese whisk that in until melted and hot and that's your mornay sauce so silky and cheesy it's as if the drapes of cheesy valhalla are glazing the very earth that we stand upon then just season that to taste with salt optionally you can add some fresh grated nutmeg but that is completely optional and not necessary so i'm not adding it to the price all right i'm not anyway drain your macaroni place that hot mac into your cheese sauce and fold together until thoroughly combined and just lovely please coat this thoroughly you know how i feel about having to talk about bald spots on chicken please please anyway get yourself a 9x13 baking dish grease it lightly add in half of your mac fold by half of your remaining cheese then the other half of your mac perroni then optionally toss the remaining cheese before you top it with 2 teaspoons or five grams of fresh thyme leaves till thoroughly combined and then finally add all of that to the top layer of your mac and cheese and maybe you can add a little extra cheese if you want but be aware that will cost extra because you added extra now all you gotta do is pop it in the oven set the 350 fahrenheit which is also 176 degrees celsius for 20 to 25 minutes or tell jesus from there you can either blast it with your broiler or you can hit it with a kitchen torch until it's browned to your liking now all that's left is a big beautiful spoon but uh nothing comedically large i beg of you don't get into your mac and observe the many many cheese pulls worthy of an angel's tear plop that bad boy onto a plate and let's find out if we made a mac and cheese for this price that can hold its own against a significantly more expensive counterpart okay so we have mccaroni and jeez this is one of the most basic things in the world that already comes cheap as we all know okay but this is fancy we made a roux and then we made a bechamel and then what else did we make a monet sauce i think kraft is making a mornay sauce see there's another trait about mac and cheese before i even eat it and it's this by the way all i did was this i just picked it up and it was just like there's so many layers and experiences of cheese in this for this price per person that's better than any store-bought box mac and cheese you're gonna get you got multiple layers of texture you have a little bit of chew from the cheese in the middle the stretch the crunch of the caramelized cheese on top or brew laid i should say and of course the macaroni is cooked perfectly it has the right texture you could replace the macaroni with any other pasta that you want but this is obviously the cheapest option if you want to raise the price slightly but also have a different eating experience you could use something like this okay but the choice is always yours the the only thing i want you to consider kind of regret doing that i wanted to eat that the only thing i want you to consider just making your own gosh darn mac and cheese of course this is a pretty common typical recipe i just want you to wake up to the reality of it all okay you want to know what else is full of cheese pulled dreams and perfectly al dente pasta [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our mac and this if you think about it mac and cheese is kind of like a french italian combo right roux bechamel mourine and then you put the pasta huh french italian wow one of the few things in america that's kind of got some culture to it everything turned out perfectly was exactly what i wanted there was no difference in flavor between this mac and cheese and any other mac and cheese that i've made on this channel before and yet it was made with the thought of your wallet in mind no sacrifice in time that it takes to make it's easy no sacrifice and flavor and it's cheap what else do you want we're giving you what we want anyway i hope you enjoyed this video and if you did leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time uh [Music] you

Not quite a sushi bowl, not quite a ""deconstructed"" makimono...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, if you love sushi whether it's makimono or henro whatever it doesn't matter and you've never had poke then you're missing out on an entire chunk of life [Music] wait just stop what is a pokeball in essence it's a perfect example of the perfect combinations of food that have been created by hawaiian cuisine it's essentially sashimi and in most cases sashimi tuna that's dressed beautifully in a very sort of japanese influenced sauce marinated with all sorts of good delicious oh my god and sometimes put on top of rice before we get all nitty gritty in this i know that like planting it all crazy and beautiful with the avocado fanned out and a sprinkle of cilantro and this and then it's all organized and it's not usually like that in hawaii okay you eat it straight up and sometimes you have a little side of rice or whatever the point is the marination period the flavors of the fish that's the beauty of it not the rice and all the other fancy stuff it's the fish so we're gonna adhere to the ideals that make a proper hawaiian pokey and maybe elevate a little so we can feel like we're on a nice easy breezy island but you know what else is easy and breezy saving on your home and car insurance and that's where today's sponsor geigo comes in bundling your home and car insurance could save you even more so for bundling made easy visit geiger.com today and visit the link in the description to see how much you could save right out so we've got two bowls for you here a tuna bowl with a ponzu style marinade and a miso or a king salmon bowl very fancy neither of these recipes really require any cook time aside from the rice which is optional so no complaining to papa about oh my gosh it takes so much time no kiss so let's begin with our wee little tuna man in a medium sized bowl combine two to three cloves of garlic very finely chopped two tablespoons or 30 grams of the solids of some angel singing spicy chili crisp one and a half tablespoons are 23 grams of oyster sauce 2 tablespoons are 30 milliliters of shoyu one tablespoon or 14 milliliters of yuzu juice or lemon juice one and a half teaspoons or seven grams of toasted sesame oil one tablespoon or 18 grams of mirin and of course give that the classic tried and true and that's your marinade next you're gonna need 500 grams of sashimi grade tuna from there cut your fish using only long single strokes yeah remember sometimes it's good to have nice slow long single strokes [Music] so you get nice evenly sized half inch cubes if you do it properly you won't tear the flesh of the fish and you'll get nice toit cubes toss that into your marinade bowl give it a very gentle mix by folding it over itself until completely coated in the sauce cover with plastic wrap and leave to marinate in the fridge for at least one hour or up to overnight for the rice just wash it okay please uncle roger and i have told you enough wash your got dang rice it's not even a question of whether or not you do it it's genuinely a question of your heart as a human being at this point once it's been submerged and rinsed underwater two times pop that bad boy into your rice cooker observe a symphony unlike any other oh my god ah stop and let the machine do its thing this is two cups of tomaki sushi rice and two cups of filtered water for those of you who are going to ask next up is fried shallots for this whole recipe you'll need 46 shallots depending on their size cut off their tops leaving the root attached peel them and then slice them as evenly as possible into quarter inch slices place your shallots in a small pot and add enough cold vegetable oil to completely submerge the shallots place it over medium-high heat and let that heat up and cook while constantly stirring with chopsticks and when i say constantly i mean do not stop stirring ever and you'll notice that they begin to slowly cook then fry then those bubbles will begin to subside and the shallots will start to float and once they're about 95 of the way to golden brown and the bubbles have subsided pull them out of the oil and drain immediately on a paper towel season them generously with salt while they're hot and trust me when i say you want to pull these a little bit early because they're going to continue to brown after being removed and nobody likes when someone burns shallots papa no embrace if you burn the shallots now remaining for this bowl you'll need half an english cucumber cut into eighth of an inch thick slices one avocado sliced in a quarter inch thick slices and fanned out lightly then for the herbs you're going to need a good 50 50 mix of thai basil leaves torn and fresh cilantro leaves tossed together however much or as little as you need to assemble the bowl well you're gonna need a bowl silly goose then first add a nice bed of steamed rice so nice you can almost take a nap on it then your sliced avocado some flaky salt a generous spoonful of your marinated tuna along with some of its marinade your sliced cucumber and a nice handful of your herb mix and that's it for monsieur tuna and now we just need to taste test right so typically you can eat this however you want you want to take a little bit of avocado i prefer to give it a little mix you know got all this nice sauce get some of that into the rice and then you get a little bit of everything in one bite the lava little fish little rice i'm gonna build this bite okay right off the bat it's essentially like a sushi roll or a makimono if you will in the format of a bowl but wait there's some sort of tropical freshness to it i'm in hawaii right now the breeze is in my hair it feels nice it feels right completely unhindered basic poke bowl but i wanna take it a step further and do something a little less traditional with salmon okay next up is the little salmon man and it's even easier get a medium-sized bowl add in two tablespoons or 29 grams of mayonnaise nice two tablespoons or 38 grams of white miso 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of sriracha 2 teaspoons or 7 grams of soy sauce give that a nice whisk until completely smooth then stag yourself 500 grams of sashimi grade salmon ideally or a king but you know it's expensive so then just as before slow strokes enslaved salmon into beautiful half-inch cubes add those cubes to the marinade toss to coat thoroughly and feel free to add any spices or acidity here if you wish i added a little bit of togarashi just to give it some spice then just cover that and let that marinate in the fridge for one hour and up to overnight see just like before another thing we need are orange supremes so the way i like to do it is with the petty or paring knife start by cutting across the top where the stem attaches kind of like i'm going to remove the entire top but then stop about three quarters of the way through and this is this is the trick slightly turn your knife so it runs along the orange and then just carefully saw while turning the orange constantly to remove that peel as close to the flesh and pith as possible then just working your way down the entire orange until you have a fully peeled orange like so and she's just beautiful you'll need about three medium oranges peeled like this and once all those are done looking kind of nike you'll notice these sort of membrane vein lines that run along the entire orange using your knife you're gonna cut out the segments in between those lines like so avoid getting any of that membrane in that cut and it'll leave you with a totally tender and juicy piece of orange then repeat that process and get every single segment out of all of your oranges and you've done it look at you being fancy now to assemble the bowl first of course start with your rice obviously next up your salmon hit the salmon with a little togarashi spice and green onion both optional but tasty and it looks nice all right just can you just try then some blanched edamame julienned carrot which can totally be raw and unadulterated or you can pickle them if you're a real culinary high beast by literally just making any of my pickled liquid recipes you know one to two ratio of water to vinegar salt and sugar to taste bring to a boil and pour on your carrots then let them sit at room temp until they are room temp and they are now pickled anyway those go into a bowl i twirled them up because you know gotta do something extra followed by some thinly sliced green cabbage and five to seven orange supreme segments and that is your salmon bowl okay so here we have two different beautiful bowls we've taste tested the other one so let's see if we have an optimal choice do we go tuna or is salmon the better option is it personal preference i don't know brother let's find out wait i'm not i didn't say i was ready vikram just started rolling he didn't even ask if i was already he's like all right ready to go rolling didn't even wait for me that's not vikram that's it enough is enough wow look at this look at the colors is this a rainbow wow there's really only like one color in here that's in the rainbow so mix that together we already talked about how to eat this if you need me to describe it to you again you weren't listening and i'm sick and tired of people not listening now the lawn mowers are on everybody's making noise oh i guess i'll make noise too get a little orange supreme you like that you like that technique you're getting a little flinch nobody eats their poke bowl like this but i want it to be a perfect bite oh yeah this is the one oh it's a little spicy so between these two bowls is there a better one salmon tuna i don't know that i would say that this is better but i would go for this more if you want something a little more relaxed honest poke then you go this route but if you want something higher up multiple textures is juicing in your mouth it's crunchy it's sweet salty fatty rich umami then the salmon bowl is for you okay bye you want to know what else has perfectly steamed rice and of course long slow strokes b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it thank you again to our friends like geicover sponsoring today's video they're helping me with my culinary journey around the united states and they want to help you too but with you know saving on your home

representation of what poke should be no not exactly because we did it in all the fancy things like i made fun of earlier how you make the fish is everything that makes poking quality of fish you choose how you cut it the sauce you put it in how long you marinate it that is what makes a true proper poke always starts with little geese see where i'm going with this so with all that said if you

Can we defeat this childhood favorite (is it even a childhood favorite?)...,2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, i've heard stories about this mostly horror stories so not only is this gonna be my first time trying it but it'll also be my last time because we're gonna beat [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay wait one second we have something very important coming out soon so i just want to present something does your mouth have a hard time masticating alone or in front of yourself and or family members well i can't fix that but i do have a cookbook that you can pre-order this book is not clinically proven or approved to do really anything it is just the greatest book of all time do not read this book if you suffer from a lack of taste are easily craving delicious meals and hate looking at informational content surrounded by beautiful images this book may contain knowledge technique papas kisses and a little bit of farting [Music] okay so today we're making hot pockets but better i don't know what led us down this road other than the volume of requests to do this yet another but better being done against my will thank you so much i guess for those people who've never had one or seen one it's basically like a lazy calzone from my understanding i have nothing else to say about these let's just get this over with and make this shall we wow we're back at the mecca the megalodon is that a word oh wow i hate being here anyway so i guess we'll go inside the red baron pizza wait what are we getting again so the classic ones so i've been told are pepperoni god this is just a depressing bag and then what was the other one ham and cheese oh we got the value pack got it what is that who looks like if you had no context and you just saw this you're like oh yum bon appetit so we've got the box let me just clarify i'm not like expecting a world class 3 michelin star product but this is what y'all are hype about you put these in the microwave i've never had a hot pocket [Music] i'm gonna discover it maybe i'll like it that's not an identifiable smell this smells worse than chuck e cheese pizza this has to smell worse wow they smell identical how is that possible okay so i guess you've got this little sleeve or the pocket good one oh cook then full this is a holster for it so how do i do this how is this not right what are you cooking in the magical heating machine 28 minutes in the oven okay we're microwaving this put it on a plate the magical heating machine there's a lot of waiting involved at this point you could have just uber eat something how is it that hot what's the point of the rest period look at this look at the steam erupting from this i'm getting more angry the longer this takes this is single-handedly the worst bite of food that we've had on this show to date that look nice vic you like that this one's a little better flavor wise but also has a nice undertone of burnt plastic thank you very much i have nothing else to say this has been a long one we're gonna do this hopefully better because i don't know what i'm gonna do if we don't all right folks i tried two different dough versions here first version was an ultra flaky pie crust which was dope and delicious but also significantly more annoying to handle when shaping because pie crust is so delicate and a slightly faster homemade route i think the second dough which was papa's puff pastry what's the winner here good job pal obviously you can either buy the puff pastry which if you do i recommend due for or of course you can use my recipe for homemade puff pastry and the link is in the description which look i get it it takes a lot of time to make and guess what it's better no surprises there alright okay now that we have that out of the way let's make our fillings and don't worry we'll jump back to the dough in just a moment first is our pepperoni pizza filling this is already an atrocity to italian cuisine so let's make something a little bit different first you'll start off with three ounces or 85 grams of guanchaela dice that into nice and evenly cut quarter inch cubes toss it into a medium saucepan optionally a light drizzle of extra virgin olive oil to help get it going set them to medium heat and let them cook until their fat is fully rendered and you get nice little brown crispy bits from there you'll add 5 cloves of garlic very thinly sliced let those cook in the guanciale fat stirring often until they are toasted in golden brown you know very underrated thing toasting garlic just do it more often do it for papa follow that up with fresh cracked black pepper let that toast a touch one tablespoon or five grams of finely chopped rosemary cook for 10 seconds then add in 1 6 ounce or 170 gram can of tomato paste stir that together fill up that same six ounce can to the brim with water add that to the pan stir together and let that simmer for about two minutes once that's done hit that with two teaspoons or eight grams of sugar and salt to taste finally add 3 tablespoons or 45 milliliters of extra virgin olive oil stir that together until emulsified and thoroughly combined and at this point your sauce is done and it should be awesome look it's far from a traditional tomato sauce i'm aware of that but it's absolutely maxed out with deep flavor de tumat now for the cheese you're just gonna mix one and a half cups or 190 grams of fresh grated low moisture mozzarella in three quarters of a cup or 73 grams of fresh grated grana padano or parmigiano cheese that was a good one right good pronunciation there look don't make me have the grating conversation by the way because uh you know just grate your cheese fresh so grate your cheese or don't and also don't receive a geese from last but not least is the pepperoni you'll need about 1 cup or 150 grams of pepperoni that's been sliced about a half an inch thick yes i like it and you know that and here i used a mix of pepperoni and salami the salami was sliced into coins then quartered and the pepperoni was sliced into coins and then halves thus creating a pepperoni textural wonderland for the people that does it for the pep pizza filling now for the him and cheese filling it's even easier start off with half a cup or 40 grams of prosciutto that's been diced roughly heat up a small saucepan with just barely enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom heat that over medium high until hot hot absolutely boiling add in your pro shoot and let that fry for 2-3 minutes stirring occasionally until they're brown and crisp turn in a paper towel and you've got that crispy prosciutto brother of course you'll also need one cup or 145 grams of ham that's diced in half inch cubes pretty straightforward there now for the cheese we're not just doing one two or even three cheeses we're doing five buddy you'll need one ball or 130 grams of samorza grated one cup or 126 grams of provolone grated one cup or 126 grams of smoked cheddar grated half a cup or 48 grams of parmigiano-reggiano and half a cup or 70 grams of raclette which hopefully also grated toss that together and that's your big for mojo little pants man okay assembly time first get yourself a single recipe batch of either my puff pastry or two bags of do four puff pastry roll that bad boy out until it's 12 inches by 10 inches and a quarter of an inch thick then first cut that into strips that are around three and a half inches wide and then into bars that are five inches long that should leave you with nice relatively evenly shaped bars it's okay if they're a little uneven because we're gonna trim them later anyway but yeah now to fill these get a piece of dough brush the edges with egg wash consisting of one egg beaten with one tablespoon or 14 milliliters of heavy cream now layering is very important first add a nice layer of sauce followed by a layer of cheese then your pepperoni be sure to cover this evenly but don't overfill it then another layer of sauce more cheese grab another piece of dough then carefully place it on top and gently butt firmly seal the edges completely please they're not sealed guess what's going to happen let's get them open and in this case you won't be excited about it then using either a knife or fluted ravioli cutter trim the edges so they're clean and straight then just repeat that with the rest of your desired amount of peppy hot boys next ham and cheese filling of course brush the border around your piece of dough then cheese then ham followed by your crispy prosciutto and you guessed it more cheese top that with another layer of dough seal the edges trim them beautifully and lovingly place all those bad boys on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper as you go giving them at least an inch of space apart and cover that brother with plastic wrap and let it chill in the fridge for 15 minutes also don't skip this because it's essential for puff pastry to get a little chilly time in the fridge once you're ready to bake and your oven is preheated to 375 fahrenheit brush the tops of pastries with that same egg wash optionally poke a couple holes into the top of the pastry using a cake tester to allow a little air to escape and keep them from exploding then finally pop them into the oven for 15 to 20 minutes now wait a day a minute while those are baking if you really want to make this extra special then i'd recommend making a quick herb butter by getting the cutest little saucepan ever adding a third cup for 78 grams of unsalted butter two sprigs of rosemary cut in half and lightly bruised three to four garlic cloves crushed and left in their skin pop that onto the stove sit to medium low and let that heat until fully melted then just leave that on the heat for about five minutes or until infused with flavor and beautifully fragrant pull it off the stove and set to the side now once your pastries are done and come out as a beautiful golden brown hit them with a nice brushing of herb butter and a beautiful sprinkle of flaky salt now these aren't just hot pockets these are a crafted pastry full of culinary passion and wonder now we need to put them next to the coveted hot pocket and see how we did so let us taste test so visually these are a little shorter but it's not always about length sometimes it's also about girth i mean it sounds like i'm flicking a soccer ball now what do these sound like let's give that a sound test you already know they'd be flaking oh yeah i'm gonna take my clothes off right now the entire team's like um hang on we have to leave this is like instantaneously better i have nothing else to say about that it's buttery rich intense flavor this is almost reminiscent to like a really good ham and cheese oh lord have mercy have mercy on my soul don't beat me up yet back to earth first impressions are everything and my first impression of these was horrible and so was the last impression of it because i will not be having them again we've won this episode but we cannot decide that until we have our taste tester of the day kendrick please mama so pep numero uno oh you wanna i did where are you going i'm happy okay okay we have to be serious for a second everybody remember what the abcs are like this is actually kind of hard to chew the joke's on you that was my poop all right more poop please here's number two number two mmm mmm oh that's so good number one the first one or the second one uh the second one's so much better this is not a win until we get a two out of two abc wow don't bite my thingy number two ham and cheese tastes like cheese whiz i can swoop wow man i've never hated hot pockets as much as i do right i thought you said you liked them i did then i just had these god the original hot pockets are so much worse in comparison they're just like dry there's not a lot of flavor tastes like cheese whiz yours on the other hand that garlic and herb butter like leaves ahead it's incredibly savory it was like the perfect amount of salt it felt good to have in my mouth that's still in one piece we're the winners yet again but better we're just getting bag after bat i'm sorry finalization we already know we've won this episode about better taste the original and you suddenly realize wait a minute they're not really trying that hard why have i accepted this in the first place to actually be good when it could be so much better with a little bit of effort nice little better buddy oh my pants just now you want to know what else has big crisp puff pastry stuffed with papa's meat b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we had our hot pockets but better many does to choose from right a b should it be pie should it be flaky puff pastry i think the choice is kind of yours but at the end of the day the puff pastry was the in my opinion the absolute winner of the entire scenario the flakiness the tenderness the dough held together nicely when i was shaping it that is the route you want to go but you know what you make pie crust if you want to you don't want to use puff pastry how many calories uh actually they're both pretty high calorie aren't they so yeah just don't make this if you're on a diet how about that okay i'm on a diet i shouldn't be making it at all why am i talking about this okay so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a

Ways),https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JbqeiCi_aJY/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBB9jMeDMpERn6Ulislu93JpVqBFw,JbqeiCi_aJY,"12 minutes, 43 seconds","These are the pork belly buns that have swept the world...gua bao homemade bao dough, two pork belly methods including a special one thanks to Traeger Grills, and a traditional method...only...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, i think most people can agree that iconic foods like burgers pizzas sandwiches are simply things that we cannot know a world without them and i think that these fall in that category [Music] okay so we're making bao again we've made them before but this one is very different i'm talking about the kind of taking the internet by storm and the ones that are shaped kind of like a little chuckle typically filled with pork belly or many other happy gizkis things and if we're gonna do this we're definitely doing multiple fillings a traditional one for sure but what are the other options my mind immediately shouted at me like it always does to smoke something not like a schmoker pancake but more of a smoker bruv and look i've always been a traditionalist smoker by tending to the fire and this and that so that's where today's sponsor traeger comes in after using their smokers for about a year i've realized that they're a true smoking tool and since all of you constantly complain oh it's too hard to smoke then the trigger 885 ironwood is your savior trying to help you here precision smoking minimal active effort i mean it's basically the sous-vide of smokers take it or leave it bud so click the link in the description to learn more about how the iron one 885 can smoke grill and do all them little things precisely with little effort so with all that said let's make this shall we all right we're making two different pork belly buns here a more traditional super tender red cooked pork with crushed peanuts and something with a nod to that tradition but smoked kind of like a beautiful brisket and sliced to utter succulent beauty now before we even look at how to make our pork let's make our baoban dough if you don't make the dough then papa will give you seal of approval it's super easy so stay with me and stay calm start with one and a half cups or 360 milliliters of whole milk it's around 95 fahrenheit to that whisk in 2 teaspoons or 7 grams of instant yeast and 3 tablespoons or 40 grams of granulated sugar let that sit for 5 minutes then in a large bowl add 4 cups or 600 grams of all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons or 6 grams of baking powder and half a teaspoon or 3 grams of salt and of course give that some whiskey then add your milky yeasty boy to the flour mixture and mix by hand until you get a rough dough and just knead that little baby man for about three minutes or until it begins to turn smooth cover that with plastic wrap and let that rest for 10 minutes then pull it back out and knead it one more time for another minute or so until very smooth and extensible now look don't get too carried away with kneading or you'll end up with a tough dough and a disappointed now gently roll that into a ball place in a greased bowl cover with plastic wrap and let it rise for one hour at room temperature whilst that's rising cut out 20 pieces of parchment paper in the shape of a square about the size of your palm this will be for your finished bow and once your dough is done in lump punch out all the air and cut that into 15 to 20 pieces that are around 50 to 70 grams each from those pieces form them into light balls cover them with greased plastic wrap or a damp towel to keep them from drying out then to shape them lightly flour your work surface and your dough and roll into a novel that's about two and a quarter inch by four and a half inches and about a quarter inch thick flip it over so the underside is now facing up give it a few more rolls on this side if it didn't quite get to the desired length then brush that side lightly with vegetable oil fold it over itself to get a taco shape and place it on a piece of parchment repeat that process with all of your little bow babies place them on a baking sheet and cover with greased plastic wrap and in my opinion at this point they rise very fast so if you're not gonna steam and eat them right away i recommend immediately refrigerating until you're ready to use them which you can do up to four to five hours beforehand otherwise proof them for 15 to 20 minutes at room temp or until slightly puffy now to steam these bad boys prepare a steamer basket set up over a pot of gently simmering water transfer your bell buns on your parchment into the steamer put as many as you can fit in one layer only cover and let them steam over medium blowish heat for 10 minutes listen you need to understand that while these are cooking don't remove the lid to check and oh how are they doing because if you do you'll release an angry gremlin that will shame you for ruining your bowel for all of eternity which at that point feel like you probably would deserve now once those 10 minutes are up cut the heat but leave the lid on and let them sit in the steamer basket covered for four more minutes then remove your lid and reveal the big plump boys and place them on a baking sheet or a plate cover them with plastic wrap to keep them from going dry then leave them in a slightly warmed oven while you make the rest so obviously this can be done while you make your filling or after you make it up to you so that brings us to well the fillings first up is mister traditional start off with one and a half pounds of skin on pork belly cut that into three quarter inch thick strips that are about two and a half to three inches long then begin heating a large dush oven over medium high add just enough vegetable oil to cook the bottom of the pan season your pork to taste with salt and sear in a single layer for two to three minutes flip and sear the other side for another two minutes so you get a beautiful browning [Music] and repeat with the rest of your pork belly once all your pork has been seared and is out of the pan deglaze your pan with two cups of filtered water then add three tablespoons of dark soy sauce one tablespoon of regular soy sauce three tablespoons of shaoxing wine two star nice and about one and a half tablespoons of rock sugar which to be fair is usually only going to be found at a local asian market or specialty market so you can totally sub regular sugar but it won't get as nice of a gloss as with rock just traditional pop of things now bring the tube boil over medium high then reduce the temp to low and a simmer then add all of your pork back cover with a towel or parchment paper then a lid this really helps get a nice seal for the perfect bracing environment and let that simmer for 45 minutes to an hour turning the pieces every so often to get them coated in the sauce now please be careful with the towel make sure it doesn't touch the flame for obvious reasons okay be safe then once your little from the pork man is tender and glazed nicely remove it from your pot and if that liquid isn't quite thickened enough crank up the heat and reduce that liquid stirring occasionally until it's thickened and glossy then pour that over your pork and gently toss to coat cover that with foil and place in a warm oven until ready to use for that magical peanut topping that those of us know and love and potentially have dreams of you'll simply need one cup of roasted peanuts place them on a plate and in the freezer for 10 minutes then into a food processor to beat the sheet out of them by pulsing repeatedly until you get a semi-coarse powder like this mix that together in a bowl with a small pinch of fine sea salt a quarter cup of powdered sugar until thoroughly combined crush up any dried bits of powdered sugar and that is your peanut topping last but not least is our carrot daikon salad you can use fresh or pickled carrot in this case i'm using some of my pickled julienne carrot from my poke video but to do that get a medium sized bowl and of course you're going to need a big boy daikon chop that and julienne yourself about one cup worth of daikon full by half a cup of julienne fresh or pickled carrot season that to taste with salt and a small splash of yuzu or lemon juice toss together to coat and that's your salad okay assembly time get your bow bun fill it with your carrot daikon salad then a 50 50 mix of fresh thai basil leaves in cilantro leaves top with your beautifully braised pork belly which by the way you can totally remove the skin at this point prior to serving should you not desire that follow that up with your lovely peanut topping and that is your beautiful bun now hold on to your cowboy hat brother before we crack into this here bun we gotta make our competition it's time for mr smokey maybe we'll call it our sichuan smoked pork belly sounds good since we're gonna use our trigger the ease of smoke goes and i mean it really does you add your hickory pellets to your auger close it turn it on and set it to smoke at 275 fahrenheit and that's actually it you're ready to go to prep your belly let's first make our spice mix get a quarter cup or four pucks of palm sugar place those in a bag and crush by smacking that thang i've been a bad little pum sugi teach it a little lesson shooky then place it into a blender and make sure that that palm sugar is pretty well crushed or it will obliterate your blender's blades along with four star nice two teaspoons of sichuan peppercorns two teaspoons of fennel seeds and blend that until you get a fine powder optionally you can add some dashi mushroom soup powder if you're a bad boy like me blend that in as well then pour that into a medium sized bowl along with two teaspoons of ground cinnamon and two and a half tablespoons of kosher salt whisk that together until thoroughly combined and that's your spice mix next you'll need a four pound piece of this time skinless pork belly you can always cut the skin off yourself and make chicharrones if you're a real g but that's up to you cut your pork belly into rectangular pieces that are about two and a half to three inches wide so that when you slice this it'll be a similar length to fit your bow properly you may have some meat stragglers when you slice it and that's no problem brother now season your meat generously with your spice mixture and you'll likely end up using all of it rub that seasoning in place it on a wire rack and then place it into your preheated trigger or smoker close the lid and let that bad boy smoke for three to four hours until tender but still sliceable now while that's smoking since we sort of have a good old barbecue going let's make a sambal barbecue sauce to a medium sized soft spot add half a cup of white distilled vinegar a third cup of dark soy sauce a half cup of granulated sugar a quarter cup of sambal olek a quarter cup of gochujang and three tablespoons of wildflower honey mix all that together set the heat to medium high and once it comes to a boil reduce the heat to low and simmer it and reduce for two minutes separately whisk together two tablespoons of corn starch and two tablespoons of water to make well cornstarch slurry add half your slurry to your sauce and check for consistency you want this bad boy to have a similar consistency to hoisin sauce add more slurry as needed and well that's it give it a little taste and go into heaven because now you have a beautiful luxurious barbecue sauce ready to coat a plump succulent slice of pork belly okay so once your pork belly is done remove it from the smoker and let it rest for 15 minutes then using a serrated knife slice that beautiful hunk of oh she juice in see you can already tell just from these porky puddles that this is going to be a beautiful time anyway slice it into half inch thick pieces i like it thick but you can also go thinner if you like then once your pork is sliced open up a nice warm bow bun add your juicy pork belly give it a generous coat in your sambal barbecue top with some fried shallots if you can even find them apparently there's a shortage in houston which is just dope i cry every time hit that with a nice sack of fresh and very thinly sliced green onion and that already looks like an iconic bow bun oh and would you look at that i made it through this entire video without making a single bow pun so you can thank me for that now after you've thanked me we can then begin the taste test wow look at that we have [Music] we have mr traditional oh little cute little oh spilling peanut everywhere and then we have something a little different the idea was combining brisket and well this we had the smoker the trigger killed it it's got the smoke but first let's try to taste see that made me strip over my words i took a big bite it's just what you would expect from a proper gu about the delicious pork it's succulent tender rich fatty you can taste the starnis you can taste all the different spices and it reduces down to this beautiful glaze it's what you want now this on the other hand it's a barbecue sauce almost it's juicy it's lucy this isn't about better it's not about which one is better but this one is better only because it has a bit of a more refined taste and yet it hasn't lost what i think makes a traditional bout with that said you want something more traditionally you go this route but if you want something extra special that has the flavor it has the smoke it has something just a little bit more than what you thought you were gonna get gosh don't get that trigger one you want to know what else is full of smoky pork belly dreams squirting with meat juices b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it thank you again to trigger for sponsoring today's video we appreciate them and look being completely honest with you i love finding ways to enhance the meals that i make at home while also making things more efficient it's a big thing for me and the trigger ironwood 85 makes wood-fired food deliciously easy to obtain so whether you're a traditionalist smoker or a beginner and you just want a perfectly smoked meal click the link in the description to learn more about traeger now let's talk about this go about there's something special about having these beautiful cloud-like pillows cradling a tender piece of pork belly it's an amazing experience and people spend lots and lots of money to go do it the realities can be made at home very very easily time doesn't equal difficulty it just means you have to be patient for once in your life take a sunday hang out with the homies crack open a cold one drink it white claw whatever the hell you drink i don't care it doesn't matter just give it a shot you won't regret it now with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see

Additional...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, you're sitting at home you're watching a movie you order some sweet and sour chicken you eat it and then wait a minute it's this much per person brother when it could be this much that is but cheaper [Music] [Applause] hello buy my book [Applause] okay so sweet and sour chicken many of us in america know what it is i'm pretty sure it's more of an americanized dish so we're not going to go too deep into the traditions of what it is but it's exactly what it sounds like nobody really knows what the sauce exactly is it's like corn syrup and white distilled vinegar and that's it i'm not really sure so we're gonna do our best to recreate that flavor and you already know it's gonna be better so don't even this isn't about better but just don't don't go there okay the price point of the average sweet and sour chicken isn't necessarily considered expensive but why couldn't it be cheaper why couldn't it be less expensive that's what this show is all about so without this sun is going to piss me off you go you go so with all that said let's make this shall we right out so this is a shockingly fast to make recipe and it's all done in a single wok so first you're gonna start by cutting one red bell pepper into one inch pieces one green bell pepper into one inch pieces and half a red onion also into one inch pieces see how there's kind of a pattern here put all that into a bowl then toss together separately you'll need about one cup or 220 grams of medium diced pineapple and of course papa uses the pineapple it's easy cut off the top the bottom then shave off the skin by cutting round the fruit while trying to maintain the flesh as much as possible then cut it in half then into quarters slice out the core and well now all you gotta do is just dice that brother up okay we have our veg and fruit so now and only now can we use our board for the chicken see there's a method here buddy do your veg and then your chicken you want to cut your nasty ass raw chicken on a board then get your fresh pineapple all up in there look just not right okay total bra moment please stop immediately now get yourself one pound or 450 grams of boneless and skinless chicken thighs cut them into one inch pieces and as usual please keep them even toss those into a bowl and season generously with kosher salt then just place those in the fridge to cure for at least one hour but ideally overnight you'll notice i do this often with lots of chicken and it's because it gives the salt time to really penetrate the meat and don't tell me that you don't like that word okay first it was moist now it's penetrate get over yourself now while that's curing we can get our sweet and sour sauce prepared in a bowl add two tablespoons or 30 grams of granulated sugar three and a half tablespoons or 52 grams of ketchup half a cup or 120 milliliters of pineapple juice 3 tablespoons or 45 milliliters of rice wine vinegar whistle together half a cup or 120 milliliters of hot water and season a taste with salt you know whisk that in as well duh in a separate bowl waste together 2 tablespoons or 15 grams of corn starch and 2 tablespoons or 28 grams of water to get a nice slurry now place those two to the side for our chicken we're gonna need a simple tempura esque batter that's emphasis on esque in a medium sized bowl add three quarters of a cup or 112 grams of all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons are 28 grams of corn starch 1 teaspoon or 5 grams of baking powder half a teaspoon or 3 grams of baking soda give that some [Music] till combined then using a fjork mix in three quarters of a cup or 180 milliliters of ice water to get a thick bowl batter and finally mix in one tablespoon or 14 grams of vegetable oil and that is your chicken now fill a separate bowl with just plain all-purpose flour for dusting only like a half cup or so i usually eyeball it you're not gonna need much just don't overdo it now get yourself a large walk yes of course you can do this in a pot but you'll be completely missing out on the walk hey which both papa and uncle roger will be watching in complete disappointment anyway fill that bad boy about half the way up with vegetable oil heat that over high heat and once it reaches 350 degrees fahrenheit toss a handful of your chicken into the plain flour shake off the excess then dunk your pieces into the batter shake off that excess and carefully place into your hot oil you'll likely have to do this in two to three batches depending on the size of your wok but definitely do not overcrowd that thing now just let those bad boys fry turning them occasionally for about four to five minutes or until they reach a beautiful golden brown and the inside is cooked to at least 165 fahrenheit then using a spider fish your little chicken men out of the oil and treat on a wire rack or paper towels then all you gotta do is repeat with the rest of your chicken being careful not to splash yourself with oil because you're likely excited for the end product but splashing yourself can result in an injury obviously now once all of your chicken is fried pour out all of your oil but about 3 tablespoons then heat your pan over high heat and once it's screaming hot add in your onion and pepper mix and begin stir frying really give it that nice toss and turn and twist the flick of the wrist and of course the wok hay i mean look at that thang flying up that is what you want now once your veg is starting to soften and pick up some light color about two to three minutes add in your pineapple stir fry for 30 seconds then add in your sweet and sour sauce toss together and let that simmer and reduce for about 1 minute then add in half of your cornstarch slurry assess its absolute thickness and add more slurry if it needs to be thicker once it has the correct consistency add your chicken back in turn off the heat and toss together until evenly distributed and the chicken is completely coated in the sauce you know i don't understand how you can ever get chicken that's not properly coated it's it's not okay it's lazy it's sad please take the time lastly once that's coated add in three cloves of very finely minced fresh garlic no not the pre-peeled or the pre-crushed garlic please stop doing that dust that to evenly distribute the garlic and serve immediately over rice and get ready to go to confession station because lord have mercy on my behind for i am about to blush now let us taste test wow look at this all this for this price right here per serving this is a little bit of an extra large serving sweet and sour chicken which is already commonly inexpensive we've made it much cheaper at home what josh you can make sweet and sour chicken at home that's impossible and it's technically a one pot meal there you go let's get a sound test on this oh yeah that is what i would call big mommy oh there goes the sun that's how good it was you guys know it's good when the sun randomly goes away thanks houston what should a classic sweet sour have it should be sweet and it should be sour all right assuming that you fry this properly the chicken should still be a little bit crisp but also have that nice chew to it the crust is sort of combined with the sauce to become a caramelized skin it's got the umami it's got richness to it the point that i want to make is that you can make your very own takeaway at home for it even cheaper than your favorite chinese restaurants don't do that okay people yelled at me about that i'm not doing it you want to know what else has glistening glazed thighs for all of us to see b-roll okay what do i usually say i can't remember what i usually say all alright guys so that is it oh yeah vikram come do this outro all right guys so that is it we made our sweet and sour chicken it was sweet it was sour so let's get josh in here thank you vikram for pulling that one together because apparently i can't talk today we made the sweet and sour chicken it came out beautifully it had the nes it had the correct texture of the sauce gooey and yet sweet and yet umami classic flavors of a sweet and sour but elevated for a beautiful price of this per serving per person whatever the hell you want to call it if you are cooking from home it is always going to be less expensive that is just the plain fact of cooking if you want to waste your money and go eat out at a crappy restaurant then 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 11 12 times the price and that's your prerogative we're just trying to make a little bit of value

Belgian),https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s8yK8gUwomM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBcdNrH8KVqGnpN-UJSBTIdv66o2A,s8yK8gUwomM,"10 minutes, 28 seconds","Yeah, waffles are good but most of the time, homemade just doesn't hit right. We're going to make a major correction to that by making mochi waffles, the classic Belgian liege waffle, and even...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, so many of us think that there's only one kind of waffle boy you could not be more wrong and today i'd like to introduce you to the magical world of the perfect waffle [Music] okay so today we're making waffles but not just any waffles we're making the three best versions of waffles that i can think of we have the traditional sort of quick little baking soda you throw it in the pan and it's done then we're gonna make a classic belgian liege waffle the one that you rise okay a lot of people don't make this because they're like oh my gosh i have to put the yeast wafer to rise that silver no listen sharon i'm joking any sharon's out there papa keys all right my point is that you just have to wait for like 40 minutes to do that it's not that bad and then the third would be a classic mochi waffle i wanted to originally do these mochi ones with ube but i couldn't find anything in the amount of time because they're really freaking hard to find but i will do another guide that's further in depth about mochi later but despite all that we're gonna make these three waffles and then we're gonna decide if there is a perfect waffle of all time so with all that said let's make this shall we okay folks although i can enjoy shrek as much as the next guy we won't be making any donkey references in this video instead we'll be making mr easy peasy quick waffles classic belgian liege waffles and last but certainly far from least mochi waffles with whipped cream and bananas foster topping we're getting real nothing with that one let's start things off with the easy more americanized waffles stir with a medium sized bowl and add two cups of all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons of granulated sugar 1 teaspoon of fine sea salt 1 tablespoon of baking powder and give this some [Music] to that you'll add half a cup of buttermilk which looks alarmingly thicker than normal one cup of whole milk one teaspoon of vanilla extract two eggs plus an additional egg yolk start whisking that together then once it starts to form a batter slowly stream in three quarters of a cup of gently melted unsalted butter then once all that is incorporated in homogeneous then you have your lovely batter that's really it now all you have to do is preheat your favorite waffle iron spray with cooking oil add enough batter to fill out the iron about three quarters of the way around gently close it completely and let it cook flipping almost immediately after you've closed assuming it can flip and allow it to cook until it reaches a beautiful golden brown and is cooked through which could be anywhere between two to five minutes depending on the size of the waffle iron now pop that bad boy out of your iron and that's a gosh darn bead of waffle if i'm being honest to serve this you'll give it that good classic pat of butter a generous glug of pure unadulterated high quality maple syrup something about these syrup drizzles activates a carnal desire part of the human brain and my body is ready for it but before we do the taste test let's move on to our belgian liege waffles this is a classy yeast risen batter which gives it its undeniably special flavor so first start with one cup of whole milk heat it to around 95 fahrenheit then whisk in two teaspoons of instant yeast and let that sit for five minutes at room temp in a separate medium sized bowl add a quarter cup of granulated sugar one and a half teaspoons of fine sea salt two room temp eggs one egg yolk start whisking that together then once that's combined stream in six tablespoons of unsalted butter that's been gently melted emphasis on gently don't get all excited on me and get your butter piping hot unless you plan on making scrambled eggs in the bowl be sweet to the butter gently coerce it into a liquid state by singing it hymns from an ancient self-help book now in a large bowl add three and a half cups of all-purpose flour to that you'll make a small well add your yeasty milkman your egg mixture then start mixing that by hand until a shaggy dough forms then begin kneading that for about five minutes giving it a few slap and folds here and there until you get a smooth dough yes it will be sticky don't worry now lightly shape that into a ball place in a greased bowl cover with plastic wrap of course and give it a classic personality then just let that rise at room temp for one hour or until doubled and juicy then just punch all the gas out of your dough and add in one and a half cups of pearl sugar to your dough knead that all in until it's evenly dispersed throughout the entire dough and has been completely absorbed there shouldn't be any remaining in the bowl from there you'll divide your dough into six to twelve pieces again depending on the size of your waffle maker cover them with a greased plastic wrap and let them rest for 10 minutes sure the dough looks like it's been rolled in crumpled styrofoam but i can assure you that it's gonna be very jummy not the siren foam part don't do that now the last bit is as easy as the other heat up your waffle iron spray it with cooking spray add in enough of your dough to fill out about three quarters of the iron close it firmly to disperse and let it cook for about 20 seconds give it a flip if you can and let it cook until a beautiful deep caramelized golden brown then just carefully remove it from the iron try not to burn yourself and serve that topped with the sorted berries of your choice here i have strawberry blackberry and blueberries although i'm not really a huge fan of blueberries sorry to the blueberry homies optionally hit that with a light dusting of powdered sugar and that is your beautiful liege waffle now we have our last final and arguably most exciting one of the day the mochi waffle in a large bowl add one egg whisk that together until you guessed it now while constantly whisking stream in three quarters of a cup of whole milk two tablespoons of gently melted unsalted butter see that's gently again all right we're not slapping the butter around once combined half a teaspoon of fine sea salt one and a half teaspoons of baking powder and three quarters of a cup of granulated sugar once combined and creamy add in one and a half cups of mochiko sweet rice flour link in the description for that whisk all that together until you get a thick almost paste-like batter then pour that into a piping bag and set that to the side while we make our banana for the people in a large pan add a quarter cup of unsalted butter heat it over a medium heat until it's melted then add three quarters of a cup of light brown sugar stir that to disperse and as soon as it melts and begins to simmer add in three bananas that have been sliced into half-inch thick coins try to keep them evenly separated and let those cook in the simmering buttery sugar mixture for about one minute or till caramelized on the underside give them all a little flip and yes it's tedious to flip each and every one but we like it to be precise here okay it's almost like you're giving each little banana slice a kiss by flipping them individually now hit that with a small pinch of salt a light sprinkling of ground cinnamon two teaspoons of vanilla extract and finally a quarter cup of good quality rum pump the heat up to medium high and as soon as that liquid comes to a simmer ignite the steam using a kitchen torch and do me a solid and stand back if you want to keep your eyebrows now once that ignites give it a good old classic flamio hutman and constantly shake the pan to stir and emulsify the sauce as it forms into a beautiful glaze coating each banana lovingly just as we flipped each lovingly as soon as the flame goes out cut off your heat and that right there is your rum caramel banana foster now back to our waffles you've heard this spiel before heat your waffle iron fill with your batter which by the way if you want more than four of these mochi waffles you'll likely need to double this recipe just a heads up anyway close your waffle iron and allow that to cook until a beautiful almost cloud-esque looking waffle emerges from your waffle iron something about this waffle looks almost cartoonish and special at the same time but to take it even further we'll add a fat quinel of a chantilly cream which is literally just a slightly sweetened whipped cream optional but very gemmy a generous helping of your bananas foster followed by a drizzle of the rum salted caramel and lord have mercy the double caramel whipped cream drip is gonna have me singing to the moon about my sorrows for i am about to bush now let's find out if there's a true king of waffles here and begin the taste test wow look at these vapors hell yeah we have three different kinds we have belgian we have did it's kind of americanized this version it's fast and last but not least is the moji i wanted to originally do this with ube but we didn't get the ube here in time so boo bae let's start with mr traditional okay it's like an upscale adult egg waffle is there a problem with that hell no there's a certain beauty to that and it's easy and fast to make what's wrong with that the liege waffle don't forget to buy my book by the way the link is in the description pre-order today all right the pre-orders are very helpful you're just gonna let that happen in vain wow look at all the content in that so the outside's crisp but the inside is ch i like a chewy waffle it's almost kind of brioche like i would say it looks like a bread which is nice oh damn this is good that's good bro cody i'm sorry you didn't deserve this at all shout out to kelsey too it's essentially like ultra chewy crispy caramelized on the outside brioche version of a waffle that's what i'm detecting from this do i need to say more because if i do you just shouldn't be here sorry last but not least is this mochi waffle now there's a whole lot of other things about this that look amazing which is the bananas foster on top the whipped cream come on texture this is insane oh wow this is the best by far easily i didn't even get any of the toppings just texturally as a waffle this is what every single waffle should be period end of story yes caramelized to perfection it's a little crunchy the whipped cream provides richness like we always do all right vic i'm going to give you the perfect bite can you fit this in your mouth yeah yeah crazy like i'm actually blown away by how good this is it gets better as you go like you start and you're like oh this is really good and then it sticks in your mouth and the banana foster comes in the whipped cream comes in all coming together one good best one best waffle i've ever had it's not always about what's better because this isn't a better first off my personal preference leans towards the mochi if you've never made this before this is just as easy to make as this just go get some freaking rice flour put it together and you might just have one of the best waffle experiences your gosh darn life go on and get you want to know what else has papa's syrupy drizzle stuck in your mind all day long b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our three waffles and you know what a beautiful story developed isn't that nice and that story is that well really any waffle is delicious it all comes down to the eating experience that you want despite all these different versions and ways that you can make it i personally felt the mochi one was the most interesting in texture and flavor and it's still retained the beauty of what a waffle is i would eat that more than the other waffles that were there and it doesn't require that much more prep really actually any at all though whatever and i'm not just talking about the bananas on top i get the bananas real good the li age waffles classic on the outside and then of course there's our sort of more americanized quick version that's kind of like a giant eggo which hey can't complain about that either the choice is always yours don't overthink it now with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] [Music] you

This time with the coveted homemade chicken sandwich, with homemade buns. 

Get My Cookbook: http://bit.ly/JWCookbookAmazon...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, [Music] so as many of you know i recently announced that my cookbook is on pre-order in three hours it went number one across the globe including the us in canada so that's pretty cool but you want to know what's a whole lot cooler brother reordering my book now get on over the link in the description and pre-order that book chick-fil-a popeyes we've been through the chicken sandwich world and we haven't lost yet and we're definitely not going to lose to kfc [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today we're making the kfc chicken sandwich what does that mean what's the difference between this chicken sandwich and any other chicken sandwich we've been on the channel before right josh you're gonna just do the same bun same front no okay it's about technique it's about spices chosen and it's little changes that we make to the dough that make it what it should be we're gonna be making everything from scratch of course the buns of course the chicken and our own beautiful msg garlic aioli and if that doesn't get your gears grinding and rolling i don't know what the heck will so with all that said let's make this shall we wow it's the taco colonel the local kfc backslash taco bell this guy's serenading someone hey yo he's serenading his lover let me just bring back love two classic uh kfc chicken sandwiches the guy in front of us ordered his food and he i guess he got tired of waiting so he's like that's it i'm getting i'm going home clarissa shut the up and then he just drove off so i'm wondering if we're gonna get his order too thank you we're good all right so we're gonna go eat it i guess okay so we've got uh i like this design a lot better just compared to all the other ones that we've seen throughout the days and weeks and months and year year the one with mcdonald's trying to be artsy fartsy look and learn bud yeah that's a little weird though i don't want to look at that why are you looking at me like that i have one thing to say before i even eat this this is the best looking chicken sandwich we have had on butt better easily this actually looks like the photo good amount of pickles i thought there was mayo did you forget something pickles all in the center i thought the pickles were on the bottom though excuse me sir that's the top i'm not saying that that makes the sandwich worse but i do say that that's false advertising oh my god that is dry flavor-wise not bad salt levels are perfect i will say that kfc always nails salt and that's a big one for me but the other thing that they nail is leaving the chicken in the fryer so long you can texturally tell each and every fiber from top to bottom i'm running out of breath because i'm using the majority of my energy to moisturize my mouth from how dry the chicken is uh buns are good i actually like them one of the better buns i like it they say it's brioche it's not just does a heads up can we do better than this salt level seasoning level yes texturally definitely begin all right we all know my buns at this point so i'm not gonna put you through that process again so if you want the recipe or you still haven't seen it somehow i don't know how it's possible link is in the description all you need to know is that i tweaked it slightly i added a little extra water and an extra like two tablespoons of sugar to give it some sweetness to the dough kind of like how mass manufactured breads have extra sugar in them because they have lower quality ingredients and they need actual flavor so they do that but you see we already have flavors so that plus sugar is more flavor anyway once your buns are shaped brushed with egg wash baked until beautifully browned and finally brushed with butter we can then jump into making our sandwich components first let's marinate our cook it's french fruit chicken and sounds funny in a large bowl add one tablespoon of smoked paprika one and a half teaspoons of yes kfc uses it one tablespoon of kosher salt one tablespoon of garlic powder and one tablespoon of ground white pepper give it a little whisk and then whisk in two cups of buttermilk once all that's combined you have your chicken's little bag then to that you'll add two pounds of chicken thighs now look you can use boneless skinless chicken thighs it's definitely the easiest route and it's still delicious but if you really want your chicken to have that juicy juicy squirt squirt i would recommend getting the bone in and skin on chicken thighs removing the bone yourself and yes oh it's a little extra work but all you need is a sharp knife to run it down the fat line that runs over the bone of the thigh whittle your knife under there scrape the meat off the bone and it should come right out it's genuinely one of the most self-explanatory bones to remove in a piece of meat but hey that's just papa's preference but also papa's preference usually results in something more flavorful and texturally exciting anyway toss your chicken to coat make sure it's covered in the marinade and at this point you can use it right away but i recommend letting it sit in the fridge for at least one hour or up to overnight next pickles not just any pickles for this sandwich i'm gonna be using bread and butter as opposed to dill it just felt right oh josh but they use dill pickles i don't care to make your get yourself two large seedless english cucumbers slice them into half inch rounds keep those rounds as even as you can as usual toss into a half gallon jar along with half a sweet onion that's been thinly sliced give it a little shake and a toss then to a medium sized pot add three quarters of a cup of granulated sugar three tablespoons of kosher salt one and a half cups of white distilled vinegar half a cup of water one teaspoon of celery seeds and two tablespoons of mustard seeds set that over medium high and as soon as that sugar dissolves and it comes to a boil take it off the heat whisk in one teaspoon of turmeric powder and then immediately pour that hot liquid over your cux and you'll place a medium sized plastic bag filled with water into your jar to keep everything submerged and let that sit at room temp until it cools down to wild room temp and from there you'll have lovely bread and butter pickles next mayo kfc uses just well regular mail nothing special and everyone's giving this an unnecessary amount of clout for it why instead we're gonna make a magic mushroom garlic mayo first get yourself four to five cloves of garlic crush them with the flats out of your knife then begin slicing them very thin bring that together and start rough chopping look we're gonna be doing this for a little bit so get a generous pinch of kosher salt on that that'll help break it all down constantly give that a nice rolling chop occasionally bringing it back together and pressing and smearing with the flat side of your knife and rinse and repeat until you get a beautiful garlic paste and before you say anything don't even think about putting this into a blender or a food processor or anything like that do it by hand this process helps create a very special mellowed and get forward garlicky flavor now from there add two egg yolks to a medium sized bowl followed by your garlic paste one generous tablespoon of dijon one tablespoon of water two tablespoons of lemon juice a small pinch of salt and a generous pinch of instantized umami mushroom powder you can get this stuff at a lot of local asian markets and it's literally just mushroom soup powder granules that instantly dissolve kind of like mushroom powder mixed with msg essentially it's good and it's optional anyway whisk all that together until homogeneous then while constantly whisking slowly streaming one and a quarter cup of vegetable oil evenly and slowly keep that poor gentle and only increase the speed of your pore after it gets a strong emulsion once all of your oil has been added you should be left with a beautifully glossy and creamy thick mayo now comes the king to our sandwich the chicken now hold your horses brother you think we can make this chicken without a classic lemon herbs and spices don't you worry cowboy papas gotcha for that get yourself a large bowl and add two and a half cups of all-purpose flour then in a blender add one tablespoon of mustard seeds one tablespoon of black peppercorns and two teaspoons of celery seeds pop on the lid blend at high speed and enjoy a nice little almost ghost-like dance from the spices inside until very fine and powder like add that to your flour and to that you're gonna add one tablespoon of garlic powder one tablespoon of ground ginger two teaspoons of dried oregano lightly crushed with your hands two teaspoons of dried thyme also crushed with your hands three tablespoons of ground white pepper three and a half tablespoons of paprika one and a quarter tablespoon of msg two and a half tablespoons of kosher salt and bing bang boom we got 11 herbs and spices including the salt now whisk all that together until thoroughly combined and you have your flour dredge now we're ready to fry the chicken get your station set up get a pot of oil set to 350 fahrenheit then to your flour dredge drizzle in about two tablespoons of your marinade from your chicken toss together vigorously to get tiny little balls disperse through it it'll help generate an extra wispy flaky what i like to call crusty crusty a crust that is so crunchy and perfect that any and all desires for another food to be eaten that day are null and void now take a piece of chicken place it in the flour and coat both sides aggressively pressing to adhere the flour to the chicken and again no blank spots on your chicken i say it every time and i keep seeing people doing it please stop once coated place that in a baking sheet and repeat with the rest of your chicken once you're done depending on the size of your pot fry 2-3 pieces of chicken at a time by gently lowering into the oil and letting it fry for four to six minutes or until a beautiful deep golden brown piece of chicken emerges place it on a wire rack to cool and repeat with the rest of your little chicken man alright we're ready to assemble you know the drill slice and always toast your buns beautifully then from there hit the bottom layer with a generous spoonful of your magic mushroom mayo four big thick coins of bread and butter pickles and yes i think planks are better eating wise but you know we're seeking nostalgia for this one so before anyone runs to the comments and whines and whines you know now next your little prince aka your hit the top bun with mayo and finally crown your absolute king stare at it with great desire and intention and get ready to go on a ride directly out of the pits of hell do a flip and into the great white pearly gates of flavortown okay wow look at that visually oh just slid right off everyone was like josh you're squishing the sandwich no this is legitimately just how they come pre-squashed all right i'll give it a little bite here we go what do you want me to say it's juicy it's loose it's goosey i think that's where the rhymes stop everything about this sandwich is so balanced it's salty rich fatty crunchy got a little bit of spice in the back and the sweetness of the bread and butter pickle instead of using a normal regular old bill you get some sweetness in there that helps balance out all that salty richness the garlic mayo listen do i think we won what the hell do you think now we need a taste tester tell me how you want your sandwich little man number one all right number two oh i went mmm that's an obvious one this one's yours by a landslide this one it's got that good buttery taste from the buns you know the garlic comes through very well pickles are better the buns are better the chicken melts in your mouth and this is just dry i can individually taste spices on this one okay that rounds out today's episode of butt better i don't know what number it is but it's a big one because we do a lot of these all the time and you like them so much you know who the winner is there's nothing left to say we've done this before every time we go around and around with the chicken sandwiches we've done the popeye we've done the other one we're back to this kfc there's a new colonel in town you know people say i look like colonel sanders do you know that i feel like that's a bad thing you want to know what else has a chickeny crunch so deep that it makes our forefathers cry b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made the kfc chicken sandwich perfectly beautifully it was the most properly sized and shaped sandwich of chicken that we've made on this channel you can't always predict how the chicken's going to fry sometimes it curls a little bit does a little you know you can't really control that but this one was very symmetrical actually very much of the greasing ideal of a little fried chicken if the greasians knew about fried chicken dude did they can we do a quick fact checking on that did the greeks know in ancient times about fried chicken oh wow look at that don't know what that says but hopefully it's good i don't have anything else to say other than you must try this and if you are gonna do it do it all the way okay don't half make it make everything put everything together put all the love into it have your friends come over and enjoy probably one of the greatest chicken sandwich meals of your entire life do i need to say more no so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you okay next time holy i hit my glasses real hard [Music] you

Additional...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, the first time we did this we went head-to-head with my girlfriend and now we go head-to-head with the woman who taught me how to cook in the first place [Music] okay so we're back again doing another challenge last time it was emma before that it was kate both of them did pretty good this is your first time on here it may not be your last who knows maybe you'll come on again i don't know how this is going to go but today we're going to be making an eggs benedict as perfectly and culinarily as possible have you ever made an egg benedict not a real one well today we're making a really real one just store-bought muffins there's nothing wrong with that we are gonna be making it properly but with a little bit of a twist fellas please i'm not scared all right we'll see about that i'm a little bit scared now she's going to follow along to every instruction that i do only verbally because she can't see visually my mom has a lot of natural ability cooking she's she's going to doubt herself here and be all like oh i don't know it's probably going to look better than mine i'm going to be embarrassed i'm going to see embarrass josh with a red plum face since you haven't done a holidays mom how do you think today's gonna go there's a 50 50 chance i'm gonna survive 50 50. wait have you made a poached egg before yes oh then you're gonna be fine that to me is the hardest part here is poaching the egg and that is why i chose eggs benedict it's not necessarily easy because it requires technique gotta make the hollandaise perfectly without breaking the emulsion you gotta make the poached eggs perfectly without ruining the poached egg it has to be plated nicely so with all that said i think we're ready to go ahead and do this shall we so crack all your eggs not into the big bowl hang on sorry let me let me take your eggs out of the small bowl and crack them all in the bowl that they were in can't break them oh that's right maybe don't do that where do i put the shells i said go ahead and separate the yolks what yeah gotta crack them and separate them are you separating your yolk not yet i'm still cracking an egg still cracking kind of get that water coming up to a bit of a simmer so for everyone who doesn't know we're making the hollandaise first you should always make the hollandaise first you don't want to have all your eggs done and everything ready and you're like oh no i forgot the hollandaise we have our three yolks into the bigger bowl are you ready with the yolks ready with the yolks okay so start whisking just the yolks don't put them over the bowl yet or so the pot and you're gonna whisk them really vigorously and we're just gonna keep on whisking them we're doing this for like probably like a minute essentially you want like a pale yellow you want them to start to turn a little bit lighter in color i don't see that uh-oh well you better get the whisking girl you're doing great mom alright you're doing great you got to believe they're the same [Music] oh god so you're now going to place it over your bon marie which should be steaming but not boiling place your bowl over the bun marie you know how to do that and then keep whisking now this part is very crucial should you not whisk going to turn into a crust and cook not want to cook your yolks i don't want to cook my yolks here mom here's a spatula i'm going to give you the good one watch out there thank you you're not making scrambled eggs over there are you trying to yes i am you're trying to make scrambled eggs yeah i'm trying to so once the yolks start to thicken a little bit you'll notice that are you seeing that very thick it's very thick okay take it off the heat for a sec probably getting a little too hot now get that butter now we're gonna be adding butter one tablespoon at a time back onto the bon marie all right is it looking thickened yeah it's very thick so go ahead and add in one tablespoon of butter and whisk that in quickly it'll melt and emulsify in there definitely don't stop whisking how's your arm feeling tired i didn't know i was gonna have a workout here yeah well here we are now we're gonna add another tablespoon and you're just gonna keep doing this basically until you've added about eight to ten tablespoons not all at once one tablespoon at a time a little bit lumpy look that's not a good sign we're gonna be going to and from the bon marie and i'm gonna keep whisking in butter i just whisk in another tablespoon this is why nobody makes hollandaise anymore what i'm saying [Music] this is your dish mom put your put your flare into it how's the hollandaise looking creamy creamy good stuff and i'm gonna add just a tiny little sprinkle of cayenne it's spicy you want a lot of salt don't be afraid of it it's a cayenne add your lemon juice to taste but don't thin it out too much dye it over here and it was the cayenne that got her oh yeah mine's perfect look at that open up your thermos and then place your sieve on top and then add in all that hollandaise it's not going through the sieve baby yeah you want it to go through the sieve it's not oh i'm concerned you should be what this is oh josh it's going to take all day how thick did you make it what is it i'm closing my uh whatever this is called ramekin i'm not gonna have enough sauce next up we have the english muffins now i've already made the dose i made it a little easy on me here today oh thank you i'm gonna punch it down for you and i'm gonna give you your own portion of it all right okay i kind of wanted to punch it there you go now place it in a lightly flour your board and get that on there do i do anything to it seven equal pieces you got your seven pieces fold the sides in and together around and then roll it roll it into a medium top ball know how to do this just lightly cornmeal an area just so that you can have a place to place the balls ball placement area i don't want to make a joke about that because it's my mom did i put too much flour down i don't put any flour down right so get a piece of dough and you're going to kind of stretch and bring in all the sides in straight to the center then flip it over so the seam side is down and then roll it around the work surface kind of keeping your fingers constantly intact with the board and you're rolling it in circles and it should form into a nice round little ball just like oh it's not doing anything i want it to do get it roll it around like this it's a ball i don't know what it looks like but i sure hope it's a ball well i'm done with all my balls so are you done with yours it's a good way to get an aneurysm i'm just going to cover them to keep them just let them rest for a few minutes yay joshua get your cornmeal dust the top really generously dust the bottom flatten that with the palm of your hand into a nice little disc it's so cute yes it's very rubbery that's not a good sign it should be pretty soft i will griddle it for you oh that's so nice actually these look these look pretty good we're going to toss these over i'm going to griddle these mine will go on to the right i got my peaches out for georgia this is too wholesome where's the battle music where's the detention it can't be any because it's my mommy these are little baby ones why are you shaking so i think we're ready to flip

moms look at that we made some behemoth ones that is going into the oven just to finish baking we're gonna make our the muffins are done i'm going to pull them out they both look beautiful it's already a great start for you oh good they're a little big respectfully while that's all cooling get your oil add that to your pan just enough to coat the bottom we're going to sear this ham can we open some windows because this could get a little smoky let's get our ham we need two slices nice well i like my ham kind of thick you know so i'm gonna go like a quarter a little over a quarter it's like a third of an inch i would say that's pretty thick yeah what's wrong with that i think you gave me a dull knife so anyway we cut the ham that'll do what's going on with this two pieces i'm gonna have to play ketchup now oh my god pan's hot let's let those sear i'm gonna give mine a little flip oh yeah now that we flip these get your garlic head cut that in half the whole thing the whole darn thing and then get like a good chunky bunch or two of your thyme and then get you a butter add a couple knobs of butter nice size going it's going i'm letting it melt and then you're going to start basting all that fire no we're good what no it's okay we're good look at that look at that should be nice and foamy broccoli no i don't have foam should be nice and foamy put your finished ham on that plate you can leave some of the aromatics on there that's fine and add back a little bit of that butter directly onto the plate that's done are you done with the ham emotionally i'm done with the ham okay workstation is reset is your workstation reset no what am i what we have two things left we have to toast our english muffins we have to make our poached egg so we're gonna start heating our water we've got a little pot of water look we don't want this a rolling boil here are your english muffins they smell like pizza pork split am i forks pudding now yeah shoot i want to eat that into the toaster smells like burning oh my god this stinks people are dying from this they have to be god i have a headache now grab your vinegar add a little splash to your water it's a little bit of i'm gonna add another sploop what kind of measurement is that toasting we've got our water going all right get your uh self an egg crack that into your ramekin don't break the yolk not a yolk breaker i have an egg in the ramekin first egg's going to go in using your spoon it won't come up late normally i wouldn't be this nice but it's mama it's good it's perfect begin swirling your water in one direction only really really really strong nice whirlpool and then that egg is going to get dropped gently right into that center oh that's perfect we're just gonna let that cook for about three minutes crack your next egg into the ramekin just have that ready i wouldn't add it yet so i'm gonna take mine out give it a little tap 20 more seconds tops i could just tell by feeling it you know oh feels done pull yourself then yep all done eggs coming out and going on the towel i got a nice strong whirlpool and my egg is going in i just broke my hand ow you're right need to bit hot we burn our hands all the time i don't have the patience to try to lift things with utensils see vikram and that's why i have nerve damage nerve damage might be thinking josh aren't we done well no we gotta get

let's get ready to assemble i've had our hollandaise kept warm over here as you should pop that onto your plate now before we put on the ham i've got a little bit of butter with the ham and all the aromatics i'm just going to spoon some of that butter onto the muffin sort of like garlicky ham butter for hammy boys i think my hand's a little bit thick [Laughter] poached egg carefully transfer that on those things are overcooked the moment of truth the hollandaise drizzle are you ready ready i'm pouring oh god it won't come out i'm putting a lot more because i love it next we're going to need some cayenne but my cayenne fell off the table and broke that's okay i used peppery things cayenne a little bit of cayenne on top a little bit of flaky salt you should have some down below boom boom right in the center a little crack of black pepper if you don't mind and then we're going to finish it and then we're going to finish that with your lovely chives feast your eyes um how do you think yours looks i think it looks lovely okay are we ready ready okay hey that looks great that was great i was worried thank you baby so good she added the time look she even kind of styled it like i do you looked up a video that hammers that hairless dick i see what you're saying i see what you're saying about it ah i see what happened that's okay he just took him a little less she knows how to cook them properly it was just a mistake i was going with your timer oh oh you want to blame the timer that's weird because mine are perfectly cooked hold on uh is it the timer let's taste test okay so we're going to dig into these but hold on we've got our beautiful holidays okay yes we switch wait you seem nervous i overcook the eggs it's fine i've been eating your food for almost my well at least my whole life literally how can you be nervous we'll get a yolk test on this one let's see how it goes look at that you have high standards this is beautiful here comes the yolk test yeah mine's overcooked there we go okay it's not it's not over it's a little it's a little over oh this one's perfect okay there we go can you get through that ham you always butter the english muffin perfectly that's one thing i've noticed it's delicious it's great i like the thickness of the ham oh that's so good let's go we made the mama happy and that's all that matters today this is so good yeah let's switch back everything here is seasoned perfectly the eggs are seasoned nicely perfect amount of butter what do you think about the hollandaise yeah the hollandaise is great the flavor's really good it's seasoned literally perfectly i feel like mine's probably too acidic if i had to guess no it is not oh yeah no it's good and they're both kind of the same these are identical joshua's has more flavor only because i added more lemon juice aha the thing i like more about yours is that the ham is more in accordance to the thickness of the bread this one the ham is too thin it gets overwhelmed by the english muffin all things considered both of these beautiful benedict both had a perfect egg we both had a slightly over egg what does that mean that means that the heat got out of control but

But we don't stop there, we're taking it further and bringing the cheesy Korean corn dog also known as the Gamja Dog to the home. Then maybe we'll...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, oh yes fair food one of the things that our childhood gravitates to we're falling through all the rides and the yummy corn dogs and yet it's one of those food areas that hasn't really evolved and i think it's time [Music] okay so today we're making corn dogs but not just regular corn dogs do we ever do it regularly here huh do we making them at home means you have all the leverage you can do anything you want you can use any kind of sausage make your own sausage use any hot dog you could stuff it with ham if you wanted to instead see where i'm going with this think we're not gonna stop there we're gonna make the ultra famous korean corn dog and although it's not necessarily as focused on corn and more so a panko fried sort of pancake battered potato encrusted cheese stick hot dog we want to bring corn dogs back into the world in a way that they always should have been so with all that said let's make this shall we well well well welcome to the cornfield let me break this down quickly we got mr regular corn dog okay nothing wrong with that and the new king in town or what i believe to be the korean corn dog so we shouldn't waste any more time and let's begin with mr traditional because it's unbelievably and downright easy granted if you were to make your own hot dogs then it would take multiple hours longer but it would also be volumes better so hey do whatever the heck you want but first start heating enough oil in a pot wide enough to fit your dogs and skewers in easily fill it up about halfway or three quarters of the way with vegetable oil and begin heating it to 350 fahrenheit now for your little gondog batter get a medium sized bowl and add three quarters of a cup or 140 grams of fine cornmeal one and a quarter cup or 188 grams of all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons or 9 grams of baking powder 1 teaspoon or 5 grams of fine sea salt and 2 tablespoons or 30 grams of granulated sugar which i forgot at this stage whoops real nice josh looking like a true professional right now but it's fine i added it at the end and a geese from papa if you don't act like a buffoon like this anyway give your dry mix some whiskey [Music] until thoroughly incorporated then in a separate container with together one large egg two and a half tablespoons or 32 grams of vegetable oil and one and a quarter cup or 295 milliliters of buttermilk add the wet stuff to your dry stuff so that your dry stuff becomes wet then whisk all that together until you get a homogeneous batter if it's too thick feel free to add a small splash of buttermilk but be aware that you want it thick enough to hold onto your waner when you dip with that being said get yourself eight hot dogs or sausages of choice if it was me i would obviously use a nice quality thick boy sausage rather than a hot dog but then using thick wooden skewers link in the description for the ones i used drive that skewer through your wiener lengthwise as to keep the skewer as centered as possible until the entire wiener is skewered then repeat with all your wieners once your oil is 350 degrees fahrenheit pour your batter into a tall skinny glass dunk one of your wieners into the batter then while constantly turning your wiener add it to your oil repeat with one to two more dogs and fry for about three to five minutes turning often or until the corn dog is fried and has reached a beautiful brown color remove from the oil and drain on a wire rack then repeat with the rest of your dwargs that's actually it this is a very simple version so enjoy it simply dip it in some ketchup some mustard depending on your personal preference or both and enjoy before we move on let's give this quick fair food a scrutinizing taste test and see how we did here i'm greasy this is greasy it's like a classic carnival day it's hot outside it smells kind of bad like you could smell the backed up sewage but you're just excited to eat this corn dog for some odd reason even though you literally smell sewage so you go on a ride and you go around and around you start sweating and this is what you want you disgust me ketchup mustard however you do it little dunk i don't want to eat this on camera i feel like i need to use a fork and a knife but the internet desires this is so we'll get the internet what they want i guess this is what every coin dog should be when it comes to a good corn dog it should be crisp on the outside but cakey on the inside the hot dog should burst juice into your mouth salty a little bit of sweetness from the dough smoky from the dog doing it with a hot dog [Music] if i had to choose between these two i would definitively choose the properly made sausage and you could use whatever you want you want and dewey great you want something a little smokier great bratwurst get a little germanic put some german mustard on there you got a multicultural dog on your hands so to this one i would say and this one i say you can choose whichever option you want you know where i stand it's delicious but we gotta take this up a notch and make a korean style corndog oh yeah so first off let's begin with skewering because these need to stay very cold get yourself eight skewers yet again four hot dogs or sausages cut those bad boys in half like so so you get eight pieces then get yourself a nice block of mozzarella and cut that into eight 2.5 inch rectangular segments also what shape really is this is this like a rectangular prism i i don't know i didn't go to college so all right to do this properly first start by skewing a dog with the cut side of it facing upward then follow that with a piece of mozzarella skewering that lengthwise and now you have a skewer with half dog half cheese it's a beautiful thing now once you have all of your skewers place them on a tray and then into the refrigerator to keep very cold until needed next we're gonna make our yeasted batter first start with one cup or 240 milliliters of warm water around 98 fahrenheit to that you're gonna add one teaspoon or four grams of instant yeast whisk that in then in a medium sized bowl add one and a half cups or 225 grams of all-purpose flour half a teaspoon or two grams of fine sea salt three tablespoons or 42 grams of granulated sugar then give that some whiskey little pan span business then to that you're going to add your yeasty milk mixture and whisk together until completely smooth and homogeneous cover that with plastic wrap give it a personality with a classy and commendable name and let it rise for 30 minutes before using now while that's rising let's prep the rest of our stuff if you know about korean corn dogs then you know about that with potato crust but i think i have a way to make it even quiff to do that get yourself two russet potatoes peel them and cut them into half-inch cubes then place them in a pot cover with water season generously with salt bring to a boil over medium high heat and let those cook for about two to three minutes or until just barely cooked through immediately drain them and place them on a sheet tray and in the refrigerator to cool completely and until it's time to prepare now while your potatoes are cooling the batter is halfway done rising let's make a quick sweet and spicy gochujang mayo in a medium bowl add half a cup or 120 grams of mayonnaise a quarter cup or 56 grams of sriracha one tablespoon or 15 grams of gochujang one tablespoon or 17 grams of honey one tablespoon or 14 grams of rice vinegar and finally one teaspoon or five grams of toasted sesame oil then just mix all that together and that's your splendidly addicting mayonnaise okay it's assembly time yet again get your batter into a tall skinny glass and get your station put together we've got our oil set to 350 fahrenheit we got three and a half cups or 200 grams of panko bread crumbs in a nice wide container like this shallow half hotel or you can use an 8x8 baking pan the potatoes are cooled and laid out on a baking sheet and then doing this is very simple but you need to move fairly quickly first dunk a cheesy dog to completely coat in the batter then quickly roll it in the potato to coat all sides transfer it to your panko while constantly turning to keep the coating from sagging onto one side and generously coat in the panko on every square inch every wet spot needs to be stuck with panko okay every wet spot remember what i said about dry spots with fried chicken and singles with anything bro tired of explaining it then carefully add that to your fry oil i wouldn't recommend doing more than two to three of these at a time then just let that bad boy fry for about three to four minutes or until it turns a beautiful crusted golden brown color and you can just barely see some of the cheese beginning to ooze out which means the inside is very cooked and done pull it out place on a wire rack and immediately season while it's still hot with a light sprinkle of granulated sugar yes it's traditional and some kosher salt as well and i mean look at this thing it looks like some sort of diamond studded marvel of food on a stick i can already tell this is going to have the cheese pull of the century so let's observe that and see if we've crowned a new corn dog king of the fair food world let us taste test oh are you hearing now all corn dogs can now cease to exist please because this is the greatest corn dog on earth now is it a corn dog there's no actual corn in this you could add corn to the batter should you wish but this is easily one of the greatest foods of all time i'm not saying that just to be big and astronomical and fancy if you've never made this before or you've never had this before let me explain to you that a korean corn dog will literally change your entire life you won't stop thinking about them you're gonna sleep next to this you're gonna fry one and sleep next to it this is what you spend the rest of your life with it's what you get married to there's no contest this is the only dog maybe not with the spike you see what makes this perfect is you get the best of both worlds it's basically a mozzarella stick corn dog with crispy potatoes and it's crunchy in the panko and it's like katsu and dog and there's so many things all at once the textures the crunch the softness of the potato the saltiness of the mozzarella the cheese pulled the chew and the cured sausage in here bro a little fatty sausage in your mouth dude out of here you wanna know what else has papa's hot winner battered and fried b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our corn dogs two different ways we had the original very very sort of classic hot dog dipped in dude thing of course you can make your own hot dogs i already have a guide for that and you can go click the link in the description you want to learn how to do that okay ready and of course you can put anything else in the traditional corn dog ham maybe it's a big piece of pork belly gone and fried why am i doing this boy so much and then of course last and definitely not least is the korean corn dog the ganja dog in my opinion the only way a corn dog should have ever been in the first place and i'm not sure i'll ever make an original classic version ever again after tasting that and i hope you feel the same way but with all that said if you enjoyed this

Additional Cookbook...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, so it's nice that you're going out with your family to eat at a nice italian restaurant and you decide you're gonna order lasagna and it's this much uh-oh spaghettios when you could be making it simply for this price per person right here that is but cheaper [Music] so when it comes to the lasaga it can get a little bit expensive it can get a little fancy but i want to make this as simple and easy and inexpensive as physically possible so we're going to break this down into each and every element the noodles the cheese choice and how you make your sauce make the sauce simply and we're going to compare whether or not homemade from scratch noodles made by hand are better than just going to the store and buying them yourself and i'm talking about price and flavor by the way never skip on the flavor but with that said let's make this shall we there are many areas we can look to make this cheaper there's the pasta itself cheese choices and of course the sauce as maximally flavorful as humanly possible while keeping the cost lower than the ground is that even possible i don't know the first place i want to get into is of course going to be the lasagna pasta is it really cheaper to make it from scratch does it taste better from scratch i fear for what the answer could be let's just rip the band-aid off and do this in order to make those you'll need a large bowl start off with 2 cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour create a nice little well in that flour careful don't fall in buddy then to that you're going to add three egg yolks and two whole eggs start beating those eggs together with a fjork while slowly incorporating the flour until you get a shaggy dough then pour that out onto the counter and begin kneading by hand if the dough isn't picking up much more flour and it's just kind of going all over the place then discard the excess dry flour and continue kneading your dough until it's completely smooth then wrap that in plastic wrap and let that rest for 30 minutes then divide that dough into four even segments shape it to an oval and roll it out until it's a little under a half an inch thick then run that through a pasta roller starting at the widest setting working your way to about a number four setting which would be around an eighth of an inch thick now those are sheets worthy of giving a sheet a buyout get it repeat this process with all of your segments of dough now from those sheets measure them up to match the length of a 9x13 pan cut those segments in half or thirds depending on their width lengthwise to get yourself a total of about 10 to 12 sheets that's really it they're ready to boil so with all that being said the pricing of the homemade pasta comes out to this right here now let's boil one of these along with the store-bought version and decide if this is the cheapest and best tasting option or not we did the math it turns out that this goes for this price right here and this is sort of like in the dollar fifty two dollar range so it's almost identical give or take so then it comes down to the quality of flavor oh god it's robot it's got good chew and it tastes like pasta people always say oh there's no difference between store-bought and fresh pasta wrong you're all lying to yourselves if you keep saying that i'm sick of hearing it there is a difference but there's a caveat the caveat is this this ain't cheap and neither is this the point is that you're gonna have to spend extra money in order to even make it yourself you could roll it with a rolling pin but it's just it's not the same all things considered flavor time effort money spent this is always gonna be your cheapest option this is the best flavor okay so it turns out you can really go either route but obviously homemade pasta will be the best taste and texture in this case but store-bought is fine now let's talk schwartz remember sauce is the boss of flavor in lasagna so take good care of it get yourself a pot or dutch oven that's at least 5 quarts and heat up about 2 tablespoons or 30 grams of vegetable oil over medium high heat then once that's hot hot shoopie donkey add in 1 pound or 450 grams of ground beef three quarters of a pound or 340 grams of ground pork press and let that sear for three minutes flip and sear on the other side for about two to three more minutes then using a potato masher mash all that until it's very fine transfer that to a separate container add a touch more oil if needed then add 5 cloves of garlic thinly sliced reduce the heat to medium and let that cook stirring occasionally until the garlic begins to toast and turn a golden brown then add one yellow onion finely diced and season the taste with salt stir then let that saute until the onion has begun to turn translucent then add 2 teaspoons or 4 grams of fennel seed powder and any other spices if you want them although not necessary maybe some red pepper flakes if you want a little spicy stir that together and saute until fragrant about 30 seconds then add one six ounce can of tomato paste stir and let that cook until it begins to caramelize and stick to the bottom of the pan about another minute then add one 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes stir that in and then add your meaty man baxter again there's a lot of stirring here and let that simmer and reduce for five to seven minutes or until slightly thickened season the taste with salt and pepper and that is your swasti little guy next in a medium bowl add 15 ounces or 425 grams of ricotta which for those of you who don't use ricotta frequently and by the way what are you doing if you're not that is typically going to be a whole regular sized tub usually season that lightly with salt and pepper optionally some olive oil but that's expensive so don't do that i'm just being a silly man here then add in one whole egg and whisk all that together until smooth and homogeneous now we're almost ready to assemble but first we cannot forget about our nudes if you're using homemade pasta when you're cooking it you're only gonna boil it for about 30 to 45 seconds in store bought you'll just follow the recommended time minus one minute to get them a little under al dente since they're going to go in the oven after this just please remember to generously season your pasta water if you want this to be good at all always nearly as salty as the ocean homies now for the cheese just mix together 8 ounces or 225 grams of grated mozzarella you can get a cheap block for about two dollars and just grate the whole thing then mix that with a third cup or 80 grams of parmesan cheese now hear me out parmigiano reggiano is the best option like that pronunciation by the way italians can we get a can we get a rating please on that wow that's got a absolute unit out of ten so i'll take that anyway that's the most expensive option but you should choose a cheese that's like parmigiano or one of the you know parmesan cheeses i'm not going to recommend that but that is the cheaper option and it costs this much so i don't control the market price of parmigiano okay but i wish i did call me the parmigiano king pin assembly is ridiculously easy and people get tripped up about it for no reason at all so here's all you need to know first put one cup of sauce at the bottom of a nine by 13 baking dish spread it edge to edge from there add two to three sheets of lasagna depending on their width so that it also goes edge to edge such as this add on a third of your ricotta mixture spread it out follow by a third of your cheese mixture then next up another cup of sauce spread that brother out two to three more lasagna sheets the next third of your ricotta mixture the next third of your cheese another layer of sauce more lasagna sheets your remaining ricotta and this time another ladle which should be the last ladle of your sauce then finish with the rest of your cheese if you want or need more cheese feel free to add it but that's going to cost you extra sun then add some greased foil on top of your baking tray dish whatever the hell they're called wrap it tightly and pop it into an oven preheated to 375 fahrenheit for 25 minutes then uncover it and cook an additional 30 to 35 minutes or until stunning bubbly patches of deep brown cheese with craggly edges emerge i mean look at this this is a proper lasagna those little crispy bits on the edge will have you wetting your pants while yodeling on a mountain top don't ask me why now just let that rest for 15 minutes to cool slightly then using a sharp knife cut into 12 evenly sized square pieces pop it on a plate and let's see if we just made the most darn delicious and simple lasagnas for this price per person right here okay we have a beautiful layer did you see that catch lasaga now before we even begin talking about the price which is this right here very nice let's talk about this lasaga which is hot okay listen carefully all right it just looks beautiful i can cut it in still layered you can enjoy it as it's meant to be and it was meant to be absolutely boring noodles cook perfectly it still has body it still has texture to it you've got each individual noodle your teeth crash through every layer into the cheese the meat the caramelized tomato sauce i mean this is better than any average lasagna and yet it is less expensive than most la saga that ain't but cheaper i don't know what the gosh darn heck is you get out there and you make a lasaga because it's not that hard and it's your greatest dinner party yet and your cheapest you want to know what else has papa's hot steamy sauce all over it b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our lasagna and it turned out quite good and for this price grand total in this price per person and that's for a generous serving by the way with a little bit of cheese on it that's about as good and cheap as the lasagna is gonna get we're gonna go to the frozen island go get your frozen lasagna and reheat it oh yeah don't you love pasta sauce that tastes identical to ketchup disgusting point is you can make your lasagna however you please but if you follow this guide first get yourself in there if you've never cooked before this is a great place to start and save money at the same time with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time i can't go any lower okay i'm a big man [Music] you

We are making our own homemade hot dogs, that's how far we...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, i want you to imagine something first imagine a hot dog then imagine a hot dog in a bun put some mustard in ketchup and everyone thinks it's a complete dog you're missing out on one of the greatest american food combinations of all time and we're gonna correct that [Music] this is going to be about two main things dogs and a proper chili not any chili specifically a cincinnati chili think you know skyline first i want to talk about hot dogs and since a good one is hard to come by we're gonna make our own obviously we do that around here we're gonna make our own buns we're making everything and we're gonna make the ultimate chili cheese dog that has ever existed on the planet the point is we're combining all these classic techniques to make the best version of an american classic but you know what else is a great combo home and car insurance and that's where today's sponsor geico comes in combining your home and car insurance could save you even more and of course for bundling made easy visit geico.com today head to the link in the description and see how much you could save now with all that said let's make this shall we the greatest chili cheese dogs that ever existed maybe yes maybe no who were making the hot dogs the buns and of course the most important cincinnati style chili but let's start with our homemade dwarfs look i could say this is easy but i'd be completely and entirely lying to you but you know what if the greatest things in the world were easy then they wouldn't be as great so you're gonna need to start with some sheep casings link in bio for those or you can use vegetarian casings if you find that yucky wacky but papa keeps things traditional rinse off the salt from the casings then soak them in warm water for one hour i like to change the water out halfway but that's optional while that's soaking you'll need 3 pounds or 1.3 kilos of boneless pork shoulder and 3 pounds or 1.3 kilos of beef chuck roast and guess what boneless that hurt my mouth cut those into long strips that will fit into whatever grinder you have yes we're grinding our own come on you know me of course you can buy pre-ground but where's the fun in that and if you have a stand mixer you can go and snack a grinder attachment and for that the link is in de bio anyway once your meat has been sliced and maybe slapped a little set up your meat grinder and well let it rip grind all of your beef and pork until it's um ground and i found that in order to get that really fine texture that hot dogs have after you've ground all your meat give it one more pass through the grinder to get it then once that's done need that puppy like there's no tomorrow for about 30 seconds actually adding a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of ice water halfway through that process then once it comes together and is incorporated you think it might be done well hang on you're not quite done working on your meat there bud in a separate bowl combine one tablespoon or 15 grams of brown sugar two and a half tablespoons or 24 grams of smoked paprika one tablespoon or 12 grams of garlic powder 5 grams of prague powder number one now listen carefully to five grams you understand don't get all weird and try to do this in teaspoons this stuff is dangerous if not handled properly so please use a scale and the parameters that i've written here keeping it safe for the little babies [Music] two tablespoons or five grams of mustard powder two and a half tablespoons or 45 grams of kosher salt two teaspoons or five grams of fresh cracked black pepper and lastly 72 grams of a sausage binder flour such as soy protein concentrate this is optional but it does help maintain some moisture during the cooking process whisk it together and then realize you also forgot the one tablespoon or five grams of coriander seeds you know forgetting that actually helps contribute to the flavor so that that's a lie whisk all that together then add half a cup or 120 milliliters of ice water and you'll essentially get a thick paste now add that paste to your meat roll up them sleeves and get to work you're gonna need this for three to five minutes yup you're going to the gym today whether you want to or not sorry you can go quiet about it later you'll know it's done when it's emulsified and you get a tacky texture like this now comes the easy part get a sheep casing switch to a sausage stuffer which if you listened to papa you'd also have that with your meat grinder stand mixer attachment this sounds like an ad it's really not i just like using this line your stuffer with the casing and get to fill in i have a more detailed sausage guide if you need more context on filling but honestly it's really straightforward and you literally just fill it up now once that casing is full pop it off twirl it into hot dog length segments and well that's it from there just rinse and repeat with the rest of your casings and meat this makes a lot of hot dogs maybe like 40 to 60 depending on the casing you use but you're welcome to freeze half the meat and stuff the other half now once that's done pop those buds in the fridge uncovered to dry overnight now let's start our next day off with our buns these are the exact same buns for many of the butt butters and most recently the big mac so if you want to see how to make that dough then go and watch that video link in the bio now once your dough has been risen and is fatty oh so punch the absolute life and win out of it cut it into about 100 gram pieces which will get you 10 to 12 total buns roll those into light balls cover with a damp towel and rest for 15 minutes then take your balls and gently roll them into six inch logs then line them up in a single file line like you're at the dmv but instead the dmv is actually a parchment-lined baking sheet see it's like the same thing but not at all then cover with another inverted baking sheet and proof for 30 minutes now once your weiner holders are puffed brush them all with one beaten egg and toss into a preheated oven set to 375 fahrenheit for 15 to 18 minutes or until a beautiful deep golden brown then just finish them off with a beautiful brushing of melted butter optionally a little sprinkle of flaky salt on each of them and those are some absolute gourmet wiener pillows okay one more thing before we smoke these dogs the most important cincinnati chili i know cincinnati is watching so i hope i don't get yelled at in the comments but i probably will so who cares first step big heavy bottom pot heat up a couple tablespoons of vegetable oil or in my case lard over medium high heat till the oil is hot hot donkey then add in one and a half pounds or 650 grams of ground beef flatten it out and let that sear for three to four minutes or until you get a nice crust toss it around and continue to cook for a total of five to eight minutes using a potato masher in between to get the beef nice and fine now this is how you be a culinary height beast until the beef is cooked through and has some good color to it then remove it from the pot place it aside get a little more oil into that pot and then add three to four cloves of garlic crushed by hand let those cook for two minutes or until they begin to turn golden and then add one sweet onion that's been grated then all you gotta do is cook that until most of the liquid has been sweat off and the onion has turned translucent then add one six ounce or 170 gram can of tomato paste toss that together and cook until the tomato paste begins to stick and caramelize add some salt to taste one and a half teaspoons or five grams of ground cumin one tablespoon or 12 grams of garlic powder one teaspoon or four grams of ground cinnamon half a teaspoon or three grams of red pepper flakes oh my god i'm running out of breath this is ridiculous half a teaspoon or three grams of granulated sugar a quarter cup or 32 grams of chili powder not paprika or spicy chili powder i'm talking chili mix chili powder you know for chili because we're making chili a quarter teaspoon each of ground nutmeg and allspice how many ingredients did i add this did i even look at this recipe before i made it sew that together and saute until fragrant about 30 seconds then add four and a quarter cup or one liter of water stir that together then add all your beef back bring that up to a boil over high heat then immediately reduce to low and simmer for one to one and a half hours stirring occasionally or until reduced and thickened don't overdo the thickness i know we all like things nice and thick but just stay calm we want some level of fluidity here something like this then adjust the salt levels as needed and that's your chili from cincinnati except not really because it wasn't made in cincinnati was actually made in texas but that's fine you see where i'm going with this okay thank you lastly we need to smoke the dogs this can be done while the chili is being made obviously and to do that set a smoker to 200 to 250 fahrenheit get it nice and well smoky get your sausages in there obviously this would be better with a vertically shaped smoker or a smoker that has hooks to hang the sausages but you know what right on the grates is just fine all the sausage makers are crying right now by the way and i will use your tears to cure my next batch of sausage then just smoke those bad boys for 30 to 40 minutes or an internal temperature of 155 fahrenheit is achieved then immediately remove from the smoker snip them at their twirled ends and place them in a cold ice water bath for 15 minutes or until they've reached 90 to 100 fahrenheit then dry them off with paper towels then use them in whatever way you want immediately and refrigerate or freeze the rest for later i'm not going to tell you how to make a hot dog okay if you don't know how to do it fine i'll give you a little piece i did this in a pan i got some oil in it got it ripping hot and seared these for one to two minutes per side or until they were glossy and brown i mean look at these they're just glistening and now this leads us to our final moment of truth get your buns to them apart like so cut down the middle of the torn area open it up add in the hottest of dogs as much or as little chilly as you want raw onion is optional but you would add it here and lastly a sky-high pile of finely shredded cheddar cheese for the haters and this right here is a proper chili cheese dough that any hot dog eating contest winner would shake in their boots looking at now let's find out if all this effort all this hard work was truly worth it oh whoa be careful there josh all right okay so we have a hot dog and all it took was 26 hours of hard backbreaking work and that's how i like it now cincinnati style chili al dogs first off look at these wieners i'm gonna give it a snap let's see if they snap oh let's just eat this we've been working all day for this hot dog it better be good this isn't just a hot dog this is a hot dog this is like a luxurious chili cheese dog it has all the classic traditional flavors that it should have but it's just really good it's almost raunchy how good this is the wiener is perfectly cooked it's perfectly smoked there's actual flavor it's not just like oh i'm eating a hot dog it's like no no i'm eating the finest cuisine hot dog that i can and the chili is perfectly spiced as it should be whether you're from cincinnati or not this is a chili cheese dog that you will never forget you want to know what else is full of cheese on top of meat that's also on top of more meat b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it thank you again to our

It’s easy to make, but it requires the knowledge and technique to make it truly great. Today we go head...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, so we've covered many of the reigning kings in the burger world the french fry world the chicken nugget world but we cannot miss one of the most important regions chicken wings [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today we're making buffalo wild wings but uh but better but we're not just gonna make the wings better right the way that you cook them there's many ways to do it and we'll discuss that later i don't just want to do one sauce i'm gonna do multiple so i took to our discord which by the way if you're not into discord the link is in the description you really should be on there because you can participate and help making these videos and yada yada yada yada we did a poll asking which people's favorite sauces were we took some put them together and now we're doing three sauces the parmesan garlic the asian zing which is like from where from what part of asia you understand how large this region is and the mango habanero we're not only going to defeat them once not twice but three times so with all that said let's make this shall we well they all have horrible ratings this one has four stars oh i'd like to place in order for it to go let's do 15 of the parmesan garlic 15 of the mango habanero 15 of the asian zinc no blue cheese um yeah no it's horrible can i do um do you guys have ranch yesterday okay that's perfect right it's like blue cheese isn't even that good let's be honest finally yes i appreciate you even buffalo the representative of buffalo wild wings said yeah blue cheese is not good a strip mall buffalo wild wings why do i have this intense desire to not go in here i happen to go order for josh well i have the wings yay i've also never seen a restaurant that empty in my entire life even for coke it was more empty than empty let's go home big grim so we've got the a bag of ranch don't have a problem with that can you imagine if they just give us a bag filled with ranch so this is mango habanero asian zing these boxes are totally and the garlic parmesan that smells like a foot to be fair parmesan is stinky so i'll give them that god this thing is just let's start with asian zing by the way what what from where in asia is this fight the end off twist that bone out whisk the other bone out pull that out and you've got the wing with no bones all right yankee with no brim all right immediate thoughts first off chicken wings love them chickeny nice whatever second thought under season i always thought that they use their sauce as the crush right you gotta season the wings a little bit flavor the sauce boring it's like they took just sugar and sambal olek and that's the sauce yeah this thing is just falling apart invest in new boxes how much is this company worth invest in new boxes these are better kind of like these but already know what people are going to say they're going to go josh you got to do it with the butter like they do shut up they don't use the butter they use the sauce that they use everywhere else they're not gonna be like hey let's make a new distribution facility they're not doing that it's that sauce it tastes good does it taste like parmesan and garlic no no depth of flavor and to be frank it just tastes like old sauce so they're just nowhere near as good as they could be mango habanero what smell is that not mango okay i actually kind of like this one but with the caveat that it purely tastes like habanero with a little bit of sweetness no mango present tastes alright can we do better than these we can at least do better with the packaging but the answer is yes all right before we get started let's get our optional ranch conversation out of the way please look i want to say this carefully and lightly because i know it's a touchy subject and i want to be nice about it i hate blue cheese dressing with a fiery passion that breathes deep within my soul just a simple glance at a crinkle-to-go ramekin with its lid fogged up and dripping from the condensation of the putrefying depths below is just not my thing but with that said i have a resolution a simple and easy to make optional ranch so get a medium sized bowl and add two thirds of a cup of mayonnaise half a cup of creme fraiche half a cup of buttermilk quarter teaspoon of onion powder three cloves of garlic grated one and a half tablespoons of rough chopped parsley one tablespoon of finely chopped dill half a bunch of chives thinly sliced the zest and juice of half a lemon season that the taste with salt and pepper and give that some risky whiskey whiskey and that is your not blue cheese ranch dressing now look we're making three different wing sauces here asian zing whatever that is mango habanero and parmesan garlic but before we jump into those sauces let's talk wing prep please i don't want a metric ton of drumettes you want as close to a 50 50 selection of germets and flats remember flats are papa's favorite and by the way for any of these wing sauce recipes you'll need about four pounds of wings to serve four to six people so put those all in a bowl season them normally with salt toss them together to distribute cover and let those cure in the fridge for at least an hour but ideally overnight look you don't need to let them sit but if you do then the salt will penetrate all the way into the meat i like that seasoning going all the way to the bone brother all right the actual cooking of the wings is a large debate some say bake some say grill purists say fry i'm not a purist but in my opinion the longest lasting mind-numbingly quiffy most tender wings will fly out of a fryer so what i recommend is to pat your wings dry in batches then lower them into a large pot with at least three inches of fry oil that have been heated to 350 fahrenheit fry your wings in batches until they reach a pale golden color and are cooked through about four to five minutes remove them from the oil and trade on a wire rack and repeat with the rest of your wings now once those good old wangs have been par fried increase your oil temp to 375 and drop your wings in batches yet again for two to three more minutes or until they become beautifully browned and ultra crisp skinned pretty much this double fry method will never steer you wrong from there your wings are ready to be coated now see the benefit with this method is you can have your wings ready to be crisped up right when you're about to sauce them so now that we know how to do that let's break down each sauce first up is their asian zing in a medium sauce pot add one teaspoon of toasted sesame oil and one and a half tablespoons of vegetable oil heat that brother up over medium heat and once it's hot and shimmery add four cloves of rough chopped garlic cook that swirling often until the garlic begins to turn a toasted golden brown color then add a two inch knob of ginger that's been finely chopped saute that for two minutes or just until softened then add half a cup of granulated white sugar half a cup of dark soy sauce a quarter cup of regular soy sauce a quarter cup of mirin three quarters of a cup of rice vinegar one tablespoon of gochujang half a cup of bring that to a simmer then reduce the heat to low then just let that reduce for one to two minutes then in a bowl stir together three tablespoons of cornstarch and a quarter cup of water to get a slurry whisk only half of that slurry into your sauce and if it needs further thickening feel free to add more of the slurry after that turn off the heat add a small handful of thai basil which you know we actually ran out of so we'll pretend that we're not using regular basil here let that steep for five minutes and that is papa's sweet chili zing sauce or whatever the hell you want to call it now you can use this sauce right away or store it in the fridge and just warm it to loosen when ready to use so now all that's left is to crisp up your wings toss them into a bowl coat them generously with your sauce toss them roll em around with a spoon you do what you gotta do so you can suck that sauce out of every and any little crevice on that wine then just place those in a serving bowl top with green onion and those are your wings but hang on we got two more sauces here next up is mango habanero but you know with actual mangoes and it looks like what it's named so in a small saucepan add three quarters of a cup of water and three quarters of a cup of sugar heat and stir until the sugar is dissolved then get yourself four large ripe mangoes cut off their cheeks scoop out the flesh with a spoon and you know don't forget to get the trim around the mangoes oh and of course who could forget to suck on the seed trust papa always suck on the seed now keep up your mango flesh toss it into a blender along with your simple syrup that you just made blend that on high speed until completely and totally smooth pour that into a large skillet along with three tablespoons of frank's red hot whistle together and bring that to a light simmer over medium heat now while that's simmering in your blender add two cloves of garlic ten habanero chilies with their stems remove a quarter cup of lime juice and a half cup of white distilled vinegar blend that on high speed until as smooth as possible and optionally you can stream in about a teaspoon of oil just to get it even smoother give that a little whiff to get your nose on platinum same day shipping directly to hell pour your habanero puree into the simmering mango sauce stir together and let that simmer and reduce for five minutes or until nicely thickened then just season that to taste with salt and additional vinegar for extra acidity reduce another minute then add one and a half tablespoons of corn syrup whisk that in then add a quarter cup of room temperature unsalted butter and constantly whisk till the butter is completely melted and emulsified into the sauce for the record the corn syrup helps stabilize the emulsion and get a touch of extra gloss on the sauce look this stuff is pretty spicy but it does mellow out with the vinegar and the sugar and the butter but if you want it less spicy you could just add less habaneros if you're a little baby now all you got to do is second fry your wings until sensuous and toss them in a bowl coat in that sauce good lord look at that sauce just giving us the drip now give that a nice little toss to coat thoroughly dump on a plate and look no need to garnish these because they look so beautifully special on their own and the smell of the tropics fuming through the airs and a firecracked spice on the back of the nose now next but not least is our parmesan garlic or in our case parmigiano aliosos probably not the greatest translation this is the easiest of the three because most of it is done in a blender so you guessed it snag a blender add in eight cloves of garlic two tablespoons of dijon mustard one tablespoon of corn syrup optional but helps with the glossiness one and a half teaspoons of fresh thyme leaves the juice of two lemons one cup of finely grated parmigiano-reggiano two egg yolks then begin blending that on low speed and gradually work your way up to high then once everything in the blender is smooth and pureed slowly stream in one cup of canola oil while blending constantly until all the oil is added in the sauce is emulsified and creamy then just pour that out into a bowl and to that you're gonna add one red fresno chili bruno cut which is just a very fine dice one small shallot also bruno cut salt and fresh cracked black pepper to taste two teaspoons of rosemary finely chopped two tablespoons of fresh parsley also finely chopped then mix that together and that's your parmigiano wang sauce and just like all the others fry your wings toss in a bowl coat with your parmigiano sauce and salt to taste hit the wings with some extra lemon juice toss to coat thoroughly place in a serving bowl or tray then optionally top that with some thinly sliced chives an additional freshly grated parmigiano-reggiano or grana padano and those are some luxurious wings that look nearly angelic singing ancient cheese hems from a mountain top so we've got our three sauces all lined up in all their powerful glory quiffy wings coated in the most beautiful and cared-for sauces versus the same lineup of sauces from buffalo wild wings it's time to determine a true winner so let us taste test wow we made it first off these mango habanero wings look far more mango habanero than these let's get in the show right here these are perfect in the world of mango habanero what do i think i think flowers and tropical fruit everywhere and this bongos and that's not the right instrument that's what i feel when i'm eating these wings tropical sweet little bit of heat right now a little pop in the pants but that's all right i could recover from that we already know this is gonna be a winner just look at this if flavor had a definition it's just this color on chicken i want to like take this to the back room there's not as many flavors that i would describe as beautiful sensational sensual that's that last one parmesan garlic we won it does not have a caesar salad taste so before anyone's like josh that's basically a caesar shut up there's no anchovy it's not a caesar it's an emulsified parmesan garlic sauce and it is busting all in all this is a win but we need a taste tester vikram's back yeah i mean you you like wings of any variety really wings this is the asian zing number one number two all right that's number one got some chew got some flavors going on okay he didn't even swallow all right this one's clear buy a long shot this just like punches this one in like out of this dimension number one two good job he likes it he likes positive affirmation he's a words of affirmation love language kind of guy you know you should let us know in the comments say something nice about vikram this doesn't even taste like cheese i can't get garlic or parmesan it's just like it's clearly there's a sauce but there's nothing really ah okay so we got two out of three wing number one and wing number two yeah this one spice is just like i still feel it it's still in my mouth this one's so much deeper i love mangoes i love spicy stuff this is just such a perfect mix you want on all fronts i don't think i'm ever going to buffalo wild wings again you want to know what else has papa's piping hot crispy wangs coated in any sauce your heart desires b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our buffalo wild wings three different sauces we cooked the wings to utter perfection we cured them cured them of their ailment of being awful see how i kind of did that we literally did cure them though by leaving them in the salt which kind of tenderizes them makes the skin crispier it removes the excess moisture so you get crisp er skin all in all every single sauce i think was totally knocked out of the park i even went back and ate some more wings with more sauce i want those sauces bottled in my mouth who knows maybe we'll bottle them and sell them until then if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you around the corner with the chicken wing [Music] you
153,153,The Cheesiest Baked Pasta Ever (Baked Ziti 2 Ways),https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lYrI6jbU6yU/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBaIGzbNFHh3SdqzRAI0RecBL_kmQ,lYrI6jbU6yU,"12 minutes, 11 seconds","Ah yes, lasagna's cousin... or well not really but this is a much easier, arguably cheesier, casserole style pasta dish that is full of well... lots of cheese, rich meaty tomato sauce, and...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, so we all know lasagna but it requires a lot more work you get to layer it and do all this and that but there's an easier version out there that i would argue could contest it and you can use any noodle you want or well it should be ziti but you get the point [Music] big ziti and i go way back my mom used to make it for me all the time it was sort of one of those things you flip-flop between penne and ziti but as i've kind of grown older i've realized you gotta use ziti because that's the name otherwise it's just baked penne that doesn't sound right well i baked my penne the point is it's very simple you don't have to have a bunch of crazy long noodles you can use a very basic noodle very basic sauce put it in a pan with cheese put it in the oven and that's it but you think we're just gonna stop there no we're gonna make the traditional most known common version there is and then we're gonna amp it up and make it as fancy and uh jw if you will so with that said let's make this shall we we have two versions for you typical big ziti and our fancy cuatro formaggio version let's begin with mystery easy in a medium pot or a dutch oven this is a five quart add just a thin layer of vegetable oil to coat the bottom about two tablespoons heat that over medium heat until it's hot hot then add in 1 pound or 450 grams of italian sausage and half a pound or 225 grams of ground both let that sear for two to three minutes then flip and sear on the other side till you get some nice browning then using a potato masher mash that brother up you know this is a classic papa meat mashing technique that sounded better when i wrote it then let that cook over medium high heat until the fat begins to render out and you get some nice quick bits in the meat remove that from the pot and place to the side then add three tablespoons or 40 milliliters of olive oil to the pot then add one sweet onion that's been diced season that to taste with salt saute your little me in for about three minutes or just until softened then add four cloves of finely chopped garlic saute that for 20 seconds that's 20 seconds you go to 23 seconds and it's ruined good job that's a joke anyway add your meat back stir together then add one and a half 24 ounce cans of crushed tomatoes serve it together and let that simmer for five minutes or until slightly reduced then season that with a small pinch of sugar now while the sugar is optional it does help curb some of that tomato acidity yeah you like that little bit of food science for you right so the sauce is done separately get a pot of water season it generously with salt and please i'm begging you stop with the unsalted pasta water it's depressing the water needs to be heavily salted think salty like the ocean you know once that's boiling and nice add in one pound or 450 grams of dried ziti pasta yes i know it's store-bought but that's the point of this first version i'm joking there's nothing wrong with dried pasta okay relax cook that until just under al dente so knock off like one minute from its recommended cook time then using a spider transfer your pasta to your sauce it's totally fine if you get a little pasta water in there and as a matter of fact it's kind of good because the starch in the water helps thicken into most of our sauce stir your sauce and pasta together until thoroughly incorporated from there let's make our cheese mix basically 14 ounces or 400 grams of fresh mozzarella grated of course you always grate fresh right yet again pre-grated makes papa sad anyway follow that up with four ounces or 113 grams of grated then toss those together and that's the cheese mix get a 9x13 baking dish give it a light spray with non-stick then add in half your pasta and its sauce evenly spread it out then add half of a 15 ounce or 425 gram tub of full fat ricotta i like to do little randomized spoonfuls then follow that with half of your cheese mixture top with the other remaining half of your pasta and its sauce your other half of ricotta spoon on and of course the other half of your cheese now that looks like a got dang casserole if i ever seen one from there all you gotta do is hello papa is here don't be scared are you salting your tomatoes that's not the point the point is you need to buy my book it's available on amazon the link's in the description please go there okay means a lot to me i know you want this you can ask me for it i work really hard on it [Music] you know what to do don't hesitate pop it in the oven set to 375 fahrenheit for 35 minutes or until all the cheese is melted and bubbling and you've got some nice cheese browning now pull that out let your sweet child cool for 15 minutes trust me this thing is hot your mouth and esophagus will thank you for your patience now all there's left to do is hit it with some fresh basil snack a nice big boy spoon and scoop it as much as your heart desires now let's taste test mr traditional first we're back filming after three weeks of not filming at all all thanks to vikram yay vikram got engaged it's so exciting by the time you're seeing this it's actually not that far into the future because now we're almost behind on our uploads we usually film quite a bit ahead how do i eat i forgot how at this whole three weeks i didn't eat any at all okay my childhood is coming back to me there's rose petals falling i'm crying there's there's two babies crying i don't know who the second one is and wait the baby's in a bed but it's made of pasta this this is impossible this is nostalgia at its finest the caramelized cheese it's i mean it's ultra rich but somehow balanced at the same time with the tomato you've got the nicely cooked noodles a little overcooked but you know that's the quality of a casserole it's fine okay maybe undercook it a little more okay it's basically like the easiest lasagna ever and somehow different at the same time by having a freaking ziti some people use penne let me explain something is it baked penne or baked ziti it's baked ziti use ziti please unless you make the pasta by hand in which case we're gonna do that right now okay next is papa's zd which is actually not gonna be with ziti so maybe it's more like papa's yeah which you might guess is only just a tiny tiny tiny oh so my newt touch more involved first step pasta so look of course you can use store-bought but i had to pull out the big guns and grab the good old pasta extruder if you have one great if not the link for this is in the description or you can just observe the beauty of pasta extrusion here today real simple i started with 500 grams of all-purpose flour no salt turn the bad boy on toss in about 190 milliliters of filtered water and well that's actually it the machine does pretty much all the work for you here the attachment on this guy is technically a penne setting but i cut it into longer tube shapes to kind of mimic a cooler fancier ziti if you will you know i don't know i thought it looked nice and organic wow i did do you hear that sound like some sort of hoity-toity art director or something yes the pastor was a little more organically shaped it had character love sensuality to it anyway let that thang keep pushing your pasta cutting pushing and cutting onto a landing pad such as a baking sheet until all of your pasta is extruded dust it with a little extra all-purpose flour give it a gentle toss to coat and that's your pasta now for the sauce get a large saute pan or a medium pot and add 4 ounces or 113 grams of finely and evenly diced guanciale you know starting with a nice knife cut makes a big difference in the final product add a little glug of extra virgin olive oil turn the heat to medium and let that saute stirring occasionally until your guanciale has rendered nearly all of its fat and it's got a beautiful browning over each piece then add one broom wash shallot three cloves of rough chopped garlic fresh cracked black pepper and salt to taste give that a little stir and let that guy sweat stirring occasionally until the veg softens about two minutes then add two half teaspoons of fennel seed powder one and a quarter teaspoon of red pepper flakes stir it together saute till fragrant about 20 seconds then add one six ounce or 170 gram can of good quality tomato paste stir and saute until the tomato paste begins to develop some color about one to two minutes then add half a cup of beef broth then scrape that out transfer into a small bowl then in that same pan we're gonna add our meat but hold on there partner for the meat you're gonna need two pounds or 905 grams of boneless pork shoulder cut into thin strips half a pound or 225 grams of boneless beef short ribs also cut into strips and a quarter pound or 113 grams of prosciutto rough chopped it's also that together in a bowl and here we go josh being extra again pass through meat grinder until all of it is ground together and you have a beautiful little meaty man oh so meaty then take that mixture knead it together add it to your pan sear the same as before flatten it out for three minutes flip and sear on the other side then using a potato masher well mash it up but this time once you have your crumble we're gonna let it render out its fat even more really let it fry in that fat so you get nice little brown crispy bits that are almost like little meaty jewels scattered across the pan from there add your guanciale tomato paste back to the pan followed by a 24 ounce can of crushed tomatoes give that a stir then add one tablespoon of fresh chopped rosemary stir that together season your taste with salt and simmer for two to five minutes or until lightly reduced and that's your sauce trust me this this thing be thank you then just like before salty boiling water add in your pasta and now since this stuff is fresh you're only gonna need to cook it for about 45 seconds then immediately spider that out of the pot and into the sauce fold that together and that's your pasta with a little bit of sauce mixed together now for the cheese mixture let's first look at the ricotta fold in a small handful of basil that's been chiffonade cut now on a medium bowl add 12 ounces or 340 grams of grated scamorza cheese yeah see that sounds fancy doesn't it look mozzarella is a fine alternative but this is the good stuff followed by three ounces or 85 grams of grana padano cheese not to be confused with parmigiano okay it's different then 3 ounces or 85 grams of pecorino romano cheese toss all those together and that's your cheesy mixture all right it's layering time get your greased nine by 13 pan add in half your pasta and its sauce then half your ricotta mixture dotted all over half of your cheese mixture the other half of your pasta the other half of your ricotta and finally the other half of your cheese then the same thing pop that into an oven set to 375 for 35 to 40 minutes or until browned and boopling and that's your big fancy man zebe now scoop that brother out shed a tear for the cheese pole hit your serving with some chiffonade basil and let us decide if mr traditional can engage in hand-to-hand combat against papa's zd oh i kept the plate in the oven to keep it warm and that is the second time today that i've done that not keep it warm i meant burn myself okay we got our homemade pasta extruded pasta um technically it was called a penne attachment didn't quite look like penne and so i thought well maybe if i make them sort of more straight not the best extruder not gonna lie this is the fancy one ingredients are different [Music] oh god there wasn't supposed to be a winner which is better or not it was more like fancy non-fancy but instantaneously easily this is accidentally the winner there's depth of flavor it's not just like oh a little marinara sausage tomato and kind of a little faint garlic i think somewhere in there in like 4 000 miles away this it's like every single bite the different cheeses it's a cuatro famarzio combined with the fresh ground meat i mean we really we really went all out with this we might as well just made our own cheese and became a dairy farmer you know in like wisconsin anyway this one's really good bikram i think you should taste these two and tell me which one is your favorite yeah instantly easy they're both good by all means but this is like if you gave me 50 pounds of this i would eat it all yeah you want to know what else has papa's noodles being pushed out and cut off wow that's visceral b-roll all right guys and that is it so we made our big cd two different ways the original version or well the more commonly known version and then of course a fancier version pretty good right italians can we get a rating i would give that a three zds out of olive oil whether you choose the fancy version or the normal version it's really not that much more i guess it is more difficult well that's the way it usually goes around

Get My Cookbook:...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, you know i don't think we do enough snack foods i'm about better i'll be honest this is one of those items that are never approached and ironically i have a feeling it's gonna be pretty easy [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today we're making oreos but better this is a pretty simple recipe it's two cookies with cream in the middle sandwich together and you eat it it could not be simpler at least from my understanding maybe it's gonna be really difficult i honestly don't know how this one's gonna turn out so is there really much to describe do you not know what an oreo is dude point is we're gonna make this i don't know what's gonna happen so let's put our best foot forward now with all that said let's make this shall we we're back at walmart we've parked and it's time to go get oreos you know i really like oreos for the record that wasn't so bad except i forgot my card and so vikram had the need for me yay thank you vikram for the charity donation all right so we've got we're not gonna make the same mistake that i made with the graham crackers all right i know everyone was like josh you broke the graham crackers i was just being a little too violent with them all right it's not my fault they're weak so anyway we have these oreos [Applause] let me just point out really quick that i actually do really like oreos why are these not as good as i remember oh it's cause these aren't double stuffed we should have got the devil stuffed with them not being double stuffed they're just dry crackers i want the cream there's not enough cream in this so if we're judging it off of that i'm gonna say these aren't that good but if they're double stuffed they're so we'll just pretend these are oh wait we can make them double stuffed yeah you know it's the cream it's the cream you want it's the perfect balance long story short i like oreos they're not that bad they taste good i could eat a bunch of them they're one of those things where you just when you sit down and eat them for some reason you just eat either half of the whole darn thing can we recreate them i don't know but we're going to lead with our best foot forward and see how far we can get right out so i wanted to make this as easy as possible for everyone don't start roast me in the comments oh josh always says it's easy but then it's aging and smoking and curing and singing to it in 13 mystical tongues well this really is the easiest way i've found so let's start by making our salted butter chocolate cookie dough first in a medium sized bowl add one and a half cups or 225 grams of all-purpose flour half a cup or 50 grams of cocoa powder half a teaspoon or 4 grams of fine sea salt 1 teaspoon or 4 grams of baking soda and half a teaspoon or 2 grams of baking powder give that a nice [Music] and that is your dry mix next in a separate large bowl add half a cup or 115 grams of unsalted butter that of course has been softened then using a handheld electric mixer begin beating the butter on high speed then little by little add in half a cup or 105 grams of granulated sugar letting it incorporate between each batch until all of your sugar is added then repeat the same gradual sugar addition with half a cup or 115 grams of light brown sugar which by the way why aren't there more recipe writers out there specifying lighter dark brown have you noticed that recipe writers wake up enough is enough papa specify because papa now once you're bill and sugar is creamed beat in one whole egg until thoroughly incorporated followed by two teaspoons or five grams of vanilla extract and one tablespoon or thirteen grams of whole milk beat until beautifully queeny then to your cream butter add in your dry mix and fold together until it completely combined and you get a nice thick dough then just line a baking sheet with parchment or silicone baking mat and using a small cookie scoop about one and a half tablespoons or so scoop your cookie dough out in rows of three to fit 12 total cookies per sheet you'll likely get around 24 cookies total then just roll all those into nice round glistening balls and from there you can press them however you like obviously a cookie press would be better but i promised you easy so the bottom of a grease cup works just fine but they do sometimes stick little which is extremely annoying and once all of your cookies are pressed optionally if you happen to have a brand of your initials lying around your kitchen don't ask me why i do then go ahead and gently press an indentation of your initials you know for the full flex then pop those bad boys into an oven that's been preheated to 350 fahrenheit and bake those brothers for seven to ten minutes then pull them out and let them rest on their sheets for two to three more minutes then transfer to cool the rest of the way on a wire rack now look they're not perfect looking they're a little bit more artisanal which is a great way to say i should have used a cookie press but it's fine last but not least is a clem which to me is more like a very thick frosting so to make that start with three tablespoons or four grams of softened salted butter not unsalted with your handheld electric mixer beat that thing till smooth then beat in 3 ounces or 85 grams of room temperature softened full fat cream cheese stop using low fat cream cheese please just throw it out the window until everything is thoroughly combined and creamy then add in two and a half cups or 350 grams of powdered sugar i actually like to start beating in half that amount beat until combined then at the other half and beat that the rest of the way just makes a little easier but hey do whatever you want some people like to make their lives more difficult anyway once that's thoroughly combined it'll be a little bit glowy so next you'll add half a teaspoon or one gram of vanilla extract beat that in then just add in an additional teaspoon of milk if needed beat it in and you should get a consistency something like this oh and you can totally add vanilla beans to this if you want but that's up to you then just take your clem and place it in your pastry condo i mean piping bag with a round tip attachment and now it's assembly time which is extremely simple first start off with one of your cookies flat side up pipe it up with about one and a half to two and a half tablespoons of creme right in the center of your cookie then place the top another cookie flat side down and gently press together to distribute the creme and that's it you can store these in an airtight container or enjoy now but more importantly we need to see how close we got to the oreo because not gonna lie they're looking a little different so surely there must be a true winner here let's find out jay hold on w fully custom somebody uh dm'd me and they were like oh josh uh what's the jw stand for hello my god go read a book matter of fact read my book the link is in the description josh weissman's book oh my god it's out you can pre-order it now and you should pre-order it please all right enough talk let's commence now i can already tell that mine are more of a softer cookie so that could be a problem all right here we go oh mama okay this requires a different kind of analysis than we've had before first off flavor-wise instantaneous win without a doubt i have nothing to say other than that but they're not exactly the same technically nothing we make on butt better is even close to the original one because it's so astronomically better but the cookie's a little bit softer it's got crunch and then chew this on the other hand just more of a you know crumbly cookie like a cracker almost it still has an oreo flavor to it though almost welcome a new member kendrick please join us on the stage and by stage i mean this really small corner of the kitchen so number one are we ready drumroll please don't actually do a drum roll that will ruin the audio vic or my sword god taste test numero uno commences now kendrick this is a very intimate moment for the both of us and i'm really enjoying it that's like more creamy than i thought it was going to be you see there's like almost no point in the blind version which one's this is the first one for me so the one that you have i do like the softer cookie and just like the excessive amount of cream i think your cream is sweeter than oreos cream i completely agree with that i feel like situationally i might choose the oreo because like i was saying earlier this has more flavor but you're only eating one of these you're going to eat 20 of these this almost is not an oreo yeah this is its own dessert this is like a cream sandwich this is just not an oreo but if we're talking about enjoyment you came to the right place brother i think we should leave the rest of the audience anyone who's watching this if you have an opinion about it leave it in the comments let us know how did we do did we did we do it did we you say anything else i'll beat your ass you want to know what else has cookies filled with copious amounts of papas creme beer all right guys and that is it so we made our oreos from scratch at home using [Music] and well you know what what we ended up making was very good as we stated before eating experience wise they are better than an oreo but is it truly an oreo i don't know i think if the cookie was crunchier it would have been more oreo-esque that was the biggest mistake we made today but had it been crunchier i still think it would have been better because the flavor was there so the point still stands it was more of like a sort of like a crunchy whoopie pie if i would describe it nonetheless they're very easy to make they will make you happy they will make you feel tingly all throughout your body you're sitting and vibrating your chair as you're eating this cream cook if you uh the cookie with the cream what i'm trying to say is if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time you
155,155,The Perfect Egg Recipe (Scotch Eggs 3 Ways),https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hs1ccQFnNZI/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBfdr7ryfx9ITcuaqTJ6lHPo0AuYw,Hs1ccQFnNZI,"9 minutes, 19 seconds",Transform your breakfast with the ultimate fancy egg upgrade! Eggs are one of the most multi-faceted and underrated ingredients in the entire world. These 2 different scotch egg recipes put...,2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, you've probably heard this by now but the egg is probably one of the most multifaceted ingredients in the entire world and yet equally underrated and you know what this recipe should put a little more respect on that name [Music] okay so today we're making scotch eggs now what is that like hopscotch jumping around on jump rope is it like a butterscotch just dipped in butterscotch and then eaten funny right no it's not funny okay scotch eggs are very very important to me this is a serious subject a scotch egg is typically a hard-boiled egg wrapped in sausage then breaded then fried and then enjoyed in sweet bliss as it whispers sweet nothings in your ears but you know what though the hard boil thing not about it why can't it be a soft boiled egg right it's too hard too hard to peel what if it falls apart or what if you just do it properly that's what we're gonna do today so with all that said let's make this shall we look it's real freaking easy bro so with 10 eggs and of those 10 you're gonna remove two which we'll need for later so we're actually only boiling eight of them i don't we're already doing a mathematical equation here it's it's too much lower your eight eggs into a pot of boiling water actually started these at cold and found them to get cooked too much for my liking so definitely start in boiling water instead anyway as soon as they're in the water let those cook for four minutes and 30 seconds exactly then immediately plunge them into ice water and let them cool for at least 10 to 15 minutes then carefully peel those under running water oh josh but why does it have to be running water it's so messy actually no this is less messy and it helps get the shell off without tearing any of the white which for an egg that's this soft cooked you're gonna need all the help you can get brother now once those are peeled let's make our pork spank it a little for being a bad boy start with 2 pounds or 900 grams of ground pork then to that meaty man you're gonna add two teaspoons or four grams of ground black pepper one tablespoon or twelve grams of kosher salt half a teaspoon or one gram of cayenne powder one small pinch of ground allspice one tablespoon or fifteen grams of packed light brown sugar one tablespoon or twelve grams of dijon mustard 2 teaspoons or 10 grams of worcestershire sauce at this point i'm just saying worcestershire sauce incorrectly alright i know how to say it two and a half tablespoons or seven grams of finely chopped sage leaves a quarter cup or 15 grams of finely chopped parsley mix all that together until it's combined then knead your meat yeah just like dough for one to two minutes or until you get a nice tacky meaty mixture nice be sure to break off a little piece and form it into a small patty to sear and cook through just to taste and adjust any salt levels if needed then divide your meat into eight evenly sized balls and as per usual if you want them super even then weigh all the meat and grams divide that by eight and use that amount in grams per ball of meat see what i'm saying efficiency now roll all your balls and place to the side now for wrapping your huevos in your meaty balls it'll look something like this lay down a sheet of plastic wrap and place your ball right in the center press it out with your hands until you get a circle about two and a half times the size of your egg and it's a little under half an inch thick take one of your eggs gently toss in plain all-purpose flour shake off the excess then place it in the center of the meat disc then using your plastic wrap gather up the sides cover the entire egg gently squeeze the edges shut and at that point i like to remove it from the plastic wrap and seal the rest of it by hand so that it is completely encased in the meat no holes in your balls if you have any holes for one it's gonna ruin your egg and for two you know what you know what papa will do and that's your wrapped little man just look at him don't you just want to sing to him oh my little meat wrapped eggman anyway repeat with the rest of your eggs now the breading station is simple we have one bowl with panko bread crumbs in it another with all-purpose flour that's been seasoned lightly with salt and pepper and then a third with the remaining two eggs cracked into it along with a splash of water whisked together till evenly incorporated and homogenized now here's how to use that station first toss one of your balls gently in the flour to coat the whole thing no flourless spots we've had this conversation before papa no hug or kiss gently shake off the excess then toss to cook completely in the egg wash and finally into the panko breadcrumbs to coat completely hang on brother you think we're done here give that one more coat back into the egg mixture and one last time into the breadcrumbs to give it a double coat of panko again no wet spots and remember what i said about wet spots we don't want any in the bed and so we don't want any on our scotch eggs now all you gotta do is lower those bad boys about two to three at a time into frying oil that's around 350 degrees fahrenheit for a grand total of five to seven minutes or until a beautifully golden brown egg emerges from the oil shimmering in all of its glory place it on a wire rack to drain and repeat with the rest of your eggs i mean look at these some something about them this perfectly beautiful oval shape just looks magical you almost want to see what the inside looks like so let's get a knife and cut this open to see how we did and as you can see it appears that this thing is about to bust in the most glorious egg yolk split we've ever seen on this channel so far so with that it's time that we say goodbye to powdery overcooked scotch eggs and hello to the eggy taste test of the century yo it's my ball beautifully crusted okay that could be an instrument let us commence splendid right off the bat this is perfect and it's a whole meal on its own you have the crunch in the crust the starch you got the protein the fat and last of all you have well more protein and fat which is the egg so where's the vegetables not really there and just how we like it on this show no vegetables the point is this is a perfect meal on its own but you could take it much farther by putting it on something a sandwich you could put it over rice and throw on some some glaze this recipe is so shockingly easy we're already done with it so i figured i'd show you a couple of quick ways you can utilize this what else can we do with the scotch egg josh please do tell well you could do whatever you want with it or better you get some toast arrange some avocado nicely on there maybe hit it with some lemon juice flaky salt then follow that up with a beautiful massive half of your scotch egg some fresh herbs fresh cracked black pepper and whatever else you want for an avocado toast that will surely cost probably about 30 anywhere you go now another option would be my personal favorite which is sort of like a son-in-law inspired version where you essentially will lay it split open in all of its flowing yolk beauty place it atop some beautifully steamed rice then hit the rice with some thinly sliced green onion toasted sesame seeds a nice glug or two of your favorite soy sauce this is just dark soy sauce and a generous handful of bonito flakes to finish it all off it's simple but beautiful now as simple as these other options seem let's see if they work with a heaping sausage-wrapped fried egg oozing on top of it we have two different versions completely different avocado toast so think california valley girl and rice bowl with a crisp egg now this is sort of an iteration of son-in-law vibe oh yeah this is a very good idea top 100 right here anytime you go starch on starch you think oh it has to be too much it never rinses yet the richness from the avocado the crunch from the actual toast and an additional sort of like quippity crunch of the scotch egg you got that runny yolk sort of bleeding through so you've got the you know runny yolk avocado toast we all know that this additional layer of sausage and crispy crust is the answer to your prayers toast people okay are you a toast person and you're not putting a scotch egg bro wake up anyway that's my two cents so onward to this before i eat this should always have some form of soy to season it with this is a sweet soy i'll give this a little extra drizzle because i feel like you could use a touch more just stains everything so beautifully oh my god got the yolk on the rice some sesame seeds some soy where has this been all my life i was wrong about this this is nothing [Music] i can't go any farther otherwise that's that copyrighted song will give me a strike so monetization all right this is far beyond what i had anticipated i could very easily eat two three bowls of this this is everything i could have ever wanted in a scotch so a uk british scottish combined with japanese cuisine can it be done it has been the possibilities are limitless choose your own adventure you want to know what else has papa's deep fried huevos on camera b-roll all right guys and that is it so we made our scotch eggs beautiful yolk when we split it it was like [Music] it was busting that was the juiciest yolk shot i think we've ever gotten on this channel it was within the confines of a deep fried egg the pork was beautifully juicy i mean it was juicing the outside was crisp crunchy it had a nice layer not too thick not too thin just right you got to try this if you've never had it before because it's one of those foods that's kind of got a fair food vibe to it also has some level of elegance to it it looks mysterious it's like how did he do that is this some sort of egg sausage magician hello yes it's me anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned

want to see if we can get it to that price and i think that we can but there's a couple things we need to do we need to leverage flavor and technique as usual to make the best version of a cheap burrito that we can and yes we're making our own tortillas obviously why would we not have we ever not made our own tortillas don't answer that question stop smiling vicar don't answer the question now with all that said let's make this shall we right out so the most important components for proper burrito is well actually everything so to maximize each while keeping the price low we're making them all from scratch including the tortillas and they'll be a little pants wearing baby and just make the freaking tortillas you got this okay papa's got you also i'm tired of it no more excuses please allow yourself to experience life now for these tortillas i've made them a few times on here already so here's a quick refresher in a medium sized bowl you're going to add 2 cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour half a teaspoon or 2 grams of baking powder and 1 teaspoon or 4 grams of fine sea salt give that some whiskey [Music] now in a container we have three quarters of a cup 180 milliliters of warm water to that you're gonna add a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of vegetable oil then just pour in your oily water into your flour mixture and mix together as soon as you get a shaggy dough turn it onto a work surface and knead it for about two minutes or until you get a smooth extensible dough wrap that brother in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes to one hour granted it's okay if it goes over a little bit now while your dough is resting we can get the rest of our elements done for the rice you know how papa likes it for this you'll need 1 cup or 200 grams of medium grain rice and guess what wash your got dang rice watch it don't ask any more questions thank you so place it in a colander then into a bowl fill it up with water so the rice is completely submerged agitate the rice till the water is starchy drain and repeat one to two more times place it into a proper rice cooker link in the description along with one cup or 240 milliliters of water close the rice cooker and get it well cooking once it's done you'll then add salt to taste two tablespoons or 30 grams of unsalted butter give that a stir until the butter is completely melted and thoroughly coats all the rice then add a quarter cup or 15 grams of finely chopped cilantro in the juice of one lime then just give that a nice stir until everything is combined adjust the salt levels and that is your rice next let's talk chicky get 2 pounds or 900 grams of boneless skinless chicken thighs place those into a bowl then add 2 tablespoons or 28 grams of kosher salt one teaspoon or four grams of onion powder one tablespoon or eight grams of garlic powder two teaspoons or six grams of ground cumin one tablespoon or eight grams of smoked paprika one teaspoon or five grams of fresh ground black pepper fresh ground none of that pre-ground stuff please because if you do papa no geese or hug or anything really and optionally the liquid from half a can of chipotle chilies in adobo really you just want the liquid you know the solids now toss all that together until everything is evenly coated with the spice mixture then in a large skillet over medium-high heat just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan about two tablespoons then once that's add your chicken in batches to avoid overcrowding and just let that sear for two to three minutes give it a flip and you should have a beautifully seared piece of chicken with some light char this is also even better if you can grill it let it sear on the other side for one to two more minutes then place on a small baking sheet guess the interior is still raw just here hang on repeat that with all of your chicken then toss that baking sheet into an oven set to 400 fahrenheit to finish the cooking process for 10 to 15 minutes or till the internal temperature of your chicken is 165 fahrenheit from there cut your chicken into bite size cubes and toss in its own pan drippings for max flavor see you toss it in the juices it already made to add flavor but it doesn't add any cost if that ain't much cheaper i don't know what the heck is now for the beans it's real easy in a medium saucepan add 2 tablespoons or 30 grams of unsalted butter set over medium heat and as soon as the butter is melted in bubble in add one sliced sweet onion some salt and pepper to taste two jalapenos also sliced give that a stir to coat with the butter then just let that cook stirring occasionally until the vegetables begin to soften but aren't total mush then add one can of black beans two tablespoons or 30 milliliters of hot sauce i used tapatio for this season a taste with salt and stir until thoroughly incorporated then continue to cook while stirring often until everything is hot hot then in a separate cold pan add three slices of bacon that have been cut into half inch lardons set that to medium heat and let that cook stirring often until it's rendered its fat and is cooked completely crisp remove the bacon from the fat and trade on a paper towel once drained chop that with a knife until very fine do not wash that pan you just cook the bacon in i'll explain in a little bit anyway add your chopped bacon to your beans what the sorry i watch too much tick tock lastly we need to worry about our vegetables never skip the fajita style veggies so in that same pan we cooked the bacon in all that bacon fat the fond left over oh my lord now first thing in a medium-sized bowl add one red bell pepper thinly sliced one sweet onion thinly sliced and two jalapenos also thinly sliced give that a toss so they're evenly mixed then heat that pan and all the bacon fat in there back up over medium-high and once that's hot oh so hot [Music] add your fajita veggies season your taste with salt and cook tossing occasionally for about three to five minutes or until lightly charred and just beginning to soften but like i said it needs to have some body to it we're not making baby food we're making fajita veggies turn off the heat and add two cloves of garlic that have been very finely chopped tossed together season your taste with salt toss together again and those are your garlicky fajita veggies back to the tortillas begin heating a dry large cast iron skillet or a comal if you have one over medium high until very very hot divide your dough into six to eight pieces depending on how large you want your tortillas gently roll each piece into a rough ball generously flour one of your balls and press firmly down with your palm till you get a disc begin rolling that until you get a disc it's a little thinner than a quarter of an inch and it's about well a burrito-sized tortilla gently lay that into your very hot pan let it cook for 15 to 30 seconds or till it starts to get some light char and bubbles flip and cook for another 20 to 30 seconds or until the other side gets some char and inflates nicely take it off place it on a plate tempted with plastic wrap and repeat with all of your pieces of dough alright we're pretty much ready for assembly right wrong bro can't forget about the aioli add one cup or 220 grams of mayonnaise one tablespoon or eight grams of smoked paprika two tablespoons or 30 milliliters of hot sauce two tablespoons or 30 milliliters of lime juice three cloves of garlic grated and salt to taste whisk that together until thoroughly combined and lovely for max efficiency place that in a squirt bottle it is time to assemble start off with your most beautiful tortilla lay down a nice bed of rice your hot beans a generous layer of your chicken a fatty drizzle of your foe aioli a nice layer of your fajita vegetables and optionally a nice little garden of fresh cilantro leaves oh and of course a generous grating of cheddar cheese should your heart desire it and you don't get vardy after eating it and look burrito rolling is simple grab the sides bring them towards the center then grab the bottom and roll that over the filling and over your folded insides nice and tight all the way up until you have a beautifully symmetrical cylinder kind of like the ones that they suck up in a tube at the post office now marveling at papa's fat tube i think we need to get a cross section first to make sure this is good looking and lord have mercy forgive me for on this day i'm about to bust and all that for this price right here per burrito now let's taste test to see if the flavor is at least worth that amount of money it's burrito time and this came out to a grand total of this much dollars per burrito pretty good for a burrito that looks this good i want to just put it in both ends wait no so hang on rewind i want to put it in my mouth this is so perfectly seasoned sauce and flavor you don't even need a salsa or hot sauce you just eat this by itself on the couch while you slowly drift away into a beautiful nap right you're napping about this burrito you're dreaming about it sleeping on it sleeping with it this is actually

Additional Cookbook Options...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, i'm getting sick of seeing the same chicken recipe over and over chicken breast this chicken breast put it on the grill no okay enough is enough this is a very common filipino food that in my opinion is one of the greatest chicken dishes of all time [Music] okay so today we're making the classic chicken adobo greatest chicken dish of all time well hang on there's a lot of actually really good chicken dishes that i like i get really excited about adobo because i'm a big fan of it it's tender it's rich it's salty it's sweet it's acidic it's everything you want and it's beautiful on a plate of rice or you could use it for anything it's so multifaceted why doesn't everyone make this i want more people making it properly so with all that said let's make this shall we okay this is quite possibly one of the easiest most flavor packed chicken dishes of all time so let's not waste any time in a large bowl add four chicken drumsticks and four bone in and skin on chicken thighs that's right bone in not bone less to that you're gonna add 20 cloves of garlic that have been heavily crushed yes 20 cloves for all the people that are like oh yes whenever i see a recipe that says two cloves it means four to me how about this karen huh for real though garlic is probably one of the most important things in my life so yes add a small fresh crack of black pepper then one tablespoon or seven grams of whole black peppercorns three tablespoons or 50 grams of palm sugar the good stuff will come in pucks like this which i highly recommend and you can break those down by finely chopping with a knife or grating with a grater place that in your bowl then add one and a quarter cup or 300 milliliters of unseasoned rice vinegar a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of dark soy sauce half a cup 120 milliliters of regular soy sauce ideally the silver swan brand link a description for that half a cup or 120 milliliters of filtered water toss that nicely and finally four bay leaves then just cover that bad boy with plastic wrap and marinate in the fridge for two hours but ideally overnight and look for the record you can skip the marination completely and it's still delicious but of course still recommends overnight marination thank you once that's done be sure to reserve all of your marinating liquid then get a large braiser or dutch oven heat that over medium-high with enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan then sear all of your chicken pieces in batches on all sides for two to three minutes per side to get some nice browning on all that beautiful skin and meat then brown the rest of it please do that in batches placing each batch to the side after browning to avoid any overcrowding papa no kiss a chicken on top of chicken while searing once all of your chicken is seared and out of the pan add your marination liquid along with all of its aromatics literally just dump all of it out increase the heat to medium-high then arrange all of your chicken snugly in one layer in your cooking apparatus then bring that to a boil and as soon as it reaches that boil immediately reduce too low reduce to a simmer cover with a lid and cook for 35 minutes then uncover that bad boy carefully turn your chicken pieces cover again and cook for 25 to 35 more minutes this time turning your chicken pieces occasionally to coat thoroughly during that process until your chicken is beautifully tender and the liquid thickens to a stunning glaze i mean look at this thing just bubbling away something about it touches deep within the reaches of human carnal desire the exposed bone the amber luxurious sauce the aromatics caramelizing away it's just sexy from there you can hit that with some fresh green onion and plop that whole thing on a table with some rice to the side or you can plate it up like so a nice mound of rice followed by one to two pieces of chicken per person then spoon on as much or as little of the sauce on top i like to get nasty with it i like a lot of that incredible sauce get ready to absolutely boss uh okay so before we even start vikram said there's a two percent chance that i would actually catch this correctly in my hand like this so and my hands are greasy and covered in chicken fats so let's see if that's true [Music] ah let's just get a round of applause chicken adobo which is absolutely solid i got a text message from one of my very good friends dan the man he's watching he is from the philippines he knows this cuisine and i feel he felt that i did it justice today so if you don't feel that i did it justice day i don't care because my friend said i did a good job shut the up first step in checking if it's right you just need a spoon to simply oh my god that is suck perfectly cooked it falls apart it's rich you've got that deep dark soy flavor the acidity from the rice vinegar everything comes together it's rich but also balanced at the same time this is everything that i know about adobo and it's so simple why isn't everyone making this wake up america and the rest of the world that's not the philippines which is there's a lot of that we go and then obviously the rice gets stained with that sauce and it's busting so now that this is done it's messy it's delicious but what if you have leftovers what are you gonna do with that did somebody say unbelievably crisp chicken adobo pot stickers oh ah i did that's right so to make that get a medium sized bowl and add a quarter of a head of green cabbage very thinly sliced salt that lightly and crush with your hands aggressively to soften it up then add three thinly sliced green onions toss together then just get any leftover chicken you have take it off the bone and shred it down with the skin and everything as finely as possible drizzle in some of your glaze to taste assuming you saved it right you didn't throw it away right anyway mix all that together beautifully and that's your filling now just get some gyoza wrappers you can make them yourself or you can buy them that's gonna be up to you this time bud fill that with your desired filling about two teaspoons or so wet the edges fold it like a taco and pinch in the center then pleat only one side of each end starting from the center pleat move the finger down pleat again and then one more time for three total pleats then repeat that on the other side of the midpoint press everything together and look at that it takes some practice but once you get it it's actually really not that hard at all just don't get all nervous and sweaty because well then you're nervous and sweaty and that sucks but the dough will also stick to your clammy stressed hands don't worry papa's got you then repeat that process until you've used all your filling now if you had half of your original adobo recipe left over this will make about 14 to 20 gyoza now all you gotta do is heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat add just enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan lightly about 2 tablespoons then once that's hot arrange your gyoza all the way around the pan so they don't touch but they all fit nice and snug and let those cook in brown for about 2 minutes or until the underside is crisp and beautifully browned like this then very quickly add a quarter cup of water to the pan immediately close the lid and let that steam for three minutes then remove the lid and if there's any liquid left let that simmer till completely gone let the gyoza rest for about one minute then carefully remove them from your pan and arrange on a plate crisp side up and optionally but highly recommended you can absolutely drench these bad boys in your favorite [Music] which of course should be my recipe and the link for that is in the description i also used the glaze from the chicken adobo plus a little splash of extra vinegar as a dipping sauce now all we gotta do is hop aboard the train the flavor we have gyoza combining two different cultures here all right gyoza and adobo chicken ah next to it we have just some of the reduced braising liquid from the adobo cover this in chili oil it's a beautiful thing it's fragrant listen this hear that oh my god [Music] shut up i want to take this into the bedroom with me is that enough for you this is ridiculous somebody get over here it's over it's over every time we combine stuff i feel like we start to make real real waves i almost gagged on that i wish i had more of a gag reflection on that i'll leave somehow this is so good it feels like a butt better now is the time this is your call to action make the freaking chicken and with the leftovers you better be making this also go to the description and buy my book i want you to do that and then i want you to make this that was a shameless plug and now i'm gonna go shamelessly plug myself you wanna know what else has hot chicken legs glistening in the sun b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our chicken adobo beautifully fallen off the bone it melted in your mouth that skin was rich with flavor even the skin of the chicken is good a lot of people like oh god it's rubbery no stop it eat the freaking skin when it's cooked nice and slow like that all right it's like a nice little thin pad of butter that just melts away on your tongue but it's full of that rich mommy soy go out there and try this stuff it is truly a magical thing and i would love for you to experience it now with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you

Today, we're going after the furniture store....yes, the furniture store. Why does IKEA make meatballs? Have no idea, but...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, we've gone after the fast food places the snacks and even the movie theaters but today we're gonna go to the furniture store for some reason [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so sorry am i interrupting the recipe my apologies pre-ordered the book link is in the description thank you okay so today we're making ikea's coveted swedish meatballs i can't believe i'm saying that why does this exist it's just one of those weird things that we all just accept and don't think wait a minute why is this furniture store selling me meatballs like nobody's business it just shouldn't be our business whose business is this really i'm kind of confused what kind of a business is this what who who are you the point is these meatballs have quite the clout and you know ikea's balls and my balls i think need to come together and really duke it out and so that's what we're going to do there's nothing else to say after that so let's make this shall we why is it always packed can we just have one day where ikea is just here you know you don't have to come to ikea you don't have to you can just stay at home like you're supposed to okay so we're back from ikea we got it to go tin it's all still warm because it's right across well not right across the street but it's nearby us you ever heard a meatball make this noise let me answer that for you no there's a fish aroma coming from this not sure how that's possible but hey anything's possible on butt better well i have jam on my fork so let's try that first i mean it's not bad it's just not good bitter imbalanced i just read sugar but the lincoln berries taste kind of good mashed potatoes first truck i've had instant mashed potatoes that are better than this meatballs now i do like these so hopefully they are good today this is not good these are coveted because they come from a furniture store okay that's what we're judging right now can we make them better my god i sure hope so all right folks we have a couple basic components here the meatballs and their coveted gravy are mashed titers broccoli but you know actually exciting and a beautiful lingonberry or well in this case cranberry jam i know a lot of people are going to complain oh josh it needs to be lingenberry you know what look if you can't find lincoln berries do me a favor and don't let those you know what berries tell you that you can't use cranberries are they the same no but they taste close and they contribute the same purpose to the dish now that i've made a few people angry let's start with that in a medium-sized sauce pot add 12 ounces or 350 grams of lingonberries or cranberries they can be fresh or frozen both will work then add one and a quarter cup or 250 grams of granulated white sugar half a cup or 120 milliliters of orange juice half a cup or 120 milliliters of water 2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters of lemon juice and three large strips of orange zest peel it off there's no need to grate it give that a stir and set the temp to medium high let that come to a boil then reduce it to low and simmer for 20 minutes stirring and mashing occasionally until it's thickened into a light syrup and all the berries have boost open then just remove the orange zest or leave it in it's up to you then toss it in a food processor or blender and blend until completely smooth then finally pass it through a fine mesh trainer and cool completely to room temperature i mean just look at that beautifully silky and smooth jam that i want in and around my mouth okay next is our mashed potatoes real easy get yourself three large russet potatoes or more depending on how many you want peel them cut them into chunks god that's a terrible word for anything you're gonna eat chunked anyway toss in a pot and fill with water place it over medium high heat until it comes to a boil and let that cook until fork tender then press them through a potato ricer link in bile for dad separately in a small saucepan add six tablespoons of unsalted butter and one cup of whole milk heat that over medium heat just until hot and the butter is pour three quarters of that over your rice tigers stir that together and if it's still pretty thick feel free to add the rest of the liquid then just season that bad boy to taste with salt and pepper stir till completely smooth and of course add extra butter if you're feeling a little extra nutty mmm nutty little potato man wants his sweet cream butter now just keep that bad boy warm and to the side next let's talk broccoli please there's a time and a place for steaming and boiling and plain broccoli is simply not one of them instead what i'd recommend is breaking your broccoli down into florets i like my florets tall so i leave quite a bit of stem on there then coat a medium sized pan with enough oil to coat the bottom then heat that over medium-high heat and once that's ripping hot add in your broccoli cut sides down season that to taste with salt and let that sear for 2-3 minutes per side until you get a beautiful caramelization and a nice crust on most edges remember we don't want this mush we want it with a little bit of snap once that's done hit it with some fresh lemon juice to taste an additional salt if needed and that's your broccoli now for our most important contender the meatballs so start with one pound or 450 grams of ground beef it's about 80 percent lean three quarters of a pound or 350 grams of ground pork also ideally around that 70 to 80 percent lean marker give your meat a nice massage and mix together thoroughly maybe get a bigger bowl so you have actual room always with the wrong bowls and losing the lids to the pots with me papa very sorry knead that together until it starts to get a little tacky and sticky then add one finely diced or grated sweet onion three cloves of garlic minced two teaspoons or four grams of ground white pepper half a teaspoon or one gram of fresh grated nutmeg a quarter teaspoon of ground allspice half a cup or 55 grams of panko bread crumbs begin mixing that all together and once it's roughly combined add one whole egg mix that together and finally a quarter cup or 60 ml of whole milk mix that thoroughly to combine evenly line it in baking sheet with foil spray the foil with non-stick cooking spray then form the meat into 24 evenly sized balls placing them in rows of four i'd recommend using a medium cookie scoop to get your balls as even as possible then tussles in an oven set to 425 fahrenheit ideally on a convection setting for 15 to 20 minutes or until beautifully browned and cooked through to an internal temp of 165 fahrenheit i mean just look at my balls okay but while those meatballs are still in the oven what in tarnation are you doing twiddling your thumbs thinking about how vikram is mad cute instead of all that i'd recommend making the gravy during this time in a medium saucepan add 3 tablespoons or 42 grams of unsalted butter heat that over medium high heat until melted and add 3 tablespoons or 28 grams of all-purpose flour whisk that together and let that cook stirring occasionally for about one to two minutes or until it begins to turn a little darker then add two cups or 480 milliliters of hot beef broth please make sure this is the good quality beef broth okay like the homemade stuff the better the broth the better the gravy if it's crap the gravy will be crap see what i'm saying fold it up with two tablespoons or 30 milliliters of double fermented soy sauce then just bring that to a light simmer and reduce for five minutes or until thick then add half a cup 120 milliliters of heavy whipping cream and simmer for two more minutes stirring occasionally and that gravy right there is a true beauty in the world of sauces you can also add a teaspoon or three grams of dijon mustard for a little extra to the sauce okay assembly time get yourself a nice plate offset on one side of the plate add a nice big mound of mashed potato then using the back of a large spoon give it a nice swipe to get a little swoosh you know get a little fancy here with our tigers then add four to eight meatballs per plate i put seven here because well unfortunately it looked better for the video but if i'm being honest here add on your broccoli followed by a lovely quinnell of your cranberry jam to absolutely exhibit its stellar consistency and finally sauce your balls generously with your gravy i mean really just coat them nicely all right as much or as little as you like but put a lot then just finish that with some finely chopped fresh italian parsley and fresh cracked black pepper as usual we slang the visuals in comparison but do our meaty balls and anxious gravy compete with a furniture store god i hope so let's find out just by looking at the quinnell of this jam it's almost like this is like before and after before fdl let's start with the gym i mean instantaneously better it's balanced it's got acidity you see what i'm saying potato they're better thank you for coming by by a lot this is like paper just plain bleached paper and then this is like leonardo da vinci's paintings that sounds a little god complexy that's not what i'm trying to do here i'm just saying this is egregiously better it's not even fair broccoli flavor caramelization is crunchy this did all the talking for me last but not least the balls you ever have the cafeteria food version of something that you like and it destroys how much you like it welcome to the cafeteria i have nothing else to say other than vikram please join us today on today's taste test yay he's back today it's vic from the big man so number one vikram's getting nervous number two the first thing here's one and two vikram likes brock broccoli i won't say either way that's just broccoli it's never just broccoli oh it's not just broccoli vikram doesn't like jam everybody wrote some of the comments hahaha doesn't like jam jam number one it's not it's not too much yucky lucky face jam number two vikram doesn't like jam part seven yours is the second one yeah our final contestant the meat ball number one mmm number two [Applause] there you go this one's yours for sure oh my gosh the light you want on all friends episode 41 butt better swedish meatballs from ikea sweden what's next your move you want to know what else is full of papa's meaty juicy sauced up balls b-roll [Music] [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made the ikea swedish meatballs and they came out perfectly i mean beyond perfectly everything just made sense it actually tasted real feel like there was a point where the meatballs at ikea were really good please no jokes i already know where you're going with that the point is we made them significantly better all the accoutrements on the side all the different sides the mashed potatoes everything you can do that at home very easily and i'm happy to supply that to you so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time if this fly keeps flying in my face he's dead he's dead dead sorry you had to see that goodbye [Music] you

you don't what's wrong with you emma could you please introduce yourself hi everybody i'm emma chamberlain i'm a youtuber and a big fan of josh i told you i wouldn't dance and i just did i know i'm so proud of you thank you vikram you owe me that when i first met emma i felt like we were instantly friends hopefully you felt the same way yes um i was a little bit nervous because i want to cook for at some point but i'm like wait you're vegetarian right that's okay right but on this show i think people they know me more of like i'm the meaty man you are the meaty man it's true so i thought let's do this instead let's come together we're gonna have a little bit of a cook-off but there's a twist gentlemen please oh we're not going to see each other correct what is that what song is that i don't know i just wrote it wait i actually feel so much better that you're not going to see me because like if i cut things weird or whatever like oh the camera will see it oh i know but i don't want you to see it yeah it's funny because i can't see you but i can see your stance what is this i know you've been cooking lately quite a bit as a matter of fact i've been seeing your progress on ig story it's looking good i'm proud of you i really like you that's why you're here right now i think you're gonna do really good but where do you stand on the spectrum of cooking how do you feel about your expertise i'm like not as good as a grandma but like i'm getting there but i'm not like chef level you know what i mean like i'm i'm very much i improvised in the kitchen like a grandma might i'm more of like i'm a home cook you know what i'm saying like when it comes to the technical stuff i'm not i'm not there i cook for mainly me so if i eat my own food i feel good about that today we are making the perfect the ideal vegetarian burger in my mind which is really honestly just a burger using vegetarian meat that's pretty much it you've made a burger before right emma not really what the only thing i think you're gonna struggle with is maybe some of the knife cuts oh great and maybe the assembly but i feel like everything else is gonna fall in line so i don't think there's anything left to say we've gone over everything let's just get our head in the game and make a vegetarian burger i'm so ready honestly this is cute it's my merch swipe up swipe up um they are sold out don't swipe up find a sweet onion it's gonna be pretty big we're gonna make a quick caramelized onion now i was gonna make these beforehand but i forgot so cut that top off and then cut off the bottom how does that knife feel by the way amazing then cut it in half so you have two halves all right all right peel it i'm just gonna have to accept that i'm gonna smell like an onion for the rest of the day i bet you constantly smell like an onion so the onions peel now once you've fully peeled it dice it into sort of like a medium dice you probably want those little bits into i want to say a half inch i'm so slow in the kitchen oh god you're already you are 10 steps ahead of me wait are you diced yet hell no hold on i'm so peeling it oh no okay hold on we're gonna have intermission now to be honest my chop shop wasn't great here don't look stop vikram stop look away thank you a little bit of oil in the pan just to coat the bottom i already got my finger a little no really on accident are you for real are you okay no no it's tiny it's tiny why does everybody always cut themselves this early on now that the onion slice start heating your pan up i thought you were done chopping no no honestly i think one of my weaknesses in cooking is chopping an onion okay when we're done here i will show you the technique that you need to know that will set you up for life you know what they say you teach uh somebody to fish i don't know what the saying is whoa that was fast yeah it's whatever heat your pan up over medium heat now once that's hot and spicy and then onion goes in once it's hot so make sure it's hot first see that you want you want to hear that sound if you don't hear that sound emma then it's bad we're gonna have a problem all right we're tossing we're gonna let it sit without tossing it too much we're doing a quick caramelize it's more of like a little bit of a char do you make a big mess a lot when you do this uh probably not anymore not really i'm just now shoveling my onions in into the um into into the it's making zero sounds which is super promising okay good good news good news she's tapping she's getting oh i'm talking skill have you cleaned your workspace yes emma can i get your best onyo normally i would caramelize these all the way until they're super dark brown but that takes like an hour look we just don't have time for that we don't have time for that i actually cook things that only take under two hours anything above that i will not touch you always are like putting this in the fridge for two days now taking it out he's outing me already right now i am mad respect all right my onions are starting to get a little color i'm just gonna give them another minute in the pan tossing frequently i like how you're already stirring you you already get this you know what i'm not too you know not too bad do you ever sometimes use the counter as as your trash can i use the trash can as my trash okay got it we've got some that are translucent some they got some char here i'm gonna put that into my bowl the knife cuts are gonna make you they're going to keep you up at night though oh god i almost burned myself again all right we need you to survive this things are looking pretty good my onions look nice and crispy like i would literally eat this by the spoon it smells pretty delicious we have our onions now do you have two dill pickles i do how do you feel about pickles love perfect pull yourself a pika i want you to do something called a brunoise cut little tiny tiny little cubes not straight up and down but flat and then you're gonna cut it and slice it into well slices essentially into coins not coins the other way lengthwise got it it looks a little bit like this okay how's your pickle looking is it all nice and diced we're getting there i'm so interested to see what this looks like right here you're gonna big lol i'm a little messy my brain kind of works as a toddler's mite like you just see something and you just eat it yes have you ever eaten bugs uh yes really very much i've eaten live ants before i've done that actually too but they're kind of delicious they're spicy this is emma's favorite from what i understand avocado mayo i think the flavor is just more elevated it is you're gonna add three quarters of a cup you told me earlier that you're good at eyeballing i am you're gonna be impressed a quarter cup of dijon mustard we got the organic ketchup this is a healthy burger how much dijon mustard i was listening were you though oh god and then cholula to your heart's desire wait you said like a third cup of mustard oh wait you're still in the mustard oh yeah you're doing great emma you're doing great i know i feel honestly amazing before you stir it though oh hit that with a little bit oh my god what what is this salt ice cream salt my god so season the taste with salt fresh cracked black pepper if you like it it smells like burger sauce get your chives next and then you're going to thinly slices and when i say thin i mean i want these really thinly sliced if you want me to match that speed i'm going to leave here with um no no more fingers with no more fingers okay so my chives sliced uh chives go in the sauce you make cutting chives look so satisfying in your videos hey you know it's all in the it's all in the wrist i i get it it's it's a lot of other things emma when was the first time you ever cooked oh god i definitely used to help my family around the holidays but i was never doing much i usually was the one that was like choreographing dance routines for the rest of my family that's beautiful yeah i used to sing for my parents and they would be like oh my god it's so good and then looking back i'm like you're you're so embarrassing you know what i was just tasting my sauce and didn't hear anything you said i'm doing some things that are clown af your sauce is good place it to the side we're going to use that at the end so you have one more onion inside of a bowl this is where this is where the flour comes in the pot oh i heard you were afraid of the flour i am because i that just gives me from scratch vibes it's going to be from scratch everything is from except for the buns sorry guys i've learned to hate onions i do not like cutting them yeah when i worked in restaurants imagine like cutting like 200 pounds of onions no i would have quit you know those little deli containers that they give you soup in i would tape those together and tape them onto my head over my eye hello honestly genius you're going to cut these into ring like half half moon rings my workspace right now is so messy you would you would pukey now i'm using buttermilk but you're going to use soy milk soy milk i'm crying now too see you have glasses though so that's protective except for the fact that i literally just rubbed my eyes with onion juice on my hands and then obliterated the entire purpose of that so cover cover your in your soya milk we're trying to recreate buttermilk here so how do you do that you got the soy milk in there but where's the the butter right all you gotta do is add a little splash of that white distilled vinegar over there amazing we've cleaned up a little bit we're moving on to the next step we're gonna get all of our toppings prepared we've got our onions soaking that also involves the all-purpose flour which is emma's worst nightmare worst nightmare now i want you to slice your tomato how do you like your meat on your burger thick or thin thin it has to be thin it's so much better thin so nice and thin emma what's the secret to a great tomato on a burger maybe like drying it off actually that's not really wrong because i would dry it off but no it is salting them before oh i've heard about this if you skip salt in your tomatoes and put them on a burger it's gonna be easy you're fired even if you don't work at a burger shop you're fire they are gonna get watery so i'm glad you brought up that dabbing but not like that but like dabbing uh the moisture off because they are gonna produce moisture from the salt let's separate out our lattus it's living just get yourself a couple good little slices yeah i'm gonna choose my faves choose what choose my faves oh we got our lettuce got our tomatoes the onions now this is stuff i think i know what we're doing what are we doing we battered and fry the onions the onions that's correct get your cast iron pan and to that you're going to add your oil that's it that's the burger i'm going to create a burger made from plants i'm honestly so excited to be here and see if you like it i really am a fan it looks like meat i'm not going to lie people are already judging right now stop yes it still grosses me out even though it's fake um what is this a pound or i would split this in half form it into a nice little bowl this is interesting isn't it it's kind of interesting and fun right let's see if the oil is hot i don't have a thermometer so i just use my finger your oil's shimmering so you're going to just pick up a nice handful of those let them drain let that buttermilk sort of fall off the onion drop that into my flour and then toss them and they should be nice and coated place them in your spider shake off the excess it's kind it is really gorgeous ever seen an onion just get snowed on i actually have never seen that so this is a terrible comparison go ahead and carefully drop them into that hot oil and let them fry i'm taking my time and choosing my favorites fried onions are a beautiful thing you know this is scary boom onions going

Thanks to Geico for sponsoring this video!

Look I make a lot of sandwiches on this channel but that's...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, look i'll be honest i make a lot of sandwiches on this channel is that a bad thing i don't think so no but to me these two sandwiches are very special and they deliver an experience unlike any other [Music] okay look there's a lot of cliche foods out there that describe american cuisine to be honest there's not very many more things that are more american than a barbecue sandwich let's be honest the beauty of a barbecue sandwich is that perfect combination of meat and sauce what kind of meat is it how is it cooked and how is it sauced there's the north carolina version which is vinegar based or the texas version with tomato based and sweeter the point is that they're all delicious and we're making two different kinds the classic american north carolina version and a little bit of a surprise one that's quite the opposite of being american but it will still hold the spirit of a barbecue sandwich which will be combining all those flavors as best we can but do you know what else combines just as well as barbecue sauce and pulled pork combining your home and car insurance and that's where today's sponsor geico comes in both those two insurances are very important and by combining them you could save even more with geico so for bundling made easy visit geico.com today now you get on over to the link in the description to see how much you could save alrighty we're going to explore two versions of a quote-unquote bbq pork sandwich first we've got the traditional smoked north carolina style pulled pork sando but hold on a second then we have a bulgogi pork belly sando i have my suspicions about which one i'm going to like more but first let's begin with mr carolina or misses or whatever it doesn't matter first we've got to make our seasoning in a small bowl add one tablespoon or seven grams of spanish paprika one tablespoon or 15 grams of light brown sugar one tablespoon or seven grams of garlic powder two teaspoons or six grams of onion powder three tablespoons or 45 grams of kosher salt one tablespoon or seven grams of ground black pepper that's fresh ground then give that some whiskey pieces next you'll need one large bone-in boston butt roast pet that thang because it's hanging dry with paper towels and season it all over with every last bit of your seasoning you should use literally all of it so dump it and get to rub it once the whole porky man has had a nice massage place it in a smoker that's been preheated to 250 fahrenheit for four to five hours or until the internal temperature reaches 160 fahrenheit then we're gonna do some illegal smoking techniques here speed things up get a roasting tray line it with foil and add in your freshly smoked pork roast pour in one and a half cups or 350 milliliters of apple cider and half a cup or 120 milliliters of your favorite beer wrap that thing up with foil then place back in your smoker increase the temp to 300 fahrenheit and cook for three to four more hours or until irresistibly tender and the internal temp is about 205 fahrenheit then just leave your pork to rest tightly in its packet for 45 minutes now while it's resting let's make our barbecue sauce and slaw i know that north carolina is watching okay so just let me know how i do here first start with one can of tomatoes that's it that's a joke i'm kidding all right everybody say calm all right josh is a oh god in a medium saucepan add two and a half tablespoons or 40 grams of dark brown sugar one teaspoon or three grams of ground white pepper two teaspoons or five grams of cayenne powder one tablespoon or twelve grams of kosher salt two tablespoons or 30 grams of ketchup and finally two cups or 480 milliliters of apple cider vinegar give that some whiskey business and heat that on the stove over medium heat until everything is dissolved and looking lovely then just transfer that to a squirt bottle as for the slaw get a large bowl and add half a head of thinly sliced green cabbage two carrots julienned one red onion peeled and very thinly sliced and as usual make sure the onion is thin i don't understand why people think half of an inch is thin you might as well put the whole onion in your mouth if you're gonna play like that everything sub quarter inches here please anyway toss that together then add 3 tablespoons or 40 grams of mayonnaise which i know is a no-no but i like it so get over it 2 teaspoons or 10 grams of dijon mustard season a taste of salt and pepper lightly toss and add 3 tablespoons or 30 grams of apple cider vinegar give that a nice vigorous toss to coat thoroughly adjust salt and pepper levels if needed and that right there is a slaw worth the horse ride and back not sure uh where i'm going with that little piece there now once your pork is rested it should be ultra tender and when i say tender i mean so tender that the bone darn near pops out at the mere sight of you heck it flies out as soon as it sees then using gloves immediately shred your pork as finely as possible leave the fat in do not throw it away shred all that fatty flavorful goodness together then simply add your vinegar style barbecue sauce to your taste you like a lot put a lot you like a little put a little and then right there is a beautifully luxurious and moist pulled pork to assemble this bad boy all you gotta do is get some nice buns roasty and toasty on their cut sides add on a layer of pickles which we've cut lengthwise for superior pickle eating capability a nice mound of your slaw and a generous tower of your pulled pork then all you gotta do is crown your king with your top bun and head on over to the flavor mezzanine but before we do that let's take a quick look at our secondary version the bulgogi style pork belly sandwich get two pounds or 450 grams of whole skinless pork belly cut that into half inch thick strips place all that into a bowl then in a blender add a three inch knob of peeled ginger two to three peeled shallots one asian pear peeled and cheeked seven cloves of garlic half a cup or 125 grams of gochujang one tablespoon or seven grams of gochugaru two teaspoons are 5 grams of toasted sesame oil 1 tablespoon or 15 milliliters of sweet soy sauce and 2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters of dark soy sauce and finally 2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters of mirror then just blend that on high speed until completely smooth pour your gochujang sauce all over your sliced pork belly toss to coat thoroughly and allowed to marinate for 30 minutes in the fridge but ideally overnight now all you got to do is either grill this bad boy until cooked through which i actually recommend that because that would technically be the proper way to do it but if you don't have a grill you can toss it in the oven set to 450 fahrenheit for 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked beautifully and lightly charred on the outside then let that cool slightly before assembly and during that time you'll make your sandwich salad in a medium sized bowl add half a daikon peeled and julienned one english cucumber julienned as well and two large carrots peeled in julienned one serrano chili very thinly sliced then to that you're gonna add one teaspoon or four grams of granulated white sugar two teaspoons or eight grams of kosher salt and two tablespoons or 30 milliliters of unseasoned rice vinegar give that a nice toss by hand until thoroughly coated and that's your sandos salad now to assemble get some toasted buns hit the bottom bun with a light layer of koopie mayo not poopy mayo common confusion there a nice thick layer of as little or as much bulgogi pork as you want but of course a nice layer is always good a generous mound of your beautiful sando salad and finally some fresh cilantro leaves to your taste and as usual crown your king and observe a most beautiful and delectable sandwich i mean look they both look absolutely beautiful but my money is on the bulgogi sando because if i'm being completely honest that's just usually where my tongue wants to go look let's just find out if there's a tastier one or not okay so we have our north carolina pulled pork vinegar style barbecue sauce oh she is juicy in oh yeah yes mama we outdid ourselves here this has all the elements that i want the only thing i would complain about is there's a lot of acidity there's acidity from the sauce acidity from the pickles acidity from the coleslaw but is that bad no i think you could just use a little bit of your maze but other than that it's got the juiciness the smokiness it's rich it's fatty this is what i want what out of a pulled pork sando and look north carolina has been doing it like this for a while and they guys don't know what they're doing if you ain't never had one of these before going out there and get going and doing all that all right this this looks special visually if i had to choose between the two i probably would pick this one only because it looks more visually colorful and interesting but let's get a little sniff test oh oh yeah see i took my own advice here the mayo very good addition this is a personal preference thing but i really prefer the balance of this one there's sweetness there's a little bit of more spiciness and the acidity the crunch the variation of vegetables you've got the carrot and the daikon provides some sort of a magical flavor i don't know what it is just intrudes it just kind of comes in there but you don't know what's there kind of sneaking around biting people's ankles they're like oh wow what's that kind of like that and all that encapsulated with some pure acidity and the freshness the fragrance of the cilantro this is my sandwich of choice in terms of barbecue but i'll take any one of these sandwiches any time of the year you wanna know what else is full of papas moist meats b-roll [Music] okay so we made our barbecue sandwich really quick and very important thank you to our sponsor for the day geico they're helping me with my culinary journey around the united states and they want to help you too just you know by saving money on your home and car insurance what come on so head down to the link below and visit gecko.com today now let's talk about these barbecue sandwiches one of them smoked pulled pork with all sorts of southern spices and a north carolina vinegar sauce is it super duper traditional not exactly but it's close and it's very very very simple and easy to execute to me the korean style feels more meat you know it's got pork belly it's a little more interesting the flavors are more complex i just love a nice zing and umami and all those different things can't help myself okay i just can't even knowing that there's something that always brings me back to the north carolina pulled pork that just feels righteous it feels like i'm outside i'm popping open a cold one with the boys we've got two buns and a slaw and it's juicing all over us we're eating and that's a beautiful thing but either way the choice of the adventure is up to you now with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned

161,161,The 3 Dollar Brunch | But Cheaper,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4p4hAmw9yW4/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAKrL2NI6uZyn1z36yzAdhPXLXA5g,4p4hAmw9yW4,"12 minutes, 16 seconds","It's a beautiful Saturday or Sunday and you're out with your homies, you all want brunch so you indulge. After a few mimosas (or beermosas) you've officially emptied your bank account before...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, let me paint a picture for you it's a fine sunday morning you're out with your homies you want brunch you go there couple mimosas later and the bill's like 120 bro and tip's not in there yet but what if i told you you could make a brunch for all your homies for this price per person that is but cheaper [Music] oh huh this is better than i remember it not bad okay so when it comes to brunch right there's multiple little things that we get we like our eggs benedict we like our mimosas we like them you know little potatoes some sort of potato right why is there why is there always a potato so it's always something so we're going to combine all the components that make a great brunch and make it as cheaply as we physically can that's what the series is all about at the end of the day we don't want to lose any flavor or quality we just want to drop the price so with all that said let's make this shall we we've got all of our necessities here folks you got your eggs benedict an ultra classic roasted potato hash some gorgeous caramelized banana crepes with horchata cream and a well but cheaper version of a mimosa we'll get into that last let's begin with our eggs benedict look this is real simple and yes we're making our own english muffins papa always makes his own or well usually at least start with 2 cups or 480 milliliters of milk heat that to 95 fahrenheit then add 3.5 tablespoons or 45 grams of granulated white sugar and two and a half teaspoons or eight grams of instant yeast mix all that together and let it sit until it becomes fatty and frothy then in the bowl of a stand mixer add 4 3 cup or 675 grams of bread flour 2 teaspoons or 14 grams of fine sea salt begin mixing that with the dough spiral thing over medium low add your bricked up yeast mixture one whole large egg then just let that mix scraping down the sides as needed and let that knead till smooth about 3 minutes total then start adding a quarter cup or 56 grams of unsalted softened butter one tablespoon at a time letting it incorporate before adding another tablespoon until all of your butt is added once incorporated and smooth give your dough some slap and folds roll into a nice ball and place in a greased bowl covered with plastic wrap including a nice and regal name and let it rise for about an hour or until doubled and festively plump then punch down your little man plop it onto a lightly floured work surface and divide into 15 even pieces then roll each of those pieces into a light bowl rest covered for 10 minutes then once your balls have had a nice relaxing slumber begin cranking a large cast iron skillet over medium heat once it's hot grab one of your plump balls dust the top generously with cornmeal and press it down until you get a disc that's about three to four inches wide make sure both sides are dusted with cornmeal and place in your pan evenly spaced apart in batches of three and let those cook for three to five minutes per side till nice and browned flip and repeat on the other side as you finish those place them on a baking sheet and finish in an oven set to 350 fahrenheit for eight to ten minutes and the internal temperature is about 200 fahrenheit now those are some luscious english muffins just let those cool to room temp on a wire rack while those are cooling let's make our roast potato hash by the way you can totally make the hash and the batter for the crepes while the english muffins are rising so you know if you want to be efficient maybe do that anyway get yourself a large bowl and add two pounds of russet potatoes that have been peeled and diced into half inch cubes one sweet onion also diced and one red bell pepper diced beautifully as well and maybe toss in a slice serrano chili or a jalapeno for a little kick although that was not in the recipe and uh i don't know why i went rogue here and did that but hey it's gemmy season that tastes generously with salt 2 teaspoons or 8 grams of chipotle powder 2 teaspoons or 7 grams of garlic powder give it a light toss and last add 3 tablespoons or 42 grams of vegetable oil toss until evenly coated and place those on a baking sheet lime with foil and pop into an oven set to 425 fahrenheit for 30 to 40 minutes or until crisp on the edges and cooked through now while those are cooking we can get our crepe batter put together two bowl add one cup or 150 grams of all-purpose flour one and a half tablespoons or 20 grams of granulated white sugar and half a teaspoon or four grams of fine sea salt give that some whiskey then make a little well in the flour and add two whole eggs and begin whisking those together then whisk in one and a half cups or 350 milliliters of whole milk keep whisking until everything is thoroughly combined and you have a smooth batter then let that batter rest for 10 to 20 minutes before using okay while that batter is resting we can make our hollandaise for the eggs benedict we're not doing this the traditional way so if you're traditionalist or a purist please close your eyes and plug your ears now in a high-powered blender add three egg yolks two and a half tablespoons or 35 milliliters of lemon juice begin blending on high speed until the eggs begin to turn a pale yellow then slowly stream in half a cup or 110 grams of gently melted unsalted butter emphasis on gently melted if it's piping hot it'll curdle the egg and we well you know you know the drill we just want it in a liquid state that's warm not hot like the fiery endless depths of the underworld once all of your butter is added season it to taste with salt and a touch more lemon juice if needed to loosen then pour your hollandaise into a thermos to keep it warm and really you do need to keep this warm because if you let it go cold and it'll turn solid and be rendered useless okay back to our crepe batter get yourself a non-stick 10-inch skillet and spray it with cooking spray and begin heating over medium heat once that's hot add a third cup of your batter and quickly swirl the pan around to coat the entire surface simply let that cook for two minutes or until it starts to get a little browned flip and repeat for one more minute on the other side then repeat until you use all of your quake batter that's it that's a beautiful crepe and aren't they just oh so lovely my little oh wait that's uh is that supposed to be french oh so lovely i want to give it a little kiss from pepe okay we're now ready to assemble all our things first eggs benedict to get a poached egg it's real easy stop being a little baby and psyching yourself out i believe in you okay you've got this bring a medium pot of water to a very gentle boil borderline a simmer and add a splash of vinegar then once it's gently boiling begin swirling the water in one direction with a spoon to create a whirlpool in the center then carefully lower one egg that's already been cracked into a ramekin into the center of that whirlpool then sort of let it wrap the whites around itself and just leave it don't let it boil just keep that gentle heat and cook for three minutes or until the whites are solid and the yolk is still runny repeat with the rest of your eggs which you'll need about eight total for four servings unless you're only eating one of these by the way you can totally do this with two or more at a single time but it does require more skill next for your ham we're going to use normal smoked deli ham instead of canadian bacon sear it in a lightly greased pan for about one minute or until browned beautifully you only need one piece per english muffin then just toast the english muffins place it top your browned ham your beautifully poached eggs looking plump and juicy top both of those with your warm hollandaise sauce then finally top with fresh sliced chives a little fresh cracked black pepper and a touch of flaky salt and look you know that just by looking at this it's gonna be busting sorry that's terrible for the potatoes assemble those cooked starchy boys on a plate hit that with lots of nice random dots of sour cream if desired then top with some fresh herbs of choice such as parsley or fresh sliced chives or even both look we don't judge here unless you like hot avocado then we judge oh and of course you can hit it with flaky salt as well now last but not least for your crepes quickly make your filling by starting with 2 cups of heavy whipping cream in a bowl begin whisking vigorously and once it starts to thicken add in 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of granulated white sugar keep whisking until it reaches a soft peak then mix in 1 teaspoon or four grams of ground cinnamon that's it that's your cinnamon for the bananas it's ridiculously simple you just slice two bananas in half lengthwise coat the cut sides with sugar and using either a good broiler or kitchen torch hit it with lots of good heat until amber and caramelized basically like a creme brulee but you know on a banana so open up a crepe on one side spread on a good dollop of your cinnamon cream filling then fold it in half kind of like a taco then in half again to create a triangular shape repeat with all of your crepes line them up nice and snug on a plate like the line to the dmv then top with a long boy caramelized banana and optionally hit it with some powdered sugar and a fat generous drizzle of maple syrup now all these plates coming together at a total price of this much per person for the whole ass meal that is a beautiful number right there i mean you're this is a small plates meal at a fancy ratio on this point now that means if you were to just get the eggs benedict for example you'd be eating it for this much per serving you're usually paying close to twenty dollars for one plate of benedict oh but wait we're not done josh how do you make a cheaper mimosa champagne is so expensive well that's because we're making something called a beer mosa sounds gross but it's basically a shandy simply fill a glass a quarter full with fresh squeezed orange juice and top that with your favorite blonde or amber summer beer and enjoy a most aromatic and hoppy tasting mimosa that not only saves you money but doesn't sacrifice on flavor in any way whatsoever plus this makes as much or as little as you want per large glass no brunch mimosa price can compare for anyone who's in texas the lights have gone out permanently it just rains every day we are here in the dark to eat a brunch it doesn't feel like brunch but the beauty of all this coming together i feel the spirit within my body first thing before we even start we've gotten our cocktail we've got our mimosa or in this case a beer mosa we gotta save money bro we're saving money why would you get an expensive bottle of champagne i might as well use something a little bit cheaper it's beautiful it's refreshing ice cold it's bubbly i i was worried about the funk of a beer but if you choose the right beer then you can still meet that quality i would even argue that a nice sour beer would go beautifully with this let's go into the benedict this isn't really all that different from any other eggs benedict except we cut costs by not buying expensive canadian bacon you're buying canadian bacon for eleven dollars for four slices jojo you close your eyes like as if you are guilty of that are you guilty of that no baby i'm gonna have to give you a kiss you know what i realized i forgot a little bit of paprika does that do anything flavor-wise no but it is nostalgic i really actually prefer this over a traditional eggs benedict the smokiness of the ham you have more versatility and flavor delicious 10 out of 10. okay potatoes we're just gonna pretend that these potatoes haven't been sitting here for three and a half hours a potato shouldn't do this but when roasted properly they're delicious they're ultra crisp and fluffy on the inside okay the standard ones are actually good this kind of comes together a little bit like a baked potato but there's no bacon if you added bacon the price would go all the way up right so just don't add bacon the chipotle powder brings the smokiness of the bacon wood the sour cream is well sour component and it's the baked potato combination flavor of potato and cream the chives the parsley it's spiced it's rich and you can eat it all day long you've been hanging out with your homies for a while brunch is almost done you think you know what i want one more thing caramelized banana crepes cinnamon whipped cream we did something with this this is by far the best out of the three granted totally different because it's dessert the banana plays perfectly with the cinnamon it's rich but it's balanced at the same time this fruity sweet and slightly tart banana brings everything together in a way that just makes sense speaking of things that make sense this is a brunch for this price per person it doesn't get any better than that sip your beer mosa and shut the hell up and have a beautiful sunday morning you want to know what else is full of big plump jiggly eggs b-roll all right guys and that is it so we had our brunch for this dollar amount per person what more do you want from me maybe it's not the most perfect price but at least it's about 120 dollars brother but this still has all the traditional flavors that you want in a brunch the textures everything do you even want to go out anymore probably chances are you will but hey it's there so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time someone's calling me right now who's calling me you know what they want to be on camera fine i'm afraid to answer because oh they hung up [Music] you

With that...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, this is easily one of the grossest sounding most delicious foods on the planet and it is the fish taco it just doesn't sound right but hear me [Music] okay so today we are making fish tacos but not just any fish taco we're making two different iterations a grilled version and a fried version this is one of those overlooked menu items that i know there's a coveted group of people that will live and die for a fish taco and then there's the group of people who never order it and if they just did their lives would be changed forever and that's a fact or well maybe it's more of an opinion the point still stands look there's not much else to say let me just show you the way and then we can figure out how we feel about it sound good okay great let's make this shall we let's make this simple we have two tacos a beautiful yakitori style grilled fish taco with a grilled pineapple relish sounds fancy well that's because it low key is brother and of course we have our down bad naughty fried fish with a chili crema with a [Music] of slaw let's cover this first use whatever tortillas you want fresh flour tortillas are great but the ideal choice would be a beautifully hot and fresh corn tortilla with a touch of char now first off let's sing the beauties of our perfectly grilled fish oh josh but grilled fish is boring and yucky and hard wrong congratulations you're wrong grilled fish is one of the greatest foods of all time and it is commonly also one of the most up cooked items on the entire planet i mean really people can't seem to get it right and we're gonna stop that today first you gotta pick the right fish make sure it at least has some level of fat on it and then grill it beautifully that's really all you need to do but before we even start that let's make our relish fire up a grill or in this case a yakitori grill you can use either or normal gas grill yakitori up to you i get mine set up by getting a few blocks of binchitan nice and red hot over just a stovetop and a chimney and then placing those hot coals in the same direction with some unheated binchoton in my conro grill and i just leave that there to catch and get hot now get half of your grill nice and hot on high heat and the other half completely off or just no heat then snack yourself a nice ripe pineapple cut off the top and the bottom then slice the skin off by running your knife around the shape of the pineapple doing your best to leave as much flesh on as possible of the pineapple then cut it in half then in half again to get quarters then take those to your grill grease the grates in your pineapples lightly and place in the hot side of your grill flipping often for about four to eight minutes or until you get nice caramelized and charred on all sides don't overdo the char here some of these pieces were a little too close to being too far then just remove those from the grill let it cool slightly and use a sharp knife to remove the course from all your quartered pineapple and dice that brother up into bite-sized pieces to your relish add two pickled jalapenos thinly sliced one serrano chili very thinly sliced one tablespoon of finely chopped cilantro and one teaspoon of finely chopped fresh oregano finally add one clove of garlic grated then season that to taste with salt and the juice of two limes finish with a nice glug of good quality extra virgin olive oil you know you really want to get that viscosity going a nice spicy olive note along with that fruity pineapple sounds blessing to me alright it's fishy time get yourself two pounds of good white fish that's not too thick i personally went with three full sides of bronzino and then divided those into three pieces each that'll give you six to eight tacos you might be wondering what in the witchcraft keeps my fish from sticking to the grill how does he do it well first off i like to use a separate rack and more importantly you ready for this non-stick cooking spray will keep it from sticking so first get yourself a separate small stainless steel wire rack give that a light spray then give the skin and the flesh of your fish a light spray as well season a taste with salt and pepper then pop those bad boys inside down onto your wire rack you know as many as you can fit reasonably you may need to do two batches here then just place those on the hot side of the grill and let them grill for about one to two minutes and once you can see that the cook of the fish begins to travel halfway up the flesh and the skin is crisp and lightly charred give it a gentle flip to the flesh side and pop it to the middle of your grill and let it finish cooking by the radiant heat for just another 30 seconds if your fish is flat enough it should cook that quickly now if it's thicker may take a minute or two now once those are done let's take them inside to assemble really easy get a hot corn tortilla lay on your beautifully crisp skinned grilled man a nice couple spoonfuls of your grilled pineapple relish some diced avocado optionally some fresh sliced radishes for crunch and optionally some cilantro leaves for extra freshness yes you can serve these with a salsa like the jalapeno salsa from my many taco guides but it's perfectly great on its own here and look despite it looking unnecessarily fancy it truly is unnecessarily delicious and our bodies are about to find out but first we're going to talk about the fried fish version if we're doing fried fish you cannot do it without a crunchy cabbage sauce to make that you only need half a head of cabbage which still produces like you know 450 pounds of shredded cabbage but anyway you're gonna slice that as thinly as you possibly can i want absolute ribbons followed by half a red onion peeled and very thinly sliced as well i mean when i say thin on this by the way you should borderline be able to see through these to that you're gonna add a quarter cup of finely chopped cilantro and next you want the zest of two limes hit that with salt to taste and the juice of your two limes protip if your limes are giving you a hard time just roll them on the board like the bad little lime that they are they like it it also makes for efficient juicing hit that with two tablespoons of extra virgin uh olive oil you got a nasty mind anyway give that a toss until thoroughly combined and adjust salt acid and olive oil levels to your desired well level for the crema it's real simple get one guajillo and one ancho chili optionally de-seed them then cover those with water and bring to a boil let that boil for about five minutes or until they're super soft and easy to tear fish your chilies out of the water get it fish because we're doing a fish taco okay that's stupid place in a blender then begin blending adding the cooking water just until it begins to blend easily we don't want pure liquid you just want something super duper smooth now to a medium-sized bowl add a third cup of mayonnaise a third cup of sour cream one tablespoon of hot sauce one tablespoon of smoked paprika half of your pureed chilies whisk together until thoroughly combined season the taste of salt and add additional chili paste if needed this is gonna be up to you now optionally you can add one to two cloves of grated garlic if you want this to have some garlicky kick to it but it's beautiful on its own now look at this sauce just by the mere visuals of it i wanna be in a bathtub full of it just plop it around in there okay last thing we need to fry our fish we're beer battering this bit because well it's gemmy first you'll need one and a half pounds of cod cut into pieces that will snugly fit in a tortilla now they will expand a little so keep that in mind i would say going for a two and a half inch by one inch log would have been the most ideal shape here but it's really up to you from there season your fish generously with kosher salt and let it sit in room temp for 15 minutes to quick cure to make your batter get a large bowl and add 1 cup of all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons of white pepper 2 teaspoons of smoked paprika one tablespoon of garlic powder and one tablespoon of kosher salt give that some whiskey till thoroughly combined now crack an egg and uh crush it by accident that really helps good job let's try that again crack in one egg and whisk together until you get a very shaggy dough then slowly stream in one 12-ounce can of beer the ideal choice here is going to be some sort of a lager or a real light sort of summer beer then just keep whisking until everything is added and you have a smooth yet viscous batter if it's not viscous enough just add a small pinch of flour and that should do it now fill a large heavy bottom pot with at least two inches of oil heat that puppy to 365 fahrenheit then all you got to do is toss your fish in a separate bowl of just plain all-purpose flour this is about half a cup make sure the fish is completely coated then shake off the excess drop it in your batter to coat on all sides then carefully remove it from the batter and drop it into your hot oil and that's it then just let it fry for three to five minutes or until golden brown and crisp you can usually do about two to four pieces of fish at a time depending on the size of your pot don't overcrowd it then just pull that out of the oil using a spider and place it on a wire rack to drain then count your blessings because lord have mercy then just repeat that process with all your fish maybe crack open a cold one with the boys then once all your fish is fried comes the easiest part pop down a nice hot tortilla hit it with a fatty of fish followed by an artfully drizzled pattern of your crema and a generous mound of your perfect slaw you know i tried adding different garnishes here like maybe some serrano or some cilantro but you know what this is beautiful in its own right it's unadulterated raw form is just perfect so let's have it the way it's meant to be give it a taste test and see if there truly is a greater fish taco all right we have two tacos de poisson reason why i use the french term is i might have made these a little fancier than really necessary let's be honest you just throw some stuff in a nice properly heated tortilla a little bit of char it's got the chew it's got some crisp penis to it if you will let's start off with the more healthy sort of uh austin texas version if you will how long they've been sitting here an hour despite them sitting so long the flavor the crunch in the skin is still there it's salty the fish is perfectly cooked you got the sweetness from the pineapple you get a little bit of pickliness from the pickled jalapeno layered chilies cilantro everything it all comes together into a beautiful symphony of fragrance and freshness this is a summer style taco you can have this be a summer taco kind of you'd be sweating a lot but you'll be happy anyway pat it down this is a fatty here we go welcome to the symphony of sounds oh good look obviously i'm gonna choose the fried one fried things are just always infinitely better but in the right context the right weather this is the choice but for any time of the year winter summer it doesn't matter this fried fish taco comes through you got the beard batter you got the crunch it's salty it's acidic and it all finishes off with a nice mildly spicy you can make it more spicy ancho chili crema what more do you want brother you want to know what else is a fish taco maybe don't answer that because i feel like that goes too many directions but um [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our fish tacos two different ways and they came out gorgeous the grilled version was probably my favorite one but if you're in the right mood and you get that beer battered fried fish and aioli and it's spicy and rich and acidic and crunchy it's kind of hard to beat just make this taco for somebody who isn't expecting it that hopefully enjoys fish blow their mind and change their life forever and it's gonna be beautiful time papa love you papa gesu make it however you want you can change the sausage you can add a salsa you can take away a salsa if you want to replace the pineapple with maybe i don't know grilled apple that could maybe potentially work i didn't really think that through maybe not grilled apple mango mango would work that would be good so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] you

How about the coveted ice cream sandwich but in two different ways? That's right, we're making the classic ice cream sandwich and a dense...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, i think most people can make a sandwich and enjoy a sandwich but buddy what about a dessert [Music] sandwich [Music] good evening how are you papa's little baby today we'll be reading a story from my book doesn't even work what is that okay so today we are making the coveted ice cream sandwich two different ways we're making the classic one the one that we've all seen with the two chocolate rectangles and then ice cream rectangular prism in between those two sandwich beautifully they're soft they're chocolatey and for some reason you can eat like 12 of them in one sitting and you're completely fine i don't know what it what what it is some sort of magic portal of calorie consumption and the second one is gonna be an even more calorie and dense decadent version which we'll see at the end and brother we're making all this from scratch as usual we're gonna make the ice cream we're gonna make the cookie base the cookie to put together you see where i'm going with this now with all that said let's make this shall we okay we're doing this right first we'll make our salted butter chocolate cookie ice cream sandos which are based off the ones that you buy at the grocery store you know the ones that never seem satiating enough so you eat like five of them and after that we'll have an ultimate chocolate chip cookie ice cream basically a burger at that point now to make our freezer section version we need our cookie base get yourself a medium pot and fill it with just about an inch of water bring that water to a boil then reduce to a light simmer place a heat proof bowl on top of that and add 2 cups or 315 grams of semi-sweet chocolate 1 cup or 227 grams of salted butter yes salted let that heat and melt while stirring occasionally until completely melted pull that off the heat and whisk in one cup or 210 grams of granulated sugar two whole eggs one egg at a time plus one egg yolk two teaspoons or six grams of vanilla extract give that some whiskey to thoroughly combined then in a separate bowl add 2 cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon or 5 grams of baking soda 2 teaspoons or 5 grams of espresso powder half a cup or 60 grams of unsweetened cocoa powder whisk together till combined now just stir your chocolate mixture into your flour mixture and mix together until you have a lovely firm dough get two baking sheets that have been heavily greased and edged to edge lined with parchment paper really be sure to grease this whole darn thing plus the parchment now divide that little poopy baby man into two even pieces and just press those guys down to fill out the entire rimmed sheet don't you go and flip out on me while you're doing this it's gonna take a minute or two it might not seem like enough but i assure you that if evenly pressed it will fit the whole thing to the appropriate thickness so calm down buddy once that's pressed pop it into an oven set to 350 fahrenheit and bake for 10 to 12 minutes then pull it out let it cool for 12 to 15 minutes on a wire rack then pop it into the freezer for at least 15 minutes and up to two hours now while that's getting chilled let's talk ice cream i mean ice cream that uh came out wrong let's make this simple you can use any ice cream on this channel but i might as well just show you a quick and easy vanilla bean ice cream in a medium pot add 3 cups or 700 milliliters of whole milk add the beans from one whole vanilla bean pod begin heating that over medium heat stirring occasionally then while that's heating in a bowl add four egg yolks then mix in one and a half cups or 260 grams of granulated white sugar so you sort of get a sandy egg mixture boy that sounds gross once your milk is hot and steamy but not boiling begin whisking in small ladle fulls of your hot milkies into your yolks until the yolk mixture is hot and liquidy then pour that back into your pot and continue heating and stirring over medium heat making sure not to boil and not to simmer because if you simmer papa i i don't even know i guess i know geese just until it begins to thicken it'll take about five to seven minutes now just strain that mixture into a bowl set over an ice bath and cool it down finally mix in three cups or 700 milliliters of heavy whipping cream and that's your custard base now all you need to do is pop that into an ice cream maker turn according to the manufacturer's directions and you have your ice cream let me just explain something real quick when you have fresh churned ice cream right when it's done it's still kind of soft and pliable which is ideal for the next step but if you don't want to make your own be sure to put any store-bought ice cream into a stand mixer or some sort of a mixer to beat it up and soften it to a spreadable but not melted consistency anyway pull out your cookie base and spread on a half gallon of ice cream whether it's your own or store bought then carefully remove your other cookie base and invert it to place atop the other one press that down firmly then place your other baking sheet on top and leave in the freezer to press for four hours or overnight now from there all you gotta do is pop it out remove the parchment trim the edges nicely and cut into even rectangles i would say something that's about two and a half inches by four inches will create the proper shape reminder you only have about five to ten minutes before these begin to turn too melty so i'd recommend working quickly here then just wrap each individual sandwich in a piece of plastic wrap and store it in the freezer for well pretty much as long as you want and that is your ice cream sandal these look so beautifully delicious in the most tack sharp rectangular way i can imagine plus this recipe makes a ton of sandals so they should last you a good while unless you're my girlfriend and you ate all of them before i got to have one thank you for that by the way okay so we have a wrapped filler that looks like a goddang ice cream sandwich now how do we do that well through time patience effort love trust peace serenity sweetness heart power strength a little bit of stinkiness the first thing you smell is the cookie it's more like a brownie rather than the traditional one that you would see the one with the holes i think this is really just a brownie ice cream sandwich and i'm not complaining about that not one my intention when i made this cookie base was for it to be more like that chocolate base that you see everywhere you know we've seen it in stores it's an old wrapper and peel it off but instead what you get is this rich chocolate nearly brownie like it's got that caramelization long story short this is already better but texturally i do wish this was softer so if you let these sit a little longer this crusty outside will get nice and soft and flexible and pliable just like you know but with a brownie flavor it's intensified there's real intentional flavor and you can control whatever ice cream you could ever want okay next is our famous chocolate chip cookies in the form of well an ice cream sandwich look this is pretty straight up to make the cookies start by melting three quarters of a cup or 168 grams of unsalted butter until completely um melted obviously then in a bowl or a stand mixer combine three quarters of a cup or 161 grams of packed light brown sugar three quarters of a cup or 150 grams of granulated white sugar pop on the whiskey or obviously a regular whisk should you not have a stand mixer also we gave away stain mixers on the discord so if you're not a part of the discord the link's in the bio anyway whisk that together and while whisking stream in all of your melted butter follow that up with one and a half teaspoons or nine grams of sea salt mix until thoroughly combined then add in one whole large egg followed by one egg yolk whisk that nice and vigorously to emulsify it into sort of a texture switch your attachment to the paddle or a spoon then add in one and a quarter cup or 197 grams of all-purpose flour mix gently until combined into a loose dough then fold in with a spatula 8 ounces or 225 grams of about 60 to 70 cacao dark chocolate that's been very roughly chopped yes it's a lot because papa like a lot anyway cover that bad boy refrigerate for at least one hour or overnight then using an ice cream scoop scoop out as many balls as you can on a parchment-lined baking sheet and obviously you can go with a smaller scoop don't try and be smart in the comments and say what if i want smaller cookies josh well by using basic spatial analytical skills you'll see in fact that a smaller cookie scoop will make smaller cookies okay maybe papa being a little bit of a grouchy little pants man anyway if they are large cookies pop them into an oven set to 350 fahrenheit and bake for 15 to 17 minutes intentionally picking the pan up and dropping it every four to five minutes this is also known as the pan bang method makes it a little more dense then once done pull your cookies out really take in their natural beauty the curvature of their almost rolling mountainous chocolatey surface maybe even add a little twinkle of flaky salt on top now that is a properly luxurious chocolate chip cookie the next step is ridiculously simple stack on some scoops of ice cream this is so unnecessarily large that we needed multiple scoops but if it was properly sized then it would be only one scoop now as they say let us put this in our mouth okay so we didn't have to make it this big but for some reason i chose ice cream scoop for this size i do like a giant cookie and i didn't really think well wait a minute josh you're making ice cream sandwiches in this episode of josh doesn't think things through here's a very large ice cream sandwich if you want it smaller do i really need to explain it use a smaller scoop it's math is it math this could be either the worst cross section or the greatest cross section of all time okay these are too big if this was the correct size this would be the greatest chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich that has ever existed in mankind period this is boys and respectfully and this puts an end to our ice cream sandwich guide look at the end of the day we made the traditional one we made a fantastic chocolate chip cookie one but you could use any cookie you want you could use any ice cream you want we've given you the bare necessities that you need in order to make the greatest so go on go on and do the darn thing brother and don't you turn back you want to know what else is full of drippy chili cream filled cookies [Music] b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our ice cream sandwiches they came out beautifully and let's quickly talk about the rectangular ones first off that turned out way better than i could have possibly imagined i had no idea that it was going to come out so geometrically perfect i mean they really look good and not only that but it makes a lot of them if it's not proof enough for me to say that it's good all i have to do is say that kate has already eaten all of those ice cream sandwiches i mean literally all of them by herself that's safe to say that they are very good and then the chocolate chip cookie ones i mean that was like this egregious gigantic version that i wanted to make but it just proves the point that putting ice cream in between two cookies can just never be wrong ever and so with all that said if you enjoyed

one and a half teaspoons of salt and one tablespoon of sugar you can also add the sugar to the yeast mixture if you want start by mixing all that in a stand mixer first add three tablespoons of vegetable oil then your yeasty milky mixture followed by an egg and an egg yolk mix that until smooth and supple and you just wanna spank it shape into a ball and place in a greased bowl covered with plastic wrap for one hour or until doubled then simply punch its face to degas divide that into eight pieces you can always just weigh the dough and divide that number by eight if you want to be super about it then shape those pieces of dough into nice rotund balls place them into a baking sheet lined with parchment paper evenly spaced apart then place another inverted baking sheet on top of those

per bun now let's talk sauce we can make this super simple get yourself one sweet onion and you can slice it into half moons but in my case i chose to give it a rough dice get a large pan heat up enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan set it over medium high and once it's ripping hot hot oh my gosh add in your onions and toss a coat with oil then just let those sear until they start to get some color toss again sear for another minute or so and once you get some nice light charring and they begin to turn translucent season them to taste with salt and they're done about five minutes total next get a medium bowl add one cup or 240 grams of mayonnaise half cup or 125 grams of ketchup half cup or 125 grams of yellow mustard specifically don't get fancy on me okay this is a butt cheaper gosh darn it nothing wrong with a little yellow musty rusty followed by one dill pickle that's been finely diced and of course your seared onion give that some whiskey business season generously with salt and fresh cracked black pepper and stir to taste until seasoned to your liking that's it and this makes a ton of sauce decently over one pint and you only need like two to three tablespoons per burger so you're looking at around 20 servings that means that this is bop per serving wow on to the next you need some nice ground buff look for something a little fattier between 70 to 80 percent lean this is one and a half pounds or 680 grams divide that into eight even pieces this is if you want a double patty it would be four if you only want one patty from all those pieces into balls wow a lot of balls on today's episode good job josh we're proud once it's done place to the side and we'll sear those in just a second first get your most beautiful buns give them a light coat with butter or vegetable oil slice them in half and toast in a pan until golden brown and luxurious this recipe serves four so you need 4 buns i'm no mathematical genius but i am once toasted get ready for assembly then next get yourself a large pan heat that over medium high until ripping hot optionally you can spray with cooking spray to prevent sticking then once it's hot hot oof place down a ball and using the flat side of a spatula press that bad boy down until it's round and a little thinner than half an inch then season it to taste with salt and fresh cracked black pepper let that sear for two minutes give her a flip and marvel at its crusty brown my yard beauty hit it with a slice of cheddar cheese let that sear for one more minute and then either quickly broil or blow torch the cheese just until barely melted try to avoid bubbling grab your toasty roasty buns sauce them on both cut sides generously add your first patty to the bun then move back to the pan add your next ball and same thing sear it press it season it with salt and pepper sear flip season again and this time adding a slice of american cheese yes that's correct one classy cheese and one trashy cheese it'll make sense sear one more minute and melt the cheese then add atop your other patty carefully now don't get too excited then hit the top with a fatty dollop of your sauce and finally crown your king and look there isn't much to say about this burger because i believe one gaze upon this will speak for itself better yet i have a feeling that one bite will sing for us all and for this price per burger for a gourmet burger unmatchable then let us taste test wow [Music] just looking at this if i saw this right in front of me and someone's like paid 20 for this right now i'd be like okay yes oh my god it's so juicy oh my god mommy that's for everybody who says i don't feed my employees anyway so we have this amazing burger it's beautifully juicy it is beautifully fatty you've got the crunch from the little baby pickles the charred onion there's sweetness there the mustard comes through it's like this is a burger i would easily pay 15 for without fries they're like josh fry's or another five dollars yeah okay fine because this burger is very jummy and for the record if you want to add tomato lettuce whatever that adds like another 25 cents a serving easy money but cheaper we don't go and did it and this burger is fire come on get it i'm gonna eat this burger you want to know what else has your eyes locked on my glistening buns beer [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our butt cheaper burger for this price per person for delicious perfect burgers why am i saying delicious stop it stop it at the end of the day a burger is like i said a commonly cheap item but we really have sort of moved in that direction where you're going out you're spending 15 16 17 18 20 25 for a burger which honestly doesn't even sound that outlandish anymore granted it's more of an

an absolute takeout classic and you think we're not gonna make the best version ever because if you do well you'd be mistaken [Music] okay so we're making mongolian beef today where does that come from i don't really know anymore at this point but something about it rings in the air beautifully sauced crisp beef it feels right it just makes a little bit of a and it's usually a dish that's

membership where you literally get bacon for free for the rest of your life do i need to say more about that i mean hello anyway back to mongolian beef from what i've researched it looks like mongolian beef has nothing to do with mongolian cuisine whatsoever which is a bummer i've had it from places that it's delicious and i've had it from places that it's horrible but it's just one of those takeout classics that i really love making a rendition of my own at home that has some level of tradition or some level of involved and that's what i want so with all that said let's make this shall we okay despite its lack of tradition this is quite possibly one of the easiest stir-fried dishes in the game so no complaining to papa all right first things first rice as you know get some good medium grain rice okay so our last upload in the big mac we announced the cookbook it's right here but i have something very important to say three hours after we announced that it went to number one in all books number one it's pre-order time now which is the most important phase so if you want to get one please get one now but more importantly massive massive massive thank you i'm totally befuddled that's a good word the point is everybody worked really hard on this we're all very very proud to see it go to number one it is number one in the us canada australia in all books not just number one in some subcategory number one because of you guys i'm very grateful thank you so much link in the description anyway back to mongolian beef please rinse your rice twice or i will call uncle roger and it's gonna be a bad day your rice just won't be as good that's what i'm trying to say then cook it in a proper rice cooker for the musical quartet and for the perfect rice but that's just my favorite way to do it now let's talk beef you'll need one pound of flank steak something decently marbled because we will be cooking it around medium or maybe even slightly above slice that brother about a half an inch thick and you can certainly go thinner if you'd like but i'd recommend freezing the beefy man for 15 to 20 minutes to make it easier to slice that thin once that's done toss it into a bowl and place it to the side next let's season our wok always season the wok why because nothing will stick and papa will still hug you [Music] to do that simply pour in about three to four tablespoons of vegetable oil heat that over medium high swirling occasionally until the oil begins to smoke then discard that oil and wipe it out with a paper towel that's it it's seasoned now add in another three tablespoons of fresh vegetable oil and begin heating again over medium-high now while it's heating up toss your beef with a quarter cup of cornstarch half a teaspoon of ground white pepper and a pinch of salt toss that to coat thoroughly and now you have your dusted beef that kind of looks like some sort of bovine winter wonderland that's now ready to be shallow fried into oblivion now once your oil is ripping hot shake off the excess cornstarch and shallow fry each piece of beef in batches to avoid overcrowding for two to three minutes per side or until beautifully browned like so placing to the side as they finish browning now once you're done with that leave your heat on medium medium-high and add in one bunch of green onions that's been cut into two inch segments let those sear for about 30 seconds toss and sear again until you get some nice caramelization then add in one tablespoon of finely chopped ginger two red fresno chili thinly sliced two teaspoons of gochugaru stir fry that for about 45 seconds to get that good old-fashioned wok hay then add half a cup of brown sugar stir-fry that in then a quarter cup of dark soy sauce a quarter cup of regular soy sauce a quarter cup of water a splash of rice vinegar then let that boil and reduce for three minutes or until it begins to thicken slightly then add in your beef toss and stir to coat thoroughly and the sauce thickens all the way it should be more of like a glaze consistency if you will mmm papa's glazed meat shimmering turn off the heat and add a small handful of thai basil and 5 cloves of very finely chopped garlic stir that all in until thoroughly combined and beautifully [Music] and that's literally it that's your beef isn't she lovely now if you want broccoli i'd recommend breaking it down into nice florets coating it with oil and roasting it at 425 fahrenheit on a foil lined baking sheet until browned and lightly crisp but that's up to you if you want to be an extra little fancy healthy little pants man then you can do that it's actually quite good with broccoli though now all you need to do is get a bowl top it up heavily with your beautifully steamed rice as much or as little as you want maybe a little extra sauce if you're feeling saucy some finely shaved green onion both for some green and that fresh onion flavor now that is a bowl of beef and i'm ready to put it in my mouth so let's do that okay so despite the fact that this is not at all mongolian in any way whatsoever i'm pretty sure it's just one of those classic takeout meals you can't you can't say no to that oh mama the sauce is spicy it's fragrant it's sweet it's salty rich umami see the beautiful thing about this is anytime you normally get mongolian beef like if you're going to pf chiang's which is like this is this a but better is this i don't even know anymore at this point it's usually pretty underwhelming the sauce is like too salty or there's just bland this has a multitude of layers of all i have to say is no matter what mongolian beef that you've ever had this is probably going to be the best version period what in the gosh darn heck are you waiting for you want to know what else is full of papa's glazed meats b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our mongolian beef real quick thank you to our sponsors butcher box for well sponsoring this video be sure to go to the link in the description to get your order ten dollars off the first one it's a beautiful thing now for the mongolian beef we don't did it i'm really really happy with how this turned out it was very balanced it was sweet salty umami it had balance with acidity a little bit of spice it was just everything that i wanted and more importantly it had that good classic wakay the breath of the walk and last but certainly not least is that it's extremely easy to make and i know i say that all the time but you know what i'm just trying to be honest with you and whether you want to take me being honest as me being mean or me just trying to be truthful because that's what i'm trying to do here it is easy now with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something like subscribe and i will see you next [Music] time [Music] you

wait right now i have the most important announcement we have ever had on this channel in the history of this channel yeah today is the first day and the launch of something i've been working on in the background for a while my cookbook let me explain [Music] that is everything you should not be doing with my book it is out for pre-order today right now you can go to amazon go to the link in the description pre-order the book the more pre-orders the better it is for us we worked really hard on this for you this entire book is an exact reflection of everything you guys have asked for from me not every single thing because i only have so much time to do that we'll do another book but this one is a lot of those things in a book so go to the link in the description click on it go pre-order get that done papa love you papa kiss you so much work has gone into this and i know you're gonna love it very much okay now that we've done that don't forget to pre-order the book i know i've said it a million times but let's talk about this big mac if you don't know the big mac it's literally just a burger with an extra bun in the middle and makes it tall or it makes it appear to be tall it seems that every time you actually order a big mac you're like oh that's like that's about a tenth of the size that i expected for some reason because it's just not that big it's not that exciting it's got way too much clout and we're here to just we're here to shake things up there's not much else i need to say of course we're gonna make all the buns from scratch but this time we're using sesame seeds which i know i've said as a no-no without further ado let's do this one shall we back at me who doesn't love a good old-fashioned mac now that's a lunchtime powerhouse right there yeah you're gonna be powering your way through the toilet hi uh can i get a big mac thank you did you see the skill she didn't even look she was just like it's just like she's done that should be on that so we've got the bag i see that they've decided to finally fix their design after we've complained about it many times on this channel coincidence absolutely not i see what they did it wasn't the bag that they fixed because then they put it on here big mom oh big mac sorry i didn't see it because you designed this like by the way let me just make a quick point because i know i'm being mean but this is a billion dollar company billions of dollars to make this as good as possible so that's why i'm not very nice about it it's not like one person is like i worked on that this is like a 30 person job now i'm annoyed now i don't even need this yo come on what is this their website starts off with mouth-watering perfection this smells like the bathroom of in and out i really don't want to swallow got this one in the bag boys alright folks if you've been around here and we want to fully flex on mickey d's then you know we're making our own buns if you will here's a little refresher on how i make this hokkaido style burger bun the most important thing is a tang zong it's basically a thick roux that helps bring a little more spring and fluff to your bread it's very easy in a small saucepan add 2 tablespoons or 18 grams of all-purpose flour whisk in a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of whole milk and 2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters of water whisk it till smooth put that on the stove over medium heat and let that cook while stirring occasionally until it thickens which literally only takes like 30 to 60 seconds then just scoop your goop and place it to the side next in a container add half a cup or 120 milliliters of whole milk and half a cup plus 2 tablespoons or 150 milliliters of water heat that so it's about 95 degrees fahrenheit then mix in one and a half tablespoons or 21 grams of granulated sugar then whisk in two and a half teaspoons or eight grams of instant yeast and let that sit until it gets nice and fruity now snag a stand mixer and in the bowl add three and a half cups or 525 grams of bread flour in two teaspoons or seven grams of fine sea salt give it a little toss turn your mixture on a medium low and add all of your yeasty milky froth your tang zong which now looks like a weird gelatinous hockey puck one whole egg and one egg yolk let that mix for about two to three minutes or until it begins to form a smooth dough then add three tablespoons or 42 grams of softened unsalted butter one tablespoon at a time emphasis on softened if it's hard it won't incorporate into the dough and papa have a really big set anyway let that mix until the dough is a smooth boy plop that dough out of the stand mixer roll it into a light ball and place it in a greased bowl cover with plastic wrap be sure to give him a soul and a name that truly exudes respect and regality and let it rise at room temp for one hour or until and doubled now love your little dough man respect him and then release him from this world from whence he came be sure to degas it nicely and place your dough onto an unfloured counter divided into eight to nine equal pieces depending on how big you want them roll each piece of dough into a nice toit ball and place those all evenly spaced apart on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper i gave these a little extra breathing room and put the remaining dough balls on a separate baking sheet now cover those with another inverted rim baking sheet and let that proof at room temp for 30 minutes then just brush each of your buns with egg wash which is literally just one beaten egg with a splash of water then just give all of those a beautiful with sesame seeds look i know i said i was against them but maybe that was an overstatement there's a time and a place and this is a must today anyway bake those at 375 fahrenheit with convection ideally for 17 minutes or until deep golden brown and gorgeous now pull those puppies out and immediately brush them with melted butter and let them cool on a wire rack completely [Music] this here is a culmination of all my secret recipes that will never ever be released anywhere else but this book that's not actually in the book that was a complete lie i made that up the only way you're going to find out what's in the book is for you to pre-order link is in the description thank you so much click all right okay we have papa's buns now let's talk sauce not just any sauce our more exciting big mac sauce start off with half a cup or 120 grams of mayonnaise 3 tablespoons or 42 grams of ketchup look technically they don't use ketchup in there from what i understand but i don't care and this makes it significantly better in my opinion three tablespoons are 42 grams of yellow mustard one finely diced bread and butter pickle like the whole pickle not a slice with a splash of its juice an eighth of a teaspoon of onion powder three tablespoons of brunoise which is just an ultra fine dice of sweet onion one clove of grated garlic season that bad boy to taste with salt and pepper give it some whiskey business until thoroughly combined and that's it i mean look at this stuff i'd like to jump off and take a little bath or maybe not maybe that's a little too far why do i say these things okay we're almost there let's just get our toppings put together snack some iceberg lettuce you only need half a head because for some reason half a head produces like 4 000 kilos shave that nice and thin so you get little iceberg ribbons place it into a bowl along with optionally a small handful of fresh italian parsley that's been finely chopped in the zest from one lemon look i like to add the urban zest just to give it a little bit of freshness the ocean now toss all that together and that's your lettuce component if you want onion please slice that beauty super duper razor thin but most importantly give them a nice rinse under cold water after slicing this will help reduce some of their bite and any bitterness and leave a fragrant delicious and sweet onion flavor plus it improves the crunch so uh what are you doing brother wash your dang onions okay it's assembly time first thing get two buns of those you're gonna cut one of them in half and then the other you're going to cut just a round slice that's the same thickness as one of your bun halves so you get that three tier effect you know the procedure toast your buns in butter in a pan kinda like your grilled cheese until roasty toasty and lovely on all cut sides for the burger patty i'd recommend fattier ground beef i prefer something sub 80 lean personally and this is why grinding your own is always going to win it's not just about flexing okay it's sometimes it's about flexing anyway you'll need two pounds separate that into eight evenly sized balls and please make sure your balls are nice and round get a pan that's been lightly greased with oil get it screaming hot over medium-high heat then place a ball into the center you should immediately hear sizzle get a real big spatula the link for this one is in the description and press it down using the back of the spoon so it's nice and flat a little over a quarter of an inch thick and slightly wider than your buns because it will shrink a touch now season that generously with salt and pepper and let that sear for one to two minutes or until a rich crisp brown flip and oh my lord that burgers here has me on a one-way train too i'm about to bust down anyway season the other side generously with salt and pepper and let that sear for one more minute place to the side and repeat with the other patty now the moment you've all been waiting for all right let's just do this add a cheese slice of your choice to both the bottom bun and the middle bun i have one slice of aged cheddar and one slice of american only for the nostalgia towards the big mac give those a nice melt under the broiler or with a kitchen torch now to the bottom button add your lettuce followed by your sweet onion a generous dollop or two of your sauce you're crisp fatty patty then to the middle button again add your lettuce your paper thin crisp sweet onion and optionally you can add pickles but if you do please make sure that they're sliced lengthwise all right anyway add more sauce than your other burger patty add more sauce to the top of the patty yes i want this then grab the top bun and you know what needs to be done crown your king now look at this drippy absolute gentleman of a burger we killed it with the looks now let's see how we did with the taste we might as well just walk away they call it the big mac this is a normal burger this this is a big mac big macs are big it sounds big it sounds like a truck yeah uh two four six eight oh we're coming on down the road yet he's got a big one it's one of the big macs yep there comes the challenge of figuring out how to eat this oh my god look at this this is what i'm about to bite don't you want to bite that oh mama we won thank you so much i really have nothing to say other than the fact that for one this is a burger this tastes like a burger the buns it's buttery the meat is rich and fatty and beefy you can really taste the and you've got the two kinds of cheese the american cheese and the smoky gouda the onions have been washed so they've just retained their sweetness and oniony flavor but it's not overly bitey this is a burger this is really big vikram is gonna be our decider for the day number one wow big man all right get on with it number two oh my god number one number one is yours and the winner this is massive and massively delicious and this was get this underwear out of here it's kind of like wearing underwear on your face not that i would know what that's like but anyway we won but better episode it doesn't even matter because this is the big map the one thing you should take away from this is make your own buns make your own buns and you too could have one of the greatest big mac burgers sorry the greatest big mac burger that has ever lived you want to know what else is full of multi-tiered towers of juicing meat b-roll [Music] guys and that is it so we made the big mac but better the cookbook is out this is just such a momentous moment it's a special time all right i'm very excited about this we absolutely killed this recipe it was insane would i do this again and make a big mac again honestly i see the middle bun as a completely purposeless addition and it just makes it look really cool but you don't need to include the third little extra bun in the middle and it is going to be just as good it's it's not that special all right so again the cookbook is out please visit the link in the description pre-order your copy you gotta pre-order now it's more important to pre-order than to buy it when it comes out i'm just being honest with you so i hope to see you there in the link in the description but with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] yeah you

in the description and the first 100 people who do will get 50 off their first order and yes free shipping is included now coffee and funnel kicks aside let's make this shall we okay since funnel cake making is easy i'm going to give you three options the traditional powdered sugar version a churro funnel cake with salted caramel and sort of a toaster shreddle inspired funnel cake but before all that let's talk batter starting with two cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour add two and a half tablespoons or 34 grams of granulated sugar one teaspoon or seven grams of fine sea salt one teaspoon or five grams of baking powder give that some good old-fashioned whiskey business snag a large bowl crack in two whole eggs boop bap whisk those together till homogeneous then whisk in one and a quarter cup or 295 milliliters of whole milk or non-dairy milk then just whisk in your flour mixture until smooth and thoroughly combined that's it that's your batter and all these are technically funnel cakes and done in well a funnel it'd be a whole lot smarter and a whole lot cooler if you instead put your batter into squirt bottles and then cut their spouts to be a half inch wide you'll see why in a second get yourself a heavy bottom dutch oven that's at least five quarts fill that bad boy up with around two inches of vegetable oil heat that to 375 fahrenheit or 190 celsius once it's up to temperature and your body feels ready get your squirt bottle and squeezing it using even pressure start from the center of your oil and go around and around sort of making a spiral all the way out to the edge of the pie see how easy this is with the square bottle just important tips from papa at that point if you want more cake just squirt in a zigzag back and forth to help close the circle a little bit then just let that bad boy fry for one to two minutes or until golden brown give it a flip and fry again for another one to two minutes then using a spider fish that out of the oil then drain on a wire rack set over a baking sheet now from here you'll immediately dust it generously with powdered sugar while it's still hot so the sugar adheres and almost melts a little and once it's done look at that almost like some sort of winter wonderland rained down on a nightmare forest of branches weird uh comparison but something about this is a little scary okay we're done with mr traditional and you know how to make your funnel cake base so let's do our naughty churro version first let's start with our salted caramel in a medium saucepan add one cup or 210 grams of granulated sugar a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of water give that a light mix just to hydrate the sugar then place that over medium heat just until the sugar begins to dissolve slightly increase the heat and let that come to a boil then just let that broth boil and as soon as it reaches an amber color whisk in 5 tablespoons or 70 grams of salted butter keep whisking until the butter is fully emulsified and incorporated cut off the heat and whisk in half a cup or 120 milliliters of heavy whipping cream and an optional splash of vanilla extract once that's combined pour in a heat proof container and let that cool just to warm now for the cinnamon sugar aka one of the greatest culinary creations of all time simply combine in a bowl half a cup or 125 grams of light brown sugar one cup or 210 grams of granulated sugar and one and a half tablespoons or 11 grams of ground cinnamon whisk it together until thoroughly incorporated and that's papa's magic dust and by magic dust i mean it makes things magical okay don't get it twisted alright assembly time you know what to do spiral and fry your funnel cakes flip and fry on the other side now pay close attention once the funnel cake is ready fish it out and let it drain sort of mid air nicely then immediately toss it into a large bowl with the cinnamon sugar and toss to coat generously while it's still piping hot if it's not hot the sugar won't stick and papa will be disappointed now just pop that little cheerio man onto a plate optional hit it with some whipped cream followed by a nice drizzle of your salted caramel sauce as much or as little as you like and isn't she lovely seeing this churro funnel cake is like seeing the love of your life waiting for you at a park bench on a beautiful day in switzerland or something next up we have our toaster strudel inspired one hear me out this might be the best of the three but who knows let's start with our strawberry jam remove the tops from two pounds of strawberries then cut all of them in half some in quarters if they're monstrous in size place those into a medium sauce pot then add two and a half cups or 525 grams of granulated sugar yes it's a lot please relax anyway toss that to coat and let that sit for five minutes until it starts to get loosey juicy place in the stove over medium high then add two tablespoons of lemon juice and let that brother release its juices come up to a boil and cook and reduce for about 15 minutes mashing occasionally with a masher and once that's reduced nicely and has a jam-like texture when spread on a plate it's done now pour that finished jam into a blender and blend on high just until smooth and pass that through a fine mesh sieve or shinhawa to get a beautifully smooth and luxurious strawberry jam for a cream cheese frosting in a large bowl plop in one eight ounce block of full fat cream cheese softened to room temperature begin beating that on high speed with a handheld blender until smooth then beat in half a cup of unsalted fully softened butter until beautifully combined and emulsified then beat in three cups or 350 grams of confectioners sugar a little at a time because this stuff is very annoying to work with then once your sugar is added and you've beaten it until very smooth add one teaspoon or four grams of vanilla extract and an optional small pinch of fine sea salt if needed then beat until beautifully smooth and voluptuous it's so creamy okay back to the drill fry your funnel cake flip fry the other side drain and let it cool slightly then place it on a plate dress it beautifully in your strawberry jam to your heart's desire and finally pipe on a nice generous spiral of your cream cheese frosting in a totally optional light dusting with strawberry powder whoa whoa what what josh yeah just like blend freeze dried strawberries until you get a powder and sift it on top and yes it makes a huge visual and flavor difference now that we're done with our spiral cakes of happiness and joy let us taste test so we have our traditional powdered sugar woogie a churro version i mean come on what more do you want and we have essentially a strawberry cream cheese cake if you will mr traditional oh it's got some crunch instant nostalgia yeah it tastes traditional but it's a little better because obviously we made it and you can make it as thick or as thin as you want now this on the other hand this i'm very excited for i have no words every funnel cake should be this funnel cake homies whoever makes funnel cakes anywhere this is the new funnel cake you got the caramel and the cream it all sort of becomes an amalgamation in your mouth the flavor and texture cinnamony sweet creamy this is an eating experience i haven't tried this yet hold up holy this is actually really good oh my god these two are blessing look this is delicious it's great if you make it at home but it still has that sort of like traditional flavor that you're going to expect aside from the fact that you can control the batter's flavor but these two you've got to just drum it up a little bit make it fancy make it special this is the way you do it or go mr traditional at the end of the day the choice is yours make your own cake you want to know what else is full of big round cakes covered in papa's goodness [Music] b-roll [Music] so all right guys and that is it so we made our funnel cakes really

How you going to do Nashville like that?! Papa will not allow it. 

Nashville Hot Chicken...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, we've defeated kfc before and now they think they can enter a coveted nashville arena we'll see about that [Music] okay so we've seen this all over the internet on tick tock and all the other social media places it's very popular right now and it's also extremely annoying especially for those that are from nashville they're probably sitting back in their seats like wait a minute what the damn hell is that hey nashville and they're right they are right to be angry because you know what it could be so much better and not only better but more proper if you will i've gone to nashville and had the hot chicken and i've made it before and gotten it as close as i possibly can and i know that there's a certain level of respect that must be paid so we're going to do that today so with all that said let's make this shall we oh my god i can't believe there's a line right now why ah okay so we had to actually go to a different one we were waiting for like 12 minutes and we didn't move at all so we've made it to another one becky papa john's yeah or uh kfc i suspect this is probably going to taste good is it going to taste as good as it could doubt it hello i heard she'd be like i was like huh and then she's like what the you want damn i just want some chicken i'm afraid i'm scared oh me thank you so much appreciate it sir you as well well that was not my most favorite experience so we've got the bag at least they put it in plastic bags so my car doesn't get this is what everyone's all crazy about on tick tock all the tick tock people are like oh my god they gave me ranch if you are from nashville i know you are in pain right now you have to be everyone's saying that these are like the crispiest on the planet that sound crispy to you it smells like pickle wow this is awful this is not nashville hot chicken the texture of the chicken this is like a thick rubber band hardly spicy at all let's taste the oil in the bottom this has no flavor i mean anyone from nashville has to eat this and immediately be like what the hell is this broth this is not proper i have someone who's eaten this before and doesn't think it's that bad that's all i need to know i just want to make sure that we didn't just get an unusually terrible background just get some of that flavorless oil yeah flavorless taste about how it's supposed to god bless thank you so much dj i love you so much enjoy that nashville homies look we can redeem this okay hot chicken is splendidly simple and easy don't over complicate it you got the crispy chicken you got the spicy oil let's get this rolling since for some reason we're making tenders you're gonna start off with five to six chicken breasts cut those in half lengthwise to get two tenders depending on their size you may need to cut them into thirds but use your common sense try to tell me you don't know what an appropriate tender looks like separately mix together 2 tablespoons or 30 grams of kosher salt and 2 teaspoons or 5 grams of msg kfc uses it so we're using it too no man if i do mix those together until thoroughly combined then season all of your chicken bobbies generously with your msg salt on all sides then cover those with plastic wrap and let them cure in the fridge for at least one hour or overnight look technically you can skip the cure entirely but doing it really helps the seasoning penetrate the chicken so if you want to penetrate it that would be how you do it now to make your chicken dredge get a large bowl and add 3 cups or 450 grams of all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon or 8 grams of smoked paprika one tablespoon or eight grams of garlic powder two teaspoons or five grams of ground white pepper two teaspoons or five grams of onion powder one tablespoon or ten grams of kosher salt getting lot hated and two teaspoons or six grams of give this some whiskey business until thoroughly combined and place to decide and make your butt milk dip by adding two large eggs whisk those together until nice and homogeneous then whisk in 2 cups or 475 milliliters of buttermilk also known as butt milk to me see that's where it gets the name from three tablespoons are 45 milliliters of hot sauce this is crystal hot sauce but you can use whatever your sweet little baby heart desires and two tablespoons or 30 milliliters of pickle juice optionally you can sprinkle it with some of your msg salt leftover from when we were seasoning our chicken bobbies and now you have your dippy little man and your dredge next heat up a heavy bottom pot with at least two and a half inches of vegetable oil to 335 fahrenheit or 170 celsius now while that's heating before we bread or fry let's get our hot oil spices ready in a heat proof bowl add four tablespoons or 35 grams of cayenne powder one tablespoon or eight grams of smoked paprika one tablespoon or eight grams of garlic powder one tablespoon or ten grams of kosher salt one tablespoon or seven grams of msg and two tablespoons or 30 grams of packed brown sugar whisk all that together until thoroughly combined and place it to the side okay the breading process is real simple all right it's not rocket science it's uh chicken science yeah i first like to drizzle a couple of tablespoons of my dipping liquid into the dredge mixture while stirring vigorously to get tiny little nuggies in the breading for that good old-fashioned flakiness and i would highly recommend that you do the same otherwise maybe papa no kiss who knows maybe papa no share the chicken with you anyway to dredge first coat of chicken breast with the flour mixture thoroughly no wet spots okay shake off the excess then give it a nice little bath to thoroughly coat in the buttermilk mixture and finally back into the flour pressing the dredge aggressively into the chicken to give it a nice thick coat and make sure to coat every little crevice because again no kiss from papa if there's a bald chicken area once that's nicely coated transfer to a baking sheet coated with flour and repeat with all of your chicken oh look at the coated little men let's take them to the fiery pits of fried oil to fry carefully lay three to four pieces of your chicken into your hot oil away from you unless you want to splash yourself with the oil which is uh not recommended please don't do that and fry for anywhere between six to eight minutes or until golden brown crisp and the interior is fully cooked which should be 165 fahrenheit internal temperature now this next bit is crucial as you pull your chicken out of the hot oil place it under wire rack to drain just for a few seconds and immediately whisk one and a half cups or 350 milliliters of your hot frying oil yes the one that you fried the chicken in into your spicy oil mixture once that's whisked together and thoroughly combined dunk your freshly fried chicken into the hot oil immediately to thoroughly coat and place in a wire rack to drain off the excess you want the spicy oil and the chicken to be hot when you coat it otherwise it will make your chicken go soggy then simply repeat this process with all of your chicken frying beautifully draining slightly then dunking and totally coating with your beautifully fragrant borderline sensual spicy oil and allow to drain that's it that's the natural hot chicken and yes the spicy oil will stay hot enough through the whole frying process fear not papa's got you anyway to assemble your meaty spicy boys stick to tradition get a plate laid on a nice slice of white bread yes the high blood sugar-inducing kind two gorgeous pieces of luxuriously crispy hot chicken really let that spicy oil leak into the pillowy bread papa looks so spicy for my tum tum but also so yum yum add two pickle coins or more should your heart desire it and that's our plate now looking at these two i already know which one i would pick but now we need to taste test and decide who really won well you know visually as vikram previously stated hey yo why this look like a shrimp thank you we won that's all i have to say we just disrespected these people they're not people they're chimpkins there's heat it's not too spicy it's salty it's rich the chicken is so moist it's got multiple layers of just flavor brother and that's the whole point of a nashville hot chicken it should cradle you like you're this little chickeny child this left you in the crib bro okay it's taste test time so we gotta shuffle first oh no no no no just turn it there yep and then eat it come on sweetie oh my god number two ah okay it's pretty clear it's clear from the first bite yours was the first one yours is better i mean i said it looks like shrimp but it kind of tastes like shrimp too i taste like a fishy sub note in there i don't know why a fishy sub note i'm not covering that this tastes good but it has no flavor this actually has like the skin of this has like the spice and the depth i feel like and whereas this doesn't it's not a nashville chicken but better we win everything you want to know what else has hot spicy breasts of chicken i mean b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our kfc nashville hot chicken which is really we just ended up making nashville hot chicken let's be honest we paid homage we gave it some love it was actually spicy as it should be it was unbelievably crunchy and you know what i'm sorry you can't beat a proper nashville hot chicken especially if it's made in nashville shout out to hattie bees by the way that's my favorite place to go look i'm not saying that the kfc version wasn't good at all i'm just saying that it wasn't nearly as good as it should have been and it just doesn't pay the love that nashville deserves nashville deserves it brother so nonetheless we won we killed this one it was perfect delicious i recommend that you make it as always if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] you

Finally getting around to making enchiladas, although not...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, you know they say with great power comes great responsibility and i'm giving you this tex-mex guide you better dog gone find some responsibility okay so we're finally making enchiladas brother please understand that these are not ultra traditional they are tex mex i've said it several times i know a lot of people are going to get mad there's a lot of people that are protective over their cuisine totally get it so this recipe kind of makes me think of like the wild west cows being roped standoffs big burly dudes with cowboy boats i'll stop doing that now who knows maybe i'll be that man for you of course this originates with a classic mexican dish which then intertwined with southern texas cuisine which created the mashup of the tex-mex enchilada so of course we'll be making these with respect to tradition but also with a texas culinary twang a beautiful cultural blend that combines both texts and mechs but you want to know what's better than combining two amazing things you guessed it bundling your home and car insurance so that's where today's episode sponsor geico comes in combining your home and car insurance could save you even more so for bundling made easy visit gecko.com today and head to the link in the description to see how much you can save so with all that said let's make this shall we okay folks we have two tex-mex options for you today the classic cheesy enchiladas and a verde chicken enchilada let's begin with the cheese because that's papa's favorite let's first begin with our chili dip snag and optionally deseed 7 guajillo chilies 2 ancho chilis and 2 dried chipotle chilies place this in a medium sized sauce pot and cover with water bring that to a boil over medium high then reduce to a simmer and let it go for 10 to 15 minutes or until these guys are very soft and maybe a little too hot for papa this time they should tear easily though fish those out with a spider and place those into a blender along with three cloves of garlic which i rough chop for some reason completely unnecessary begin blending that on high speed and add your cooking liquid about a quarter cup at a time until it's very smooth and reaches a consistency something like this right here from there grab yourself 12 corn tortillas give one a dunk in your chili sauce on both sides to coat lightly and place on a plate then simply repeat that process with each tortilla stacking the tortillas on top of each other to create a nice little tower sort of a spicy tower except it's not really that spicy now just let those sit for about 25 minutes at room temp while you're waiting let's make our tex-mex chili gravy technically not traditional but it's traditional in the world of well tex-mex enchiladas like i said a mix of tradition but all right we'll just leave it at that actually start by blending one sweet onion with seven cloves of garlic until you get a smooth paste add that to a small saucepan bring that up over medium heat then once it begins to simmer lower the heat to low and let it simmer for 30 minutes or until thickened next cut up three slices of bacon into half inch lardons toss that into a large cold pan heat that over medium heat then let those cook stirring often until they start to give up their gosh darn smoky fat and let them fry in their own fat until deeply browned and crisp drain those on a paper towel and let them cool slightly then finely chop into a crumble you'll notice i do this a lot with some sauces and that's because papa knows something anyway to your remaining pork fat add a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of vegetable oil heat that over medium heat until shimmering then sprinkle in half a cup or 75 grams of all-purpose flour whisk all that together and let your flour cook out while whisking constantly until it reaches a golden color and begins to toast lightly from there add two and a half tablespoons or eight grams of texas style chili powder not just any chili powder okay the one with like the cumin and the stuff and all that stuff mixed in one tablespoon or five grams of smoked paprika one and a half teaspoons or three grams of ground cumin and three quarters of a teaspoon or one gram of cayenne powder whisk all that together and let that cook just until fragrant about 15 seconds add in your onion garlic paste incorporate that brother then gradually whisk in two and a half cups or 590 milliliters of beef stock which was heated up on the side not mandatory but you know heating it up helps incorporate it easier continue mixing and heating and if it's still too thick keep adding beef stock until it reaches a consistency somewhat gravy-like like this not like this this is a little too poop once it's reached the correct consistency season that the taste with salt and that's your gravy all right almost ready to assemble first grab yourself a good old biation ten inch cast iron skillet or deep pan add in one cup or 240 milliliters of vegetable oil let that heat over medium heat until it reaches 350 fahrenheit then once hot add in your tortillas one at a time and fry for two to three seconds per side you want this to be quick you're only doing it to form a skin but you still want it to be let me express something to you this is very important do not skip if you don't do this your enchiladas will fall apart and papa no share his enchilada with you once all your tortillas are fried we're ready to assemble add on some shredded oaxacan cheese then add a layer of shredded cheddar cheese hey you know the more the merrier don't be scared then roll that up into a tube and close the cheese in an envelope of chili soaked glove place it into a 9x13 baking dish seam side down and repeat with all of your stuffed tortillas aligning your enchiladas side by side lengthwise until you fill the whole pan now just give this a generous dressing with your tex-mex gravy more cheddar cheese followed by shredded oaxaca cheese then pop those bad boys into an oven set to 375 fahrenheit for about 15 minutes or until the liquid is bubbling and the cheese is just melted no color though then pull that out let it cool slightly hit it with some crumbled cotija cheese optionally in fresh cilantro leaves then observe the cheese pole pop that onto a plate then just dig your knife in and go into a cheesy chili rich corn tortilla fever dream that'll have you talking like your elders reminiscing about the past we have tex-mex style cheese enchiladas now this is not to be confused with new mexico style where it's stacked and not to be confused with the chili version all those things this is tex-mex so for all the purists there's your okay so you cut you lift you cheese pull we're just going to the sky how far can we go oh about that far i'm at a loss for words it's cheesy there's a nice chew to the cheese it's melted but it's not just goopy and obviously there's a nice spice enchilada sauce is anxious and rich and chili forward the tortillas that soaked in that original chili sauce that we and then fried that actually comes through really nicely and it blends with the cheese perfect this is a perfect tex mex style enchilada without a doubt you can't have the cheese without the chicken verde so we're gonna make that next first let's make our verde sauce in a medium sauce pot add one pound of tomatillos that have been peeled cleaned and halved cover that with water place in the stove over medium high bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer and let that cook for five minutes or until just soft now while that's going heat a large skillet over medium-high and add just enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan about two and a half tablespoons cut the top off of a sweet onion then quarter it but leave a little bit of the root on each quarter peel the first outer layer off then add them to your screaming hot pan and let that sear for one to two minutes or until you get a nice roasty char flip and repeat on each side so they're looking gorgeous now fish out all of your tomatillos place into a bowl cut off the roots of your onion add that to the bowl well not the root ends those can go not in your mouth thank you add your onions and tomatillos to a blender along with seven cilantro stems five cloves of garlic three serrano chilis with their stems removed you better leave them seeds in there unless you're a little baby oh my gosh josh is it too spicy for me it's okay papa forgives anyway blend that bad boy on high speed until completely smooth season to taste with salt pour it into a bowl and that is your salsa verde for the chicken aspect i'll make it real easy season 2 pounds of boneless and skinless chicken thighs with whichever seasoning you choose heat up a large pan over medium high fill the pan with just enough oil to coat the bottom about three tablespoons and once the oil is shimmering in hot sear your chicken for two minutes per side or until a beautiful golden brown you don't need to cook them all the way through yet we're just getting color but do be sure to see her in bashes to avoid overcrowding then once your chicken is all seared toss everything back into the pan cover with one and a half cups of chicken stock or beef stock bring that to a boil then reduce the heat to low cover with the lid or in this case foil because i lost the lid to this as well and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked now remove all the chicken place into a bowl turn the heat on the pan back up to medium high and boil that liquid and reduce until it's reduced by about 85 percent and begins to thicken then turn off the heat and whisk in two tablespoons of unsalted butter until incorporated and emulsified i mean come on that looks pretty dang good now shred all of your chicken either with forks or a hand blender which apparently works doesn't seem right then season your chicken with your chicken glaze you know the one you just made to taste toss it all together and that's your luscious chicky man now look assembly at this point is the same dip 12 corn tortillas in your salsa verde this time let them sit for 10 to 15 minutes then fry them in your oil for two to three minutes per side you know really make them nice okay don't skimp on me then from there just fill them with some chicken followed by oaxacan cheese roll that bad boy up place in a 9x13 baking dish and then repeat with the rest of your cheeky wiki yeah this time once your pan is lined up you're going to top it with your salsa verde as much or as little as you like followed by some shredded oaxaca cheese pop that into a 375 degree oven and let that bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese is just melted but not browned from there pull your little man out of the oven hit it with a generous drizzle of sour cream plenty of crumbled cotija cheese very thinly sliced red onion first cilantro leaves and thinly sliced fresh jalapenos i mean look at this this looks like a forest but i just want to dive head first in with my mouth a gap so this is the chicken tex-mex verde salsa enchilada we got the tortilla we got the sauce with the tomatillo the sour cream and oaxacan cheese or you can do mozzarella or whatever white cheese you want a little bit of cotija on top red onions fresh jalapenos and cilantro now [Music] you ever go and get a chicken enchilada regardless of variety and they use chicken breast and it's horrifically overcooked and you take a bite it's just like sawdust this this is what i like to call this has everything you want on it this is not overly heavy like the cheese one is that is the benefit of this it's got acidity it's got balance it's got chew but if i had to pick my favorite it probably would be the cheese enchilada because it's really yummy at the end of the day the choice is yours the point is that i just want you to make it just go give it a little shot try the cheese the cheese if you do the cheese one that's the easier one because you don't have to make chicken before that okay turn the camera stuff i don't have anything else to say you want to know what else makes you dream of cheese oozing out of a tube papa made b-roll all right guys and that is it so before we say anything thank you again to geico for sponsoring today's episode we love you we kiss you papa they're helping you with my culinary journey around the united states and they want to help you too just you know instead of food they just want to help you with your home and car insurance so head to the link in the description to visit geico.com today now let's talk enchiladas we made them we ate them they were delicious it was beautiful we cried we laughed we bathed in enchilada sauces it also made me think about the traditional versions that are out there you know the ones with lots of guajillo chili that are then rehydrated and blended and that's the only sauce that they use that's hyper traditional but i gotta say you've got to make room for this there's something nostalgic about it maybe it's because i grew up with it as a kid but this is one of those recipes where you just can't knock it till you try it it's really good but of course i'm gonna vouch for my own recipe because obviously i must protect my ego but with all that said if you

Can we make them completely homemade and dare I say.... much...much...,2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, i didn't want to have to go back after them it's one of my favorites i love in and out but can we all just agree that their fries are not that good so we're going after the king of their fries and i think there might just be a new king in town [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today we're making the in-n-out animal style fries look let me just lay out some groundwork all they are is literally french fries that are then covered with american cheese slices caramelized onions burger sauce or their spread that is it that's what you'd be blessing about so we're going to do everything we know with our culinary techniques put them together and make something that is better and let me tell you something i think it's going to be better now with all that said let's make this shall we we're in houston and the closest in and out was 30 minutes away so we're just gonna try it here oh my god there's a lime uh can i just do one order of animal style fries thank you thank you too i didn't realize they were gonna give it to me like this that smells good though now we're gonna go eat it we're eating it here fresh because we're so far away all right i'm trying to be fair here well for one they always lose in the fry department i mean look at this your fry should not do this the cheese actually isn't melted it's totally solid hello it's literally slices of american cheese melted on top of soggy french fries camelman might onions that aren't even fully caramelized the burger sauce is solid it's like one of the best in the world the biggest problem is that it turns into one giant mass i've said it before i'm a california boy right i'm from l.a i love in-n-out i'm a big fan i always have been but of their burgers their fries have always lacked the crazy thing is is i'm talking all this mess about it being soggy and the cheese not being melted enough we literally we from in and out 30 seconds later i'm eating it like in and out is right there so before anyone's like oh josh will you probably let it sit shut up we're gonna go back through the drive-through i'm gonna order everything separate so we can reassemble it and heat it back up there and then do the side-by-side taste test because papa is merciful right so here we are these fries are comprised of four main components the fries obviously the sauce the american cheese except we're doing something a little different because we're oh and the caramelized onions first let's prep our fries we're gonna need three to four russet potatoes nice and plump peel those bad boys and cut them into batons about the size of well a french fry i actually like using this machine so they're geometrically perfect and because it's the same one that in and out uses i believe and there's a link in the description for that if you want one now once all those bad boys are cut give them a quick rinse drain the water then cover them completely so they are submerged with cold water season that water generously with salt and let them sit at room temp for 1 hour or up to 8 hours in the refrigerator and while that's going let's make our caramelized onions you'll need 2 to 3 large sweet onions cut off their tops then slice them in half peel those brothers then just give them a medium-ish dice ideally you want to keep them uniform but they don't need to be perfect look it's not rocket science it's science next get a medium-sized pot and add 3 tablespoons or 42 grams of unsalted butter heat that over medium heat until the butter is totally melted and bubbling then add your onions season that a taste with salt plus a small pinch of sugar give that a mix to coat with the butter and then simply let that cook over medium heat stirring often for about 45 minutes or so now look don't get all freaked out okay no panicking you're just gonna be slowly alternating the heat from medium to low so the onions don't char stirring every so often so the onion get coaxed into first a blonde then a little darker to a tan then to a brown all the way until they're a pretty deep caramelized color i like them dark not burnt just deeply caramelized you may need to add a splash of water here and there as you're cooking them if they start to get too dry once they're done they should look like this now that you have the we can make our incredibly important sauce this is everything so don't skip any of these ingredients here now start with three quarters of a cup or 175 grams of mayonnaise half a cup or 120 grams of ketchup a quarter cup or 80 grams of dijon mustard followed by two dill pickles that have been finely diced evenly one tablespoon or seven grams of thinly sliced chives one tablespoon or 14 milliliters of worcestershire sauce and two cloves of garlic grated season the taste with salt and pepper give that some whiskey business until combined beautifully and finally stir in half of your caramelized onion this is a sauce to behold for fries sandwiches or heck even chicken dipping now at this point we're almost ready to make our fries but remember i know like just plain old american cheese so we're gonna instead make a mornay sauce which is essentially a fancy cheese sauce in a medium saucepan add two tablespoons or 28 grams of unsalted butter heat it over medium heat once it's completely melted and blue blend whisk in two tablespoons or 20 grams of all-purpose flour let that cook while continuously stirring for about 45 seconds then gradually whisk in one cup or 240 milliliters of warm milk now just keep heating and mixing that mixture until it begins to thicken remove it from the heat whisk in one cup or 90 grams of smoked cheddar half a cup or 50 grams of grated gruyere and half a cup or 40 grams of grated american cheese so you know you got a little bit of that nostalgia whisk all that in until completely incorporated and melted if you need to turn the heat back on you totally can just don't let it boil or anything then keep it in a warm area covered because this sauce is buoys okay it's fry time pull your fries out of their water and dry them off as well as possible with paper towels then heat a heavy bottom pot filled with about two and a half inches worth of fry oil heat that to 325 degrees fahrenheit or 160 celsius then in around two to three batches fry your fries for three to four minutes giving them a light turn in the middle of their cook time until they are cooked through and a pale blonde no color now remove those and drain on a fresh paper towel and repeat with the rest of your fry little men once that's done increase your heat to 375 degrees fahrenheit or 190 celsius and again in batches fry your fries this time for only two to three minutes or until they're a nice golden brown and ultra crisp pull them out using a spider let them drain a little bit then add them to a heat proof bowl and immediately season aggressively with salt while tossing this is important that you season while they're hot so that the salt sticks then immediately drain on a paper towel and repeat with the rest of your little fry men and that's it that is a beautifully delicious fuentuai right there now all we have left is our assembly be sure to reheat your cheese sauce so it's hot and in a liquid state you may need to add a splash of milk to loosen it up but anyway get yourself a bowl add in your hot fries hit it with a generous layer of your sauce or burger sauce if you want to call it that followed by a generous layer of your cheese sauce is little or as much as you want really honestly then of course your caramelized onion to your heart's desire now optionally you can top that with some thinly sliced chives and fresh torn parsley because it looks nice and tastes gemmy and that is a poised animal style fry right there look at this beauty i want to just cry eat cry again and then eat until all the sadness in the world disappears in my eyes so let's do that in the taste test this is all coming from an in-n-out stand i would consider myself an in-n-out stand and by that i mean i love their burgers now they're fries on the other hand just a little some onion let me just try one of their fries because it's been a second i made their fries better and it's still behind that's all i gotta say my sauce sauce and sauce no comparison this tastes like candy and i like their sauce compared to mine mine is like savory punchy rich my caramelized onion is actually caramelized and when i say caramelized i mean this is this this is just sauteed we need a taste tester tj it's been a while since you've been in here here's bite number one and here's bite number two it's a little bigger wow can you even guess there's some similarities but i'm gonna be honest with you chief the second one was yours yeah i honestly didn't hate that as much as i thought i was going to yep i still don't like it everything comes together in this this is just like why is this all together okay you heard it here we won but better in and out animal style fries this has been a highly requested one look at the end of the day what you're looking at before you are potatoes that are fried covered in cheese a burger sauce and caramelized onions let this be a lesson that technique over everything papa love you papa miss you and if you make this papa if you know make then papa you want to know what else is full of saucy hot fries ready to be shoveled into your mouth hole b-roll all right guys and that is it so we made our animal style fries but better they were better we won it was it was the easy one i mean this is one of my favorite burger sauces of all time i don't want to say the word perfected but i think we've gotten pretty close to perfecting our well in-n-out burger sauce our way with chives and all that good stuff cause you know how much i love chives everything melded together really nicely the cheese sauce was really the key to upgrading this a whole other level texturally it's better flavor-wise it's better there's more control you can use all sorts of cheeses in my opinion it looks a lot nicer with glossy cheese oozing all over it instead of a lifeless slice of american cheese so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will

It's the cured, smoked meat legend of every deli in the world that you're able to make this perfectly...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, oh we're going after the meat of all meats if you've never had a good pastrami it's about gosh darn time okay really quick i know this is not normal we're on the phone but i need to tell you something i was recently featured on one of the greatest episodes of the burger show of all time that's not an exaggeration i'm actually very excited about it it is live now please go to the description and go check it out uh we made the fanciest burger i've ever seen in my life was like a gastronomical burger so link in the description i'll see you there okay so today we're making pastrami which is basically corned beef that's then been seasoned and smoked i believe sort of kind of that's probably not a really good way to describe it it is the cured smoked meat legend of every deli in the world really this is like the substance of a reuben the rye bread the sauerkraut the russian dressing and fatty juicy pieces of pastrami that are just oozing and yummy and so good it's salty smoky it's got all these spices it's a beautiful thing and we're gonna make it completely from scratch and i'm gonna show you the whole darn thing so with all the said let's make this shall we okay so brisket can either be very easy or very hard depends on how you look at it partner anyway you're gonna begin with at least a five to six pound chunk of brisket here i have a whole brisket because i like to make big batches personally i find that wagyu is the best candidate for pastrami but prime should work just fine we're gonna start by separating the point from the flat oh my gosh josh what i'm just a wee baby not a butcher look take a deep breath papa believes in you you see that thicker end to the left that is the point to separate you're simply going to follow along with a large line of fat that runs in between both the flat and the brisket keep cutting and pulling peeling it back and as soon as it gets real thin you're then just gonna cut straight through to the bottom and pull them apart there you can see the flat on the right and the point on the left see real easy now once it's done you can trim any excess fat down to about a half inch clean these failures up and now we must to make that get a very large container this is a 12 quart cambro one of my favorites and the link for mine is in the description add three quarters of a cup or 156 grams of dark brown sugar eight ounces or 226 grams of kosher salt one tablespoon or seven grams of coriander seeds one tablespoon or thirteen grams of mustard seeds two teaspoons or six grams of cloves two teaspoons or 12 grams of prague powder number one this is a curing salt and you can get it on amazon the link for that will be in the description as well two teaspoons or eight grams of hot pepper flakes and four bay leaves crushed up okay oh there's more hang on two sprigs of rosemary that have been bruised five cloves of garlic that have been lightly crushed and finally five to seven juniper berries then simply add in one gallon of water stir that to mix until completely dissolved and that's your brine then all you gotta do is chuck your meat deeply into it don't be nasty you wanna make sure that this is completely submerged by the brine so if it's not get some plastic bags fill them with water and use that to weigh it down now just pop that into the refrigerator covered with a lid for six days you can flip it halfway through the brine if needed you'll know it's done once the meat is a pale tan or even gray now pull your meat out of its bath water place it to the side and before we smoke or season it i would highly recommend tossing your brine and replacing it with fresh water dropping your brine brisket into that water and let it sit in the fridge for an additional night to help desalinate it slightly just so it's not too salty but you know that's just papa's preference and as you know papa's preference is law around here so you probably should do it anyway once that's done it's time to talk about the smock that's a smoke pull your brisket out of the water and drain on a paper towel and be sure to dry it off real nicely with additional paper towels to make the pastrami spice snag a blender although you could totally do this in a mortar and pestle or a food processor and to that you're going to add one tablespoon or 11 grams of black peppercorns two and a half tablespoons or 10 grams of coriander seeds 2 teaspoons or 10 grams of mustard seeds give that a good old-fashioned bland brother into sort of a coarse chunky powder does that make sense i mean i don't want it quite powdery nor do i want it overly chunky pop it into a bowl and it should look something like this to that you're going to add 1.5 tablespoons or 26 grams of light brown sugar 1 tablespoon or 12 grams of onion powder 1 tbsp or 123 grams wait a minute that's not right who wrote this voice over oh wait i did 12 grams of garlic powder and 1 tablespoon or 8 grams of smoked paprika give that some whiskey [Music] until thoroughly combined and you've got your spice season your brisket generously with the spice all over on all sides give them a good old-fashioned rub down it's been a long day mr brisket you need to relax after your little bath anyway prep a smoker to 225 degrees fahrenheit and once the smoker is nice and hot and well smoking pop in your brisket and smoke that bad boy with heavy smoke for about six to seven hours or until you reach an internal temperature of 150 degrees fahrenheit then pop that fatty out of the smoker place the brisket on a baking sheet lined with a wire rack pour in about two to three cups of boiling water in the bottom of that tray and tightly cover it with foil being sure to avoid the foil touching the actual meat then pop it into an oven set to 325 fahrenheit and let that steam cook in the oven for another two hours or until the brisket reaches an internal temperature of 195 to 203 fahrenheit but to be honest the easiest way to tell if it's done is by spanking it go on now give them a little spank look at that jiggle lord have mercy on my soul because i'm about to buzz now wrap that bad boy in butcher's paper and let it rest for at least 15 to 20 minutes go crack open a cold one with the boys or something while you wait although at this point my guess is you've already been doing that all day so maybe just have a glass of water now if you plan on making a classy reuben you make a quick russian dressing by grabbing a medium bowl adding one cup or 210 grams of mayonnaise a third cup or 96 grams of ketchup two tablespoons or 32 grams of hot sauce this is crystal hot sauce two and a half teaspoons or 15 grams of worcestershire sauce that was pretty good i think i said it that time see if i can do it again worcestershire okay uh one teaspoon or three grams of smoked paprika two tablespoons of very thinly sliced chives one tablespoon of fresh grated horseradish and one clove of garlic also grated season it a taste with salt and pepper give it some whiskey business until thoroughly combined and that's your russian dressing now look you can enjoy this however you want but the brisket was so beautifully cooked to utter tenderness but i actually decided to slice it nice and thick and because i like them a little on the thick side i mean my lord it's juicing for us look at this thang thanging but hey to each of their own if you want it thin then slice it thin papa still geese you could put it sliced over roast potatoes chopped up atop some tortellini or whatever you want i decided to go the sandal route with some butter toasted sourdough bread both sides doused in that russian dressing honestly quite sporadically stacked pastrami but hey nice and tall and of course a decent layer of sauerkraut i forgot the swiss cheese whoops a daisy but it's still gemmy and of course the other sauced up half of bread crowning our king give it a nice slice in half to unveil its juicy cross section and now let us taste test both the unadulterated version and the sandal version to see if this was all worth it first off i just flung juice all over me and i'm happy about it this needed an extra day to cure this is why curing on time is important now we're on a short schedule so we had to pull it one day early so for all the curing masters out there who are like josh um not only that's done thank you make sure it's at least five days not four just by looking at this beautiful juicy tender ah let's give it a little taste i'm in a meadow smell a campfire it's in the distance this is probably one of the best i've ever had i'm not gonna lie but we gotta try it on a sandwich got the russian dressing this sauerkraut and we decided to use sourdough instead of rye i know that's a little sacrilegious but i mean that'd be doing some stuff this is a perfect sandwich in my opinion you have the toast the deep crunch you got the sweetness the sourness from the russian dressing a little more sourness from the sauerkraut and obviously you've got this rich fatty perfectly smoked perfectly brined pastrami this is busting respectfully [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] you want to know what else has papa's hot juicy meats juicing for you b-roll all right guys and that is it so we made our pastrami and it came out honestly perfectly i don't want to say that it's better than cats is i'm just saying that this could have been an attempt for a but better maybe okay maybe not i don't know it's up to you to decide that you got to try it yourself before you make any assumptions but all i have to say was very good perfectly juicy perfectly fatty perfectly tender sweet salty rich i mean this tasted like the pastrami of my dreams and hopefully it would for you too now obviously this is a long process you're grinding for several days you're smoking for several hours but you know what that's what it takes to make a good pastrami and if you can't get over that well then just buy it somewhere else to be completely honest with you but hey at least you know how to make it now so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] you

Chow Mein should be way better, and I have a feeling we are going to blow Panda Express out of the water...again.

Recipe: https://www.joshuaweissman.co...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, we're going back after panda express fellas we're going after an item that should just be way better and i have a feeling we're gonna blow it out of the [Music] [Applause] [Music] water [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today we're making the panda express chow mein butt better it's pretty simple it's chow mein noodles they're stir-fried with a couple vegetables and that's really it i don't think i've ever ordered chow mein before but a lot of you guys have asked for it so here we are making it we're gonna make it as properly as possible with a proper wake it's gonna be beautiful okay i think this is something uncle roger would probably appreciate i don't know maybe he's watching who knows now with all that said let's make this shall we oh my god it's panda yeah are people whipping it today why is it in houston that people just randomly get into this mood where they're like you know what i think just drive normally this drive-through line looks oh what should we do the driving world's here unfortunately we have to be behind people that has like their entire family in a cartoon on the back of their car no i get it like but also why and i mean this genuinely with respect nobody cares i i just don't know who's gonna be driving and they see that they're like oh my god you have two daughters and a cat hi uh can i just get two orders of just the chow mein thank you okay we have this really stinky and the boxes are closed oh god here we go okay we have the back these are already open so that's probably all over the bag now so we're just gonna eat it out of the bag look at i'm not i'm not even joking about this they didn't even try to close these i get it it's it's panda express right i'm not expecting michelin service but could you just close the box that smells awful how do i describe this smell burnt oil here we go they don't taste as bad as they smell but this has to be the most flavorless noodle i've put in my mouth in the last 10 years of my life and that's a fact what i taste is noodle a little bit of cabbage excessive amounts of vegetable oil and that's that's it if y'all think we can't make this better get the heck out of here we're gonna do it right now i literally have nothing else to say and that that's just this is it this is so fast it's gonna have you saying why in tarnation did i ever go and get this let's first begin with our chow mein sauce in a small bowl add 1 tablespoon or 14 milliliters of chinese cooking wine such as shaoxing two tablespoons or 30 milliliters of dark soy sauce one teaspoon or three grams of ground white pepper one and a half tablespoons or 25 grams of oyster sauce begin whisking that together and then realize that you forgot about the half teaspoon or three grams of toasted sesame oil give it some [Applause] until thoroughly combined then whisk in two teaspoons or five grams of cornstarch until completely dissolved that is your chow mein sauce looking lovely now before we put this all together i want to talk about our noodle like new dolls the other day i saw someone recommend fettuccine please understand that if you do this papa i can't even make a joke about this don't make chow mein if you're gonna act like that instead get yourself some fresh chow mein noodles i personally like the thicker noodles rather than the really thin ones and these can be found at most asian grocery stores usually in the refrigerated area you can also find them online and there's a link in the description for that now once you've acquired your nudes get a large pot of water bring the tube oil and add 8 to 10 ounces or 226 to 283 grams of noodles let that cook depending on what the package recommends mine only needed one single minute then drain those in a colander give it a light rinse with fresh water this helps remove the excess starch and stops the cooking process to prevent overcooking because if you overcook it then papa no smooch next snag a nice big wok not to be confused with the rhyme of a nice i'll stop now add in about three to half tablespoons of vegetable oil swirl it around the pan and heat over medium high swirling occasionally until the oil begins to smoke pour out that oil give it a good wipe with a paper towel and now you're lightly seasoned add in another three and a half tablespoons of fresh oil to your walk heat that back up over medium high and once the oil is hot hot and the oil is moving real fast you're gonna add two green onions which have been sliced into one inch segments one to two large ribs of celery sliced one large carrot peeled and julienned beautifully i used a julienne peeler which i normally don't do but hey here we are and three cups of very finely shredded green cabbage which is about half a head look please make the cabbage thin okay thin like paper now we have to give this what's called the breath of the wok rip the heat to high and begin vigorously pushing and pulling the pan while constantly stirring with a walk spatula or spoon do this for about 20 to 30 seconds then let the veg rest and get some color begin stir-frying again and repeat that process a couple of times until the veg has some nice color on it and is cooked but it still has some crunch about three minutes total then immediately remove all the veg and place in a bowl to the side add in another two tablespoons of vegetable oil heat that over medium high until very hot then add four cloves of very finely chopped garlic constantly swirl the pan while frying until the garlic begins to turn golden brown listen this will happen very quickly so keep a close eye and as soon as it hits a nice golden brown immediately add your veg back and stir together to keep the garlic from burning if it burns you ruined it what do you want me to say add in your noodles and fry over high heat for another minute then add your chow mein sauce followed by two tablespoons or 30 milliliters of water stir fry for another 30 seconds then add one cup or 120 grams of bean sprouts stir-fry for another 30 seconds cut off the heat then add two more cloves of very finely chopped garlic and toss together that way you get some fresh spicy garlic and some roasty toasty garlic flavors now all you gotta do is get yourself a nice bowl and immediately serve add stacks and stacks of your gorgeous noodles until it's nice and tall and optionally finished with some very thinly sliced green onion and by the way if you want to add shrimp to this or chicken you can totally do that and it would be absolutely delicious but we have to keep this similar to make this a proper competition and that right there is a proper chow mein i mean and just looking at it side by side i think we've won but uh who knows maybe it tastes the same so there's nothing left to do other than taste test and find out chow mein let's go speaker pointed this out earlier but this is like the desaturated version this is the raw photo file and then this is post-production okay let's do a smell test first soy rich garlic smell the cabbage the seared cabbage caramelized wet sock really wet sock i already know what this tastes like so we're gonna give this a taste here we go aren't oxygen oh yeah oh it's a good i don't know what the i don't know this is perfect exactly what you want to taste when you think of chow mein you think chewy nice fragrant noodles you got the kick from spicy garlic but you also have that toasted garlic the green onion the umami the white pepper kind of comes in just a little underhanded a little bit of a spice you could add chili so this would be even better look you already know that i'm going to say this as a winner it's the easy one can't say that because people will be like oh my god for that i say we're bringing in a taste tester oh is it going to be the bowl is it going to be the cardboard box that was number one now number two choo choo oh god why do you have to stick your tongue out which one well number two like i've said several times on this channel now number two tasted like number two that was clearly number one you still taste a little bit of oil but like you taste the sesame oil you taste the flavors this just tastes like fry oil and nothing else there's the textures i don't mind like the noodles have a good texture they were very similar in texture yeah almost identical so if you want a bowl of texture and no flavor like eating a cloud go this way but a depressing cloud by the way this is a rain cloud this is like a rain cloud you had a terrible day and it's raining on you and you're sad you just want to go home but your house flooded go for this one you want to be happy for the rest of your life i just spit everywhere if you want to be happy for the rest of your life you're going to want the butt better version you want to know what else is full of glazed hot noodles and lots of slurping b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our panda express chow mein butt better and what did i say we blew it out of the water brother all right we got done didn't they she is the beautiful thing about this dish is it's so fast to put together if you have a proper wok you can make a beautiful charmaine and it is so so so good just on its own you could add some grilled chicken you could add some grilled shrimp or if you're a vegetarian i don't even think this dish is vegetarian is it i never really know whatever you can add grilled tofu or even fried tofu that possibilities are endless this is a perfect base for flavor flavor thank you kate we've said everything we need to say now with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] you

four million i cannot express to you how much it means to me the team everyone involved so with all that said let's make this darn recipe okay so today we are making breakfast two different ways we've got the full english alexa i'm not talking to you shut up i'm not even being it's a robot just right off the bat i have a feeling i may lean more towards the full english only because there's more options but i'm not sure yet i have to make it i have to put it together and do all the right things bring them together two plates one gentleman and one mouth so with all that said let's make this shall we all right folks this is a true showdown an all-american breakfast versus a full english breakfast minus the black pudding though because not everyone loves it feel free to add if you wish now let's begin with the all-american of course we have to talk about bacon very simple get the thickest sliced bacon you can find and for about two to four people you can place four to eight slices on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil pop that into a cold oven then set it to 450 degrees fahrenheit and set a timer for 20 to 25 minutes now once your timer has gone off your bacon should be a beautiful golden brown and cooked perfectly if it's not crispy or dark enough then just leave it in there and tell well it is up to 10 more minutes then pull that out let it drain on a paper towel and that's your bacon next up is our hash browns snag three chunky rusted potatoes wash and peel them beautifully then using a box grater grate all of your potatoes then place them into a large bowl season them with salt very generously toss together and you're gonna want to squeeze them pretty aggressively to coax some of that wawa out then give this a nice rinse under water drain them and place in a dish towel wrap that up and wring out as much water as you can from there just heat up a medium non-stick pan over medium heat add in just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom of the pan around two and a half tablespoons once the pan is hot hot whoa press in some of your potato mixture enough to fit that pan edge to edge then let that cook for three to four minutes or until you get a nice crust and the potatoes are half cooked through give it a nice flip or well as best you can then repeat on the other side once it's a beautiful brown on both sides and the inside is cooked through it's done season its taste with salt if needed then repeat with the rest of your potatoes next up is our pancakes i find it so annoying that people go to buy box mix when in reality it takes literally three to five minutes just to make your own mix sorry to admit it but you're saving yourself little to no time by doing that just a note from papa this recipe is from my ultimate pancake guide the link for that is in the description you make the batter optionally let it rest then heat up a large non-stick pan over medium heat lightly grease it with cooking spray or vegetable oil then cook three to four quarter cup mounds of batter at a time for about three minutes per side or until you flip and get a gorgeous dark golden brown on both sides and the inside is fluffy and cooked through stack and place those to the side on a plate to keep warm as you finish the rest for the eggs you can cook them however you want but typically i see them scrambled so we're going to do that i call this a medium scramble not rubbery but also not super loose and rich like a soft scramble in a medium non-stick pan heat up two tablespoons of unsalted butter until it's melted and bubbling crack four to six eggs into a medium-sized bowl and give those a nice whisk until they're homogeneous then pour those into your pan then while constantly stirring with a spatula and shaking the pan cook these bad boys for about two to three minutes and look when i say constantly i mean constantly don't stop the movement you'll notice that they go from creamy then they'll thicken then they'll form curds and as soon as it's formed curds and there's just a little bit of liquid left and they aren't total rubber remove them from the heat season it tastes with salt and optionally a little bit of black pepper and those are your eggs listen if your eggs do happen to go rubbery well then papa no hug now to plate this up well you're gonna need a plate then place down your fat stack followed by a pad of butter some of your eggs a touch of fresh cracked black pepper on those and some thinly sliced chives add on your beautiful hash browns and last but not least your bacon as crunchy or floppy as you like it look enjoy your bacon however you need don't let anyone tell you how to live your life alright so we've got our american style breakfast contender i think it's time to go english we first must have our bean discussion because it's well very important to this dish get a medium sauce pot and add one and a half cups or 350 milliliters of chicken stock three quarters of a cup or 180 milliliters of water three and a half tablespoons or 53 grams of dark brown sugar two and a half tablespoons or 35 grams of tomato paste a third cup or 80 grams of ketchup three large cloves of garlic lightly crushed by hand give them a little bow and finally add two sprigs of fresh sage this was a large sprig so i did just one set the heat to medium high and bring that to a boil then immediately reduce the temperature to low and simmer for 12 to 15 minutes or until slightly reduced then add three cans of drained navy beans and simmer for another five minutes then separately combine one tablespoon or 14 grams of cornstarch and one and a half tablespoons or 21 grams of water whisk together to create a slurry then stream and whisk in about half of that into your beans let that continue to heat for a few minutes and if that's sticky wicky to your liking then stop there if not then add the rest of your cornstarch slurry then just season that to taste with salt and pepper if needed and place it to the side to keep warm okay so the mushrooms and tomatoes can be cooked in the same pan so get a large skillet add two tablespoons of unsalted butter and a generous glug of extra virgin olive oil set that over medium-high heat just until the butter is fully melted in cut the stems off all your mushrooms if you wish then add them to your pan stem side up yes the whole darn thing brother be sure to leave enough room on the other half of the pan to then add two to three clusters of cherry or grape tomatoes season the taste with salt optionally toss in a couple sprigs of fresh thyme doesn't that just look beautiful already it's about to have me boissen now just let this cook without moving them around too much for three minutes or until the mushrooms get a nice color carefully flip all your mushrooms and cook for another three minutes until the mushrooms get a nice color and the tomatoes are softened lovely and caramelized and keep those warm on the side now for your meat we're not using regular old belly bacon you specifically need english back bacon it looks like this it's essentially the loin from well the back of our three little pigs now heat up a medium sized pan over medium high coat the bottom with a little bit of oil then once that's ripping hot sear off your back bacon for one to two minutes or until you get some color then flip and repeat on the other side you gotta sear this quick otherwise it'll go dry if done right you may consider it over belly bacon or well maybe not it's up to you once you've stirred off your desired amount of back bacon in that same pan add in some already cooked sausages of choice or you can boil your own from raw that's up to you these are miniature smoked sausages then just simply sear those guys on all sides for about one minute or take in a nice coating of deep brown with a touch of char here and there about five minutes total place those to the side to keep warm as well think warm like a hug from last but not least is our eggs i chose to go sunny side up here and of course i have a special technique for that heat up a non-stick skillet over medium high toss in about two tablespoons of butter let it melt completely and begin to label crack in two to three eggs and let those cook just until the whites are set then base the top of your eggs with the butter to both cook and flavor the tops then once the whites are fully set and the yolk is still remove your eggies snag yourself a plate and begin to assemble start off with your hot egg men hit them with some fresh cracked black pepper peppa's favorite flaky salt followed by a generous helping of your english baked beans your glistening sausages seared back bacon caramelized tomatoes and roasty mushrooms oh and of course toast too although i couldn't fit it on the plate so maybe just serve that on the side also more specifically toast goes with both of these plates i highly recommend any bread you damn well choose a nice brioche is a classy choice but there's nothing wrong with a plain white bread or heck you could even go whole wheat if you desire don't ask me how to toast the bread i hope you know in the toaster please okay so we have our two beautiful breakfast gentlemen now it's time for them to both duke it out in the octagon of flavor okay so we have our all-american breakfaster well not all american it's just an american style breakfast eggs bacon hash browns pancakes of course the american one is half carbohydrates and half fat but we're going to eat this all as one unit so get a little bit of bacon a little bit of hash one some egg there's nostalgic childlike flavor wait hang on that's not what i meant to say this brings me back to my childhood that's what i'm trying to say stop making it weird and maple syrup also why do they always put the pancakes on this plate because guess what watch what's gonna happen when i do this oh low there's nothing better than just adding like tree sap on my scrambled eggs they're fluffy they're sweet i love pancakes i'm a big fan of pancakes we know what this tastes like okay if you're american you know exactly what this tastes like this versus the english breakfast will nostalgia win will it no you can't have this without toast just saying the beans right off the bat i'm stoked about these okay i love the beans they come with english breakfast i love them this is something you just kind of eat all together you know you get a little bit egg get that yolk running get a piece of sausage some beans i mean this this is like a perfect meal this is my kind of an experience look how many ways you can eat this unlimited adventure so being born and raised in america i feel a little wrong saying this personally me the eating experience of an english breakfast is superior all the different flavors all the different textures you can eat multiple things some with toast some without toast a little bit of this a little bit of that that's how i like to eat but the american style breakfast you can't forget about the beauty of a pancake the beauty of a hash brown right i'm not saying this is better than that but collectively as an experience i enjoy this one more you want to know what else is full of papa's glistening sausage b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our english breakfast versus american style breakfast who is the winner at the end of the day it's a subjective choice really they're both delicious they're both absolutely fantastic i'm not from england but i'm still choosing the full english because i just like to taste multiple things yes the american style breakfast offers that but there's not as many layers of flavor as i would want there to be regardless of what i say the choice is yours you pick it here's the ingredients here's the recipe so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you [Music] you
176,176,Making S'mores Completely From Scratch At Home | But Better,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y8pV2rGsnsc/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBLaaX_uZDU5YCl1vF4S4nKsoB3Nw,y8pV2rGsnsc,"9 minutes, 48 seconds",Not only did we make our own marshmallows and graham crackers... but we had to step it up even higher with completely homemade chocolate. Meaning we literally ground our own chocolate. Now...,2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, you know we've always gone over the fast food cultish sort of foods but what about childhood nostalgia you think that's safe no it's not [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today we are making s'mores but not just any s'more s'mores have to be the most basic laziest dessert you can think of all right lazy maybe a little derogatory what i'm trying to say is it's ridiculously simple you toast the marshmallows you put them in between graham crackers and chocolate that's it i kind of don't want to do this because i'm going all the way we're making everything not just the marshmallows and graham crackers we've done that before on this channel it's not that hard but we're gonna be making our own chocolate too all right i'm taking this very seriously because we are winning one way or another i have nothing else to say other than let's make this shall we we've got the box honey made with real honey uh right and oh no uh the worst chocolate on the planet physically possible since this video is going to be going up on mother's day who better than to make the ultimate s'more did my mommy papa's mama what uh you know how to assemble a small i don't have to tell you how to do this oh sorry no they're broken see this is why you never buy honey made that's why you don't throw it on the floor i'll stand back here ah oh my that works good you ready yep oh wow that actually looks really good can i taste it first i want to taste it first ah taste test number one what do you think nostalgia no close your ears this actually isn't that good maybe it's because i already ate all i know there's not that much flavor involved all i taste is like sugar sugar and sugar for some reason i remember more flavor in this when i was a kid but maybe that's because i was a dumb kid point is i do think that we can make this better simply by adding flavor is there anything inherently wrong with this no i get it this is how it's supposed to be but we can make it way better don't you think i should hope so i'm taking the homemade aspect of this to the extreme we aren't just making our own marshmallows and graham crackers today i am literally going to grind and make my own chocolate entirely from scratch has papa gone off the deep end now let's start with the chocolate because that will easily take the longest in order to do this you're going gonna need well a chocolate grinder the link for mine will be below now if you want to be a reasonable person you could just buy your own chocolate but we played the unreasonable game in the game of flavor first heat up the base of your grinder in the grinder bowl in an oven set to its lowest temp for about five to ten minutes or until just warm reassemble the machine and turn on the grinder from there you're gonna add 900 grams of cocoa bean nibs only a quarter cup at a time allowing the nibs to grind up for a few seconds before adding more continue that until you've added all of your nibs now let that grind for one hour then add 295 grams of fine granulated sugar again in batches in a steady stream until you've added all of your sugar then all you've got to do is set that brother up to grind for 24 hours yup you might want to start this at a time that you uh want to be making the bars the next day after 24 hours you'll be met with a beautifully fragrant and smooth melted chocolate awaiting you to temper the chocolate pull out your marble slab because we all have one right anyway to temper simply pour all of your chocolate into a cork container then pour two thirds of that container onto your marble slab spread it with a scraper or offset spatula scooping it up over itself and spreading it over and over until it starts to cool and lightly thicken do not let it solidify scrape all that back into your container stir it together and it should be around 84 degrees fahrenheit i just want to note that when we made this on camera i actually cooled it to 91 fahrenheit which was a terrible idea and caused the chocolate to bloom keep it to 84 and it'll get a nicer finish with a stronger snap now from there pour your tempered chocolate into a and spread it to fill the mold fully then simply let that cool to room temp till hard okay now that that's finally over let's talk marshmallows shockingly easy i'd recommend starting these the same day you start your chocolate if you choose that route snag a 9x9 baking pan spray it with cooking spray then line it with enough parchment so it has overhang on both sides next in the bowl of a stand mixer add in half a cup of water and sprinkle in three packets or 24 grams of gelatin and let that sit in high drink next grab a medium saucepan and add a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of water three quarters of a cup or 255 grams of light corn syrup and finally two cups or 400 grams of granulated sugar give it a light stir to hydrate the sugar place it on the stove set over medium high and bring that to a boil once it starts boiling let that go for about one minute no stirring allowed if you stir papa big sad and once the mixture reaches 240 degrees fahrenheit remove it from the heat and place it to the side now in the stand mixer fitted with the whiskey business attachment begin mixing on medium-low until the gelatin mixture is beaten up then slowly and steadily add your sugar syrup by pouring it down the side of the bowl while it's continuously mixing increasing its mixing speed gradually as you add your hot syrup anyway once all your syrup is added and you're beating on high speed let it continue to be until the mixture is white voluminous and leaves a very thick ribbon when pulled from the bowl then immediately pour into your prepared baking pan spread out your mallow man until it's evenly distributed in the pan then simply let that sit at room temp uncovered for at least four hours but ideally overnight then once your marshmallow is set dust the top with powdered sugar invert it onto a work surface peel your parchment off dust again with powdered sugar then spray a knife with cooking oil dust that with powdered sugar and cut your marshmallows into nice even cubes you can make them as big or as small as you like but i like them thick in once cut dust your marshmallows again shake off the excess and that's it oh and yes before you ask they toast in the most beautiful way i've ever seen okay so for the graham crackers we're gonna use the exact same dough from my key lime pie recipe only this time once the little dough man is done oh so cute let's kiss him and then dust him with flour and roll him out until a quarter inch thick then simply cut that into evenly sized rectangles that are about three inches long and one and a half inches wide try to keep those edges neat since we're assembling s'mores here then place those on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper poke all your fillers with a fork and bake at 350 fahrenheit for 15 to 20 minutes or until dry and crisp all right folks we have our graham crackers we got the choco latte and of course our geometric marshmallows you should know how to assemble this get two of your graham crackers place on a few squares of chocolate ideally the same shape as the cracker toast your marshmallows on all of its faces in this case until a beautiful caramelized brown i ended up doing three mallows per small place those atop your choco then simply crown your king and sure it was a lot of work but the results speak for themselves so now we have a true battle we face against the grocery store version who will win probably me let's find out okay we have our second one here and i'm gonna cut it in half all right this is a mess first off flavor immediately there's actually flavor here there's not just sugar you've got the offset balance of the bittersweet chocolate plus these homemade marshmallows that really takes it away from me mine caramelized i think it has something to do with the powdered sugar it creates almost a creme brulee exterior it's got some crunch on the outside it's melty it's got some viscosity to it too it's not just pure liquid like sugar pee in your mouth i don't know why i'm comparing this to pete but the point is this is edible i want this over and over this i i'm done after the first bite but we cannot do this without a proper taste test so mama come on in it's the time to make another taste she's got the butt better blindfold on it okay so number one we go right into it number there we go number two so that was number two you had number one i gotta have any flashbacks from the peanut butter honey peanut butter and jelly number one or number two number two all right that's back we made it back from the peanut butter and jelly i need a trophy let's talk about how i won for a second okay okay so after the peanut butter and jelly we lost that one you know we had to go back it's okay it's not your fault it's my fault it's my fault it's my fault so the takeaway is obviously making your own chocolate maybe not realistic it's expensive i get it okay but the marshmallows and arguably even the graham crackers those are the game changers you can always go buy fancy chocolate at the store that's easy the marshmallows are immeasurably better than any store-bought marshmallow you'll ever get the crunch the flavor the caramelization it's like a little pocket of creme brulee in between two layers of chocolate you know what i'm saying so if you're gonna do anything out of this video you should make the marshmallows you should make the graham crackers that's all i gotta say end of story we won but better episode i don't know you want to know what else is full of plump pillows and melty warm sweetness this sounds uh raunchier than i wanted it to be [Music] roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our s'mores and we won of course if we didn't win this would have really been a pain for me you know it would have given me flashbacks to a peanut butter jelly episode mom i love you okay it's okay it only hurts a lot every day the point that i want to make is simply one thing if you make things from scratch and you know what you're doing and you take the time to manage the flavors in the way that you want them then you're gonna end up with a perfect product or what would be a perfect product to you as an individual eating is an individualized experience who's calling me right now hello hey sir from comcast again i'm right here by your garage you got shut oh okay i'll come get you anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you

to me it's like i'll stick to cooking nope you're dancing this video's not coming out unless you dance the challenge is if everybody recreates the dish within a certain marker and it is good i will dance all right we're at our workstation so first things first go to your prep areas you've got a bowl grab your snap peas place those little men into a bowl all right you've got your olive oil you'll have to open that up and then go ahead and drizzle your snap peas with olive oil a little bit of salt your pepper so i'm doing my pepper okay peppers ah so i'm going to take this to my grill into your grill pan and onto the grill on the hot side or not hot side cool so those are grilling get your radish then you're just gonna slice that as thinly as you can i would just say slice the whole thing we'll probably use like three or four of these guys so many how often do you cook three times a day okay okay that's more than actually that's a lot especially these days right see that's what i like to hear this is the time this is the time to be alive to really experience a nice meal with the fam toss your snap peas around how charred do we want our snap peas over here a good amount of char is nice nothing wrong with that i don't want them like completely black but little little charred spots are nice mine are not too charred at all mine look amazing those are charring cooking whatever they're doing gonna get our steak prepped out so go ahead and open up your lid stick out of there i'm open should i have paper towels you got paper towels uh i have no paper towel you set me up for disaster again i'm so sorry okay i'm just gonna use the one on the ground that's why yeah mine's gonna taste great so pull the meat out you get one good slap flat side of your knife there you go do you like that make sure the steak is nice and dry i don't want any wet spots at all season that guy with salt and pepper generously all sides go generous don't uh don't be shy get yourself a paper towel or you can spray your grill grates or spray your griddle yeah get a little spray you got spray okay we want charred not too sharp go into the i'm gonna i'm gonna put them to the medium side of the grill now yeah that's good i like that that's that's a smart idea i got mine on the media miner cook cool drop your meat on hot side hot side sear your meat press it into those grates get some nice color it's going to take a little bit so it's a fatty like mine medium rare so i'm cooking this medium rare take a little time how's your snap peas feel we want them snappy but not mushy a little bit of give i think mine are pretty done i'm pulling mine off i'm looking at him i'm not gonna lie don't cheat i'm just looking i'm smelling when do you want us to flip not yet probably like two minutes something like that on her side i'm waiting for you this is all about patience whoa whoa no cheating what you think i'm cheating off cam wow he threw you under the bus all right i'm flipping to one of the sides okay like 90 degrees or 180. flip mine over to one of the smaller sides so 90. should have a nice crust oh cam's gonna have such a good crust mine's perfect i might rip mine off and finish it off over there see once again you sabotage me by telling me a hotter point was on the other side you know sometimes grill points they move around okay okay well that's grilling go back to your station grab your knife you should see some chives oh yeah yeah you like that so just grab about half of those put them out on your board and then you're just going to slice those nice and thin wow you are way faster than me it's kind of disgusting you don't want them to uh mismatch you know you can put them in a bowl you can put them back in another container but we want them set to the side to finish with garnish how's your steak feeling i haven't done a touch test but touch testing i think i'm better out i'm still rare good make sure everything's nice and tidy my workstation's clean i'm a good boy now what do we do now we're just waiting we're waiting for this thing to vibe out what was this big garlic for garlic i have a huge thing of garlic shouldn't have garlic oh is that just diverse that was a diversion so we're just we're just grilling it we're bringing it to medium rare i'm not gonna lie i think i'm at medium rare all right you're at medium rare i'm following your lead i will get your me's ready for when we put together the snap piece just so we're ready get your lemon out okay i would get just one cheek off of it you're gonna you're gonna take your lemon and just cut a side of it off not in half you should have a little bit of lemon left because we're gonna zest the rest of it so with our steaky all right you should be nice nice and springy colored oh yeah mine's almost there turn him over so one of his bigger sort of more longer flat sides is up take about a tablespoon of your butter place that on top of the steak all right just let that melt on top while it's grilling try not to let it fall off we're gonna let it sort of baste itself oh my god this is crazy we're basting okay so we're getting plates what are you doing don't look at me look away okay all right every time somebody looks at me i'm playing the siren oh yeah you look great you look so good nobody's as beautiful as you you're the most beautiful woman i've ever seen all right uh turn the camera off cameron how are you doing over there bud looks like your aim is just about as good as your steak over there i'm worried about his snake over there i'm pulling my steak yeah this thing's gotta be fun oh hell yeah benny pull your steak snake is off you got your snappy peas are those that are still warm mine are warm no butter right put a little butter on your steak if you want a little a little extra oh she's resting why not okay so the steak is down we're gonna rest this for five minutes benny uh what's your favorite color i i'd say purple is that was that a real question that's a real real question why is purple your favorite color maybe because of prince the artist that's a beautiful sorry camera look away cameron keeps looking at me next time karen looks at me go go tickle them okay so you got your bowl i got my bowl cool are your snap keys warm yes okay snap these are very warm snap peas are very warm that's what we want we want them hot you're gonna zest that part of your lemon into your snap peas so zest is on then gonna hit it with some salt which sauce your kosher salt then a cheek of lemon juice generous drizzle of olive oil stir all that together you're now dressing snap peas taste them you might need a little more salt of course it does and a little bit more lemon juice first or stir mine needs the same thing take four of your plumpest snap peas and you're going to cut them in half but you're going to cut them in half at a diagonal lengthwise remember at a diagonal lengthwise with each of them not sure that's what he meant by that but if your steak is properly rested you're then going to cut that steak into nice quarter inch slices lengthwise with what long length long length so you want us to cut it as if the long length is the long slice squares not rectangles okay okay now then place those slices on a paper towel to drain a little bit so they don't drain on the on the plate i think my grill was a little too hot i need a paper towel to do fabrication somebody get this made of paper towel i got this i don't i need i do need a paper towel this is too small of a pig more paper towels i flayed out a little bit on the uh on the plate just to touch you're then going to alternate your snap peas laying them on top of each other sort of letting them naturally fall down give it a little bit of height you know don't be don't be don't be shy i'm doing as you see take your sliced radishes and then lay those sort of like staining them up on the right or left side i guess it doesn't matter and sort of in a diagonal let them lay naturally on the peas yep next to the steak all right little bit of chives across the veg not the steak hit the veg just a touch of olive oil take the pea puree we're going to make little dots on the steak across the whole steak in just a single dot oh my god that is full oh my god it just shoots out yeah that's not supposed to happen is your is yours messing up yeah it's not supposed to what did you do to the pea puree so you're gonna get you're gonna do your best to get dots at this point it's every man to himself now hit that with a little bit of flaky salt on top of the steak this is so bad garnish your steak with micro cilantro and flowers get creative garnish your steak nicely making a flower out of flowers and radishes look at that now last thing we're going to do get your olive oil and just do a nice little ring around your whole plate up do what you got that just ruined my entire thing that just ruined it oh sh you saw the before right but i'm taking the ring out let me know when you're ready to show i'm ready i'm ready hold on i'm taking my ring out that you  up i'm not even over there oh you're doing it all what it's supposed to look like that look at this look at these gentlemen all coming together this looks gorgeous all right we got three different plates here that's a medium rare we all look great i mean these all look really good to me yeah i think we did great i think this is actually i'm actually really see look that's what happened with the olive oil you see that i like it oh you liked it like that i cleaned mine off okay we'll go here first tastes terrible awful yours terrible ham on yours i'm just gonna eat the flour let's taste mine oh my god clear water honestly they all taste identical by the way guys they're all terrible okay so i'm gonna try mine first everything in one bite and just roll it up off the top it tastes exactly like kind of what i expected it jacob sees it nicely a little over it's a little closer to medium that's mine by the way the pea puree perfect benny killed it everything seasoned really nicely i'm happy with it i mean i know i know what mine's gonna taste like okay i'm gonna go for yours next then cam nappies look perfect that's pretty fire it looks like it might be overdone but i think it's a combination of the cut because it's so marbled perfectly edible that roasty anxious flavor that's very present in this steak penny looking good all these look beautiful by the way i'm actually kind of upset how well they turned out i was kind of hoping that they were going to look bad but they look actually really good it's really good but it doesn't have the the flavor profile are you coaching me through my judging process now he's coaching me through this i'm just you can all three of these are actually really close to where i wanted them to be they're all in the same sort of vicinity i've noticed that both of you guys had your own way of doing it and i wouldn't say that one is necessary better than the other and that's not a pc answer each of these i think just have your own influence on them you executed it beautifully i have nothing wrong with either of these we have two culinary killers here you know what i think my verdict is everybody today everybody is a winner of course and when you turn off the camera you'll tell us we all know that this was a this was a setup from day one you completely sabotaged me on the meat you did it on purpose because you knew i was so superior than you as a chef it's not even my side hustle it's my hobby that i love to do and you were so threatened by it that you made my meat medium i don't i need you you beat my meat okay so it's a done deal benny did a beautiful job cameron did a beautiful job unfortunately that means that i have to commit to the dance the dance that benny said that if they win which i don't know that it's a win per se i think we all win but if they got close enough to winning then i would have to dance so

if you're interested in getting this award-winning security system visit the link in the description simply safe.com backslash joshua weissman now let's talk about the barbacoa so today we're making beef barbacoa we're making the taco form and we're making the meat and we're gonna have a special mystery guest at the end it's kind of a sandwich it's not really a guest it's more of like a physical thing that you eat but you get the point the meat itself is the most important component oftentimes people have trouble making it because it requires putting an animal under the ground wrapped in agave leaves and then a fire and then there's warmth not everybody's gonna do that in their backyard so we're gonna try and mimic that the best way we can to create the meatiest juiciest we can plumpness so with all that said let's make this shall we right oh so we got a three piece here for you today we're making the beautifully fatty barbacoa meat of course a classy taco but because i'd like to get a little naughty a torta version as well now let us begin with our meat traditionally this would be a whole animal wrapped in agave leaves and then roasted underground but i figured that i'll make this easy on you and we'll find another way to mimic that first thing you'll need is two pounds of beef brisket i really recommend some form of wagyu brisket if you can shell the extra cash for that intramuscular fat but of course regular brisket is fine and two pounds of beef cheeks more specifically cheeks that are highly cut those into three inch chunks and do your best to keep them evenly sized now begin heating a heavy bottom pot over medium high add just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom season all your meaty gentlemen generously with salt to taste then add your beef in batches to avoid overcrowding and let those sear for two to three minutes per side so you get some nice beautifully deep brown beefy boys now look for the record this will get browned as it cooks in its own fat so it's okay to go light on the color as well now place those to the side as you finish and repeat with the rest of your buff now once you're done turn off the heat add all of your beef back to the pot and it's okay to kind of smush your meat all in there sometimes you get to smush your meat it's fine once it's fit in there nice and snug add two cups or 475 milliliters of beef stock five to eight cloves of garlic that have been peeled and smashed four guajillo chilies two teaspoons or five grams of ground cumin three bay leaves and one cinnamon stick finally add a quarter cup more of water just to moisten everything a touch more than bring that up to a boil over medium-high immediately reduce the heat to low and bring to a simmer then add a parchment cartouche inside the pot or you know you could also just add a layer of parchment in between the lid and the pot if you don't want to be super fancy this sort of seals the pot in a similar way that the agave leaves might then place your pot in an oven set to 300 fahrenheit for four to six hours yes patience is key with a good barbacoa now that gives us plenty of time to kick back crack open a cold one and prep our other components to make your salsa verde in a medium sized pot add one sweet onion rough chopped four jalapenos rough chopped five cloves of garlic thinly sliced and one and a half pounds or 680 grams of tomatillos that have had their papery skins removed been rinsed you know like a nice little bath and quartered now add just enough water to cover season that lightly with salt and place in the stove set to medium high and boil for five to eight minutes or till soft then simply fish out your veg place it in a blender begin blending on medium speed adding cooking water if needed once that's smooth add half a bunch of fresh cilantro blend again on high until completely smooth pour that into a bowl and cool over an ice bath at this point you can season it to taste with salt and lime juice then just continuously stir until cold and delicious now obviously you can roast all your vegetables instead of boiling them but i think this creates a more mellow version it really allows you to taste the unadulterated flavor of the tomatillo and jalapeno but wait oh no papa what else can i do while i'm waiting well i'm glad you asked you could also prep your onions and cilantro for the tacos now look a lot of places will rough chop their onions but instead i like to make a nice even brunoise which is essentially a fine dice now all you gotta do is take a sweet onion cut the top and the bottom off slice it in half peel it then remove the onion layers like this cut those layers in half width-wise and then cut them into little evenly sized batons once you have your batons cut across those to get a nice beautiful even square fine dice papa trix for the day and obviously for your cilantro just literally rough chop it okay back to my meat i mean your meat i mean like the meat we were cooking once your meat is done remove it from the oven should be nice and browned and unbelievably tender place it in a roasting pan to gaze upon its jiggly juicy goodness and shred it as finely as you can using two forks now listen carefully i need you to not be scared of the fat shred that bad boy in it's gonna get you that traditional texture and insanely delicious barbacoa flavor now once your meaty meat is shredded taste it and adjust salt levels if needed and i mean it come on dude look at this dude if you think this ain't poison you need to check yourself before papa leave the room now to assemble your tacos get an ice corn or flour tortilla heat that bad boy up and be sure to get a touch of char on it place the tortilla down add on a generous portion of your meaty good good add as much or as little salsa verde as your heart desires hit that with your finely diced sweet oil and finally your very finely chopped fresh cilantro oh and of course a lime wedge don't you just want to cry looking at this cry just for a little bit then eat it so fast it's borderline disgusting to watch but you don't care because you're happy now let's see how happy it can really make us ah eight hours later and it is gonna be worth it you get your taco alright there's a way to eat this we've already put the salsa we've already put the onions the cilantro it's looking gorgeous but a little bit of lime juice let the entrance begin this is the juiciness the fattiness is salty it's rich and it's melting falling apart your mouth this is exactly what you want on a barbacoa is it ultra traditional no we did not dig a hole in my backyard and then throw a whole cow in there and wrap it in agave leaves i would love to have done that i just don't think that the hoa would have approved here but what we did do we put it in a dutch oven to braise but we covered it with a cartouche to create that sort of steaming effect so it's lightly braising it's making all these flavors and falling apart and now you come to something that is nearly identical to a proper arbor code the takeaway is if you've had proper barbacoa this is your chance to make it and make it as best as you probably ever will without drilling a hole in your ground and if you've never had it before what are you doing get your get to the store okay it is for the most part we all have our ingredients that we need you just need some bread for tortoises which can either be some bolio rolls or telara bread now all we gotta make is our torta sauce in a medium sized bowl add one cup of mayonnaise optionally a quarter cup of your salsa verde two cloves of grated garlic one tablespoon of chipotle powder three tablespoons of finely chopped cilantro and two teaspoons of finely chopped fresh oregano give that a mix season the taste with salt and the juice of one to two limes stir again and that's your torta sauce right so assembly is real easy slice your torta bread in half toast it in a pan with butter till it's beautifully golden on both the cut side and the top and bottom place that brother on a work surface and sauce both cut sides generously with torta sauce stack on your meat some of your salsa verde as much or as little pickled red onions as you like actually like quite a bit on the sandwich yummy hit that with some crumbled cotija cheese and lastly a generous little garden of fresh cilantro leaves then grab your other half and carefully crown your king split it in half and let the angels sing then all you gotta do is take a nice trip to i'm going to put this in my mouth town we had to do an extra special one for the people so torta you know it's a nice little sandal we got some pickled onions oh need salsa this is the sandwich that you yearn for with the essence the meaning the salt of a taco we know what the barbacoa tastes like but you've got that acidic nice mayo the crunchy acidic bite from the onion it all helps cut through that fatty richness and of course this delicious mildly spicy salsa verde i would give it a mild but i know some people are gonna eat this and be like oh that's so spicy the point is if i ever wanted a barbacoa torta it's this one right here if you already have barbacoa on hand you might as well go to a local mexican bakery before you make it because you're going to have leftovers and you're going to want to put it in this you want to know what else is full of dripping moist meat b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so before we even say anything thank you again to simply say for sponsoring this video again if you want

We all know it. We all love it. However, going out with friends and family trying to enjoy a steamy plate of meat, beans, vegetables, and warm tortillas...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, so if you've ever gone out with your friends or family and you go get fajitas and then you look at the menu you're like when you see that price why deal with that when you can have them for this price right here that is much [Music] cheaper [Music] so okay so today we're making fajitas this is commonly served at tex-mex restaurants i live in texas i eat it all the time big fan of it but it is insanely expensive for what you actually get it's meat vegetables some tortillas but at the end of the day if you make it from home and you're conscientious of the ingredients that you use you could have something arguably significantly better for a significantly lower price we're doing the meat with all the accoutrements that means vegetables beans rice tortillas everything and that's all for this price per person so with all that said let's make this shall we wait a minute papa what are the components that even make up a fajita meal well my child of course you have the meats the classic fajita vegetables then some dope beans mexican style rice and i guess you know avocado work wok is optional oh and cheese oh and also tortillas always tortillas now let's begin with the mexican rice first wash off your rice we're using two cups of basmati rice submerge it in water drain then submersion in water again and drain again this is a standard rule for any kind of steam rice and hopefully you know this by now and once that's done get a small saucepan and stay calm we're not cooking the rice in here okay to that you're gonna add three tablespoons of vegetable oil heat that over medium heat once that's hot add in four cloves of minced garlic let that cook swirling occasionally until you get a light golden color then add one teaspoon of chipotle powder one teaspoon of ground cumin give that a swirl and let that cook until the spices get a little toasty about 20 seconds now add your two cups of rinsed basmati rice give that a stir and let that lightly toast in the pan for about one minute stirring often then pour all of your rice into a rice cooker base along with eight ounces of crushed tomatoes one and a quarter cup of chicken stock give it a light stir and pop it into your rice cooker press the on button and let it work its see it's sort of a similar process to the chicken rice okay so while that's cooking we gotta get the beans on start with three plump roma tomatoes and either under your broiler or with a kitchen torch char those bad boys all over i mean really blast these brothers once you've blackened just the skins let those sit for five minutes then peel all their skins off cut them in half squeeze their seeds out and give those beauties a nice dice for a good old-fashioned geese from papa now get a medium sauce pot and begin heating it over medium high get six ounces of chorizo oh real nice josh oh wow okay oh wow dang he really doing that squeeze it out of the casing that looks nasty let that cook and sear stirring occasionally until fully cooked and starting to get some nice browning next up you're gonna add one finely diced yellow onion two medium jalapenos sliced and if you're a little baby and you don't want it spicy then first say i'm a little baby and add one green bell pepper instead little stinky baby poopy bit give that a stir season the taste with salt and let that continue to cook and sweat for two to three minutes stirring occasionally until the vegetables begin to soften then add your fire roasted diced tomato from earlier one and a quarter cup of chicken stock increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil then immediately reduce to low and simmer for about five to eight minutes or until reduced by a quarter add two cans of drained pinto beans and let that continue to simmer until everything is hot and those are papa's beans let's talk about grilling meats grilling meat meat grilled papa's fat meat right to keep the cost low we're going to use two pounds of boneless skinless chicken thighs in a small bowl combine one tablespoon of chipotle powder one tablespoon of ground cumin one teaspoon of ground cinnamon and one tablespoon of kosher salt give that some whiskey business and season all your chicky thighs on both sides generously with your seasoning give your thighs a light pounding just until they're flattened so they're even in thickness all the way through we don't need to be paper thin all right relax with the pounding now ideally you would place these in a container or a bag to cure in their seasoning over night obviously in the refrigerator or you can use them right away but you know which one do you think i want you to do of course overnight maximum flavor now fire up a grill of some sort and because this is a butt cheaper you can also just use what you got worst case scenario you can see these in a cast iron pan or grill pan here i'm using a japanese conroe grill which is traditionally used for yakitori always flexing now you're gonna want a hot side and a cool side of the grill lightly spray your grates or even the chicken with cooking spray place your thighs onto the hot side of the grill and let those bad boys get some nice grill marks in half turn if desired see the beauty of these conroe girls is you actually get grill action all over the chicken now once you have some good color and a touch of char about three to four minutes flip the chicken and repeat on the other side by the time both sides are nicely colored they should be fully cooked to an internal temperature of 165 fahrenheit but if not you can just toss those on the cooler side of your grill to finish cooking from the residual heat while you grill the rest of your chicken homies now as they finish place them on a tray covering with foil to keep your juicy moist thighs nice and hot for papa and optionally you can also add a nice squeeze of lime juice on top of your thighs for a very beautiful time okay we have all of our good good except our most important fajita peppers and onions guys why am i not seeing you make this more often it's too easy to continue saying no for any longer you're gonna need one large sweet onion julienned which is just cutting the top and the bottom off slicing it in half and then slicing it thinly across the grain like so to get lovely little half moons one large red bell pepper sliced into batons and one large green bell pepper also sliced into batons then just heat a large skillet over medium high and add 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil once that oil is hot hot oh my god add in your veg and let that sear to get some color about one to two minutes season it with kosher salt give it a good toss and continue to cook over medium high tossing often until you get some nice caramelization and charring on the vegetables and listen carefully texturally they should be soft but still have a little bit of bite to them then turn off the heat add three cloves of minced garlic stir that in and place it in a bowl to the side you can adjust the salt levels as needed you know i don't even know why these vegetables are so good because i feel like they shouldn't be considering the ingredients but uh anyway we're almost done don't forget to heat up enough corn or flour tortillas for four people i use my flour tortilla recipe which will save you a little money and they're about 10 times better and of course you can add guacamole or pico de gallo but that adds extra cost and in my opinion is fully optional but i do really love a good avocado or guac with this just to be honest now let's see if our fajita meal price to this per serving holds a candle to the rest fajitas we got the meat we got the lime this is beans rice vegetables tortillas and cheese now we forgot to buy cheddar cheese but it would cost this much to have cheese for your vaginas i had no block cheese but what i did have was this giant wheel of conte solid everybody says it's meat and followed by other toppings i would disagree beans are something soft or something that'll squish out you want that on the bottom followed by rice your chicken your fajita veg and finally you're gonna hit it with your cheddar cheese which should be cheddar cheese and a fat little juice of lime hello fold it up you got a taco you have all this for this much per person the chicken assuming that you grilled it it's got that smoky flavor the spices are spicy the rice is punchy tomatoey rich these beans are rich they're anxious there's just like a deep meatiness about them and that chorizo with a little bit of spice and then fajita vegetables you can't go wrong with peppers and onions sweet oniony peppery all wrapped up in a nice tortilla and for a cheap price now that's a fajita meal but cheaper you want to know what else is full of hot juicy thighs and beans b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our fajitas and for a shockingly good price and at the end of the day it comes down to technique that's what the series is all about we make stuff cheap by using technique and paying attention to the flavor you love each and little ingredient give it a little kiss put a little blanket over it tuck it in go to bed and then you know devour its entire body we'll not talk about that this was inappropriate but cheaper we've got cinco de mayo coming up if you're watching it right now as it's being uploaded unless you're watching it in the future future yeah that's all i have to say i mean we made some pretty freaking good fajitas so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave like subscribe [Music] you

When I say homemade, I mean everything. From the fresh brewed milk tea all the way down to the brown sugar syrup and the homemade tapioca pearls,...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, look it's part of my job to show you that anything in the kitchen is possible and boba tea oh it's very possible okay so today we're making boba tea and no i don't just mean the flavor and then we're gonna go get tapioca pearls no no no we are making our own tapioca okay we're making them ourselves from scratch it's very very easy and honestly i'm surprised that more people don't do it because you have complete creative control i always get these questions like josh why should i even make it like why it's so much time and like it's difficult is there even a point uh well first off it's really not that hard second off you're being a little baby you can make any flavor exactly how you want the idea of being able to control the flavor however you want is the power that's all the power and i'd like to give you that power so with all that said let's make this shall we let's cut straight to the chase oh josh but boba pearls have to be hard i mean look at them they're just little men actually no they're super easy to make and they only require a grand total of four ingredients first step we're gonna make the pearls in a small sauce pot add a 30 cup or 78 milliliters of water a third cup or 65 grams of packed brown sugar i highly recommend going by grams here by the way you just gotta trust papa's intuition now heat that liquid to boiling then reduce the heat to low add half your tapioca starch and quickly mix it in for about six to eight seconds then turn off the heat and mix in the remaining half of your tapioca starch mix until thoroughly combined and it begins to form a dough then dump it out onto a work surface and knead it together until you get a beautifully smooth dough just a minute or so now as this dough cools it will firm up so you gotta move quickly now divide your dough into four equal pieces roll each piece into a super long rod that's about half an inch thick cut that log into small cubes like you see here and repeat with the rest then just roll these cubes into nice little balls because the dough is probably gonna start to firm up and cool down here it's always nice to have a helper to speed things up if your dough firms up you can give it a quick three second reheat in the microwave to make it pliable again now once you have a beautiful ocean of balls toss those in a bowl with more tapioca starch to coat toss them around then place them in a fine mesh sieve and shake off the excess to get tons of lightly starch-coated boba pearls at this point they'll cool and firm up quite a bit you can store these in an airtight container and freeze them pretty much indefinitely if you don't want to use them right away but we're using them right away so to cook your boba simply heat a medium pot of water over medium high heat until boiling then add your pearls to the water and boil for 30 minutes then cut the heat and let them rest in the hot water for another 20 to 25 minutes or until translucent and chewy now all those are cooking let's make our brown sugar syrup to a small sauce pot add one and a quarter cup or 250 grams of light brown sugar and six and a half tablespoons or 100 milliliters of water gently swirl that around to hydrate all the sugar with water now just heat that over medium heat until it's dissolved and begins to bubble then increase your heat to medium high and it'll start to boil pretty vigorously so as soon as it's reduced and you start to see large bubbles check it by pouring it onto a plate and if it's nice and syrupy cut the heat and that's your brown sugar syrup now drain your boba pearls in a fine mesh sieve then stir them into your sugar syrup along with one tablespoon or 19 grams of blackstrap molasses and those right there look like some sort of nightmare infinity pool but it's actually a beautiful brown sugar now as usual those balls will shrink a little as they cool and they'll become fully transparent as well okay the hardest part is over next up is the fun moment of choosing your tea we have two versions a traditional brown sugar milk tea and a matcha milk tea for the traditional you can really use any of your favorite black tea here we have three different kinds but i'm gonna go with earl grey because it's yummy to a small saucepan add two cups of whole milk or nut milk yes haha nut milk so funny now heat that over medium heat stirring occasionally until it hits around 162 fahrenheit then immediately remove it from the heat and mix in two tablespoons of loose leaf black tea let that steep for four to eight minutes or until it reaches your desired strength of flavor and strain the tea through a fine mesh trainer to give yourself an infused milk tea now be sure to cool that bad boy down either in the fridge or over an ice bath before using oh by the way you can also make a large batch of this keep it in the fridge for when you want it just pop ideas now to assemble our traditional milk tea simply spoon in as much or as little boba as you like into the bottom of a nice tall glass hit it with a spoonful of some of the syrup or to your taste then add some nice ice cubes always nice ice cubes then pour in your chilled milk tea add in a reusable stainless steel boba straw for the earth friendly flecks but before we taste and get these balls in our mouth let's quickly make a matcha version which is even easier snag yourself two and a half teaspoons or six grams of matcha powder and to that you're going to whisk in about 2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters of hot water it should make a liquidy paste the consistency of heavy cream but if not you can always add a touch more water now you have your matcha concentrate just get another long boy glass drop in your brown sugar boba along with some of its brown sugar syrup your ice cubes then top it with whole milk or yes your nut milk be sure to leave a little bit of room for your matcha concentrate and as you might expect pour your matcha right on top essentially insert your boba straw give it a nice stir and well with nothing left to do here i think it's time that we firmly grasp it and get to sucking the tail of two tea so we have a matcha and we have a regular or brown sugar if i should say that tastes exactly like boba tea i mean this this is great the milk is nice you can really taste the earl grey coming through obviously you can use other teas and then the brown sugar flavor comes through the boba is sweet it's chewy voluptuous i want to mention one thing you've ever gone to a bubble tea shop you bite into the boba and it's good but it's just like crusty on the inside these these are tendy wendy now the matcha version is the same thing but we added sort of like a matcha paste to just regular milk and i still added the brown sugar syrup because i wanted to see what it was gonna be like so okay yo this is the best one easily i've actually never had a matcha boba this is absolutely the moral of the story is if you want to go to a boba tea shop that's fine but if you've ever made it yourself you have complete and total control and uh it's made with like actual ingredients it's kind of a superior option you want to know what else is full of milky balls that you suck straight into your mouth for chewy goodness [Music] b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our boba tea and you know what i was right shocking making it yourself really is honestly so so much better there are a lot of bobo shops out there that are very very good so i don't want to take a poopy on any of them at all absolutely go support your local boba places but you got to try making it yourself because the amount of flavor that you can put into it and doing it from completely whole ingredients instead of just powders is a big w but more specifically the green tea boba with the brown sugar pearls it is the most beautiful combination i've ever had in a boba tea so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] you

missing [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today we're making the mcdonald's egg mcmuffin this has to be one of the most simplified breakfast sandwiches on the market physically possible yet it has an enormous amount of clout as usual it's always the menu items that have so much unnecessary clout you know if you don't know the mcmuffin which i would be shocked if you didn't but it's basically english muffins toasted usually poorly american cheese ham and then this like egg cylinder that's horrifically overcooked it's a hockey puck basically so we're gonna recreate it the best way possible while maintaining that original look and we're gonna win so with all that said let's make this shall we we're back at it again i said this before the other day i heard somebody say macdonald's again stop can i just get one egg mcmuffin i noted this last time but they're really good about speed here i mean obviously that's what they're known for thank you jesus you see that just like him right out he's like muffin okay we have the bag there's a little bit of nostalgia oh my god what is that smell oh you know what's funny is i haven't eaten at all today yet and so just like the idea of food being around me my mouth was starting to water and i was getting hungry when i smelled that all the saliva retracted back into my body was like you need this for something else somebody come sniff this yeah that stinks that is the most accurate thing i've ever heard in my life so we got canadian bacon looks fine american cheese this egg has been here for so long you can see this like little greenish brownish dark color that's because the egg has been sitting cooked for way too long and then it was microwaved it's just boring i mean what do you want me to say it's just it has to be the most boring choice physically possible for breakfast it's easy i get it a lot of people go on the drive through and they're like i'm so hungry i just get a quick one but you never think about it again i wanna make something that you think about forever okay if we're gonna one up a mcmuffin we're probably gonna want to make our own muffin or well english muffin in this case which are not actually called english muffins in england anyway start off with two cups or 480 milliliters of whole milk around 90 to 95 fahrenheit and to that you're going to whisk in two and a half teaspoons or eight grams of instant yeast three and a half tablespoons or 45 grams of granulated sugar whisk it all together until dissolved and let it sit for about five minutes or until frothy now wrassle yourself a stand mixer and to the bowl of that you're gonna add four and a third cup or 675 grams of bread flour and two teaspoons or eight grams of fine sea salt begin mixing that with the dough hook attachment then once incorporated go ahead and add your sugary yeasty milk followed by a quarter cup or 56 grams of very lightly melted butter seriously make sure this butter is just barely melted if it's beyond 100 degrees it'll kill your yeast and papa never forgive you oh and also one whole egg now continue to mix that until it forms a nice smooth dough then lightly grease a bowl if needed you can give your dough a couple slap and fold to help give it some extra strength then shape it into a light bulb pop it into your grease bowl cover with plastic wrap give him a true gentleman's name and let that rise at room temperature for about one hour or until doubled and chunky now take your chunky man and punch all the air out of him then divide the dough into about 15 pieces you can get more precise by weighing the whole dough in grams and dividing that by 15. voila you have your gramage per piece now once you have all your pieces shape each and every one of those into balls place your nice round balls in either a dough proof box or in baking sheet either of which need to be dusted with cornmeal cover with lid and let those rest for 10 minutes now all you got to do is take a ball dust the top and the bottom with cornmeal flatten them so you get a disc about three and a half inches wide and half an inch thick then place them in a griddle or cast iron skillet over medium low heat and let them cook for three to five minutes then flip and let them cook for another three to five minutes or until golden brown and now likely those won't be baked through yet so once that's done place them on a small tray and then into an oven that's been preheated to 350 fahrenheit for about seven to ten more minutes or until baked through then just repeat with all of your english muffins i mean look at these absolute gentlemen wait they actually look like english muffins yes because we gave them our love and [Music] now let those cool in a wire rack completely and that's it now next up let's talk pam sure you could go buy canadian bacon it's already prepped for you instead i've acquired an entire smoked ham i do this so i can slice it to the thickness of my desires i ended up going a half inch thick per slice but wait a minute josh what about the circular shape you're gonna use the circular biscuit cutter the exact same size as your english muffins to then punch out the perfectly sized round of thick cut ham now all you're going to do is heat a medium-sized skillet over medium-high heat hit that with about three tablespoons of vegetable oil and once the oil is hot add in your ham in batches to avoid overcrowding and let it sear for about two minutes you can also use something to weigh it down like the chef press which i love then flip and sear for another two to three minutes now toss in a small bundle of fresh thyme three tablespoons or 42 grams of unsalted butter and baste your ham for about 25 seconds now place your hot ham on a small tray cover it with the time butter and repeat with the rest now before we make the coveted egg let's make a quick spicy mayo which i know is untraditional stop complaining the sandwich needs one okay now get a small bowl and add half a cup or 112 grams of mayonnaise a quarter cup or 60 grams of creme fraiche one tablespoon or eight grams of smoked paprika one tablespoon or nine grams of garlic powder two and a half tablespoons or 37 grams of sriracha and two teaspoons or seven grams of worcestershire sauce awesome now whisk together and that's your spicy mayo wow so easy josh yes i know you're welcome now last but not least we gotta fix this downright depressing so-called egg in the method snack a small non-stick skillet heat it up over medium heat and add just enough unsalted butter to coat the bottom of the pan about one and a half tablespoons or 20 grams as soon as that's melted and bubbling place a ring mold that's been lightly greased and is the same diameter as your english muffins in the center of your pan carefully crack one egg into that mold season the top with salt and let that cook for about 30 seconds or till the white at the bottom begins to set nicely then add three tablespoons or 45 milliliters of water around the mold so it comes to a boil then immediately cover with foil or lid and let that steam for about 45 seconds or until the egg is just cooked through but the yolk is still running now immediately remove that egg from the pan and repeat with however many eggs you need i made five sandwiches so i did five eggs that's the best math i've done this year okay it's time to assemble first get an english muffin fork split it or slice it accordingly give it a nice toast in a toaster i like mine pretty deeply toasted so before anyone's like oh my gosh look i think it's better with a white chart that's just my taste anyway add a nice dollop of your optional spicy mayo spread it around a coat followed by a slice of aged cheddar cheese i like to brush the cheese with my kitchen torch to get it a little melty then add your beautifully runny egg circlette i guess circle sauce the other half of your bread spread it around a coat add your time butter basted thicky cut ham and finally crown your breakfast king now the first gaze upon the sandwich says lord have mercy i'm about to bust more importantly i think we should see the inside of this i mean come on look at this thing don't play with me now let's go ahead and taste test to decide on a winner even though i think we got this one in the bag i hope well well well first off we already won because it's got a juicy yolk all right that's the only way and if you don't like runny yolks that's okay it's okay to be wrong mommy i have two things to say we won and second we won what do i say like the texture of the english muffin is obviously better fresh made flavor is nice it doesn't have that weird like refrigerator flavor there's real cheese on this and you can change what kind of cheese you could do smoked gouda that would be pretty gouda it's actually pronounced cauda and all the dutch people who are watching this are probably like did he just say let's get a taste tester in here so today we have vikram hey we got the stinkiest boy in the game i've cut the other one in half so you can't tell although i think you will right away number one sorry sorry oh my god vikram you missed the whole thing don't eat the whole thing jesus and number two mama is that mama yours is uh this one it's the i think it's the yolk that gives it away well the sauce is like great this is really just you say grape just now i wish i said great okay normally i'm not a fan of uh runny egg but this is like just horrible like this is garbage smoked ham sauce the cheese a very nice all we gotta say is mcdonald's bud better [Music] you want to know what else is full of runny drippy goodness and things that make you open your mouth [Music] b-roll all right guys and that is it so we made our egg mcmuffin i keep wanting to say english muffin i don't know why i mean there's an english muffin in there josh so the point is this was a really easy one to do it really wasn't that difficult to make it better obviously making your own english muffins is a big deal you can make these and use them for anything maybe make eggs benedict which would be a better option in my opinion but that's literally what this is this is like a lazy benedict just without the hollandaise which by the way you can make it in a blender the point is you should absolutely make this as i always say but with all that said if you enjoyed this video

You can do it all and we're going to make that possible...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, you know oftentimes i'm thinking what can i make that people just don't think to make and that story has led us here and we're making everything everything [Music] okay so today we are making yodos greek gyros however you want to say it just don't say gyros okay doesn't that hurt you just hear gyro what are you gyroing your hips this is essentially a flat bread sandwich that consists of pita then meat then tzatziki my brain farted for a second there and various other accoutrement like herbs and or red onion yadda yadda yadda i could talk about this all day but i'd rather get into the world of spinning meat and puffy bread so with all that said let's make this shall we all right we're going all the way homies we got the homemade pita we have the proper gyro being cooked on a rotisserie spit and of course an absolute unit of satsiki right sorry about that let's first begin with our pita start off with three quarters of a cup plus two tablespoons or 207 milliliters of lukewarm water around 95 fahrenheit then to that you're gonna mix in one and a half teaspoons or six grams of instant yeast and one tablespoon or 14 grams of granulated sugar whisk that until dissolved then let the rest of that bloom for about seven minutes then in a small bowl whisk together 2 cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour with 2 teaspoons or 14 grams of fine sea salt then realize a small bowl was a horrible choice and instead do that in a very large bowl excellent work josh a true now right before mixing whisk one tablespoon or 13 grams of extra virgin olive oil into your bloomed yeasty mixture then pour that into your flour mixture and begin mixing the dough by hand and as soon as it forms a dough turn it out onto a work surface and give it a nice knead it will be pretty sticky so picking it up slapping it down and folding it over itself also known as stop and fold wow see how that name kind of just sounds similar what the frick anyway this is an easier tactic to knead the dough now go ahead and slap and fold it for about one to three minutes or until smooth but not tearing then spray a medium sized bowl with cooking spray shape your dough into a light bowl and carefully place it into your bowl cover with greased plastic wrap and let that rise for one hour or until doubled now as that's rising you should do two things first you should pop a pizza stone into your oven and begin preheating it to its maximum temp at least 475 or 500 fahrenheit yes it needs to heat the stone for over an hour otherwise papa will be very big sad now while that's doing its thing let's prep our meat yes joshi has the meat now first you'll need three to four pounds of boneless pork shoulder and about one and a half pounds of skinless pork belly start by slicing your pork shoulder in a half inch thick slices all the way down that brother and for the pork belly you'll likely need to cut it into two even segments then slice those into half inch pieces as well sort of like half bacons oh look at them being cute and ready to be consumed now for the spice mix snag a small bowl and combine get ready for this one tablespoon of 13 grams of smoked paprika 1 tablespoon or 11 grams of garlic powder 1 tablespoon or 8 grams of ground cumin one tablespoon or three grams of dried oregano one tablespoon or four grams of finely chopped fresh thyme one tablespoon or 14 grams of granulated sugar and two tablespoons or 19 grams of kosher salt now give that some whiskey business and that's your gyro meat spice it's a lot but don't skip any of these if you want it to taste absolutely mad brava now place all your sliced meat in a container in single layers seasoning each layer as you go until you've added all the meat then add the rest of your seasoning and gently toss together finally add in three tablespoons or 45 grams of white distilled vinegar toss again until everything is thoroughly coated i do it in layers to make this easier to coat with seasoning and you know without treading the meat to bits from violently tossing it around for too long now look i bought this big rotisserie shawarma gyro roast meat thing which honestly i highly recommend and the link is in the bio and i'm going to explain how to use it but if you need an alternative then you can always use the method in my al pastor recipe and the link is in the bio for that skewer grill method now anyway stack your meat all the way up papa's big rod alternating pork shoulder and belly until all of your meat is used and it comes up to the tippy top if you're using a rotisserie like mine be sure to fix your prong holster on the top as well and that is your beautiful log of meat isn't it gorgeous gazing upon it feels no different than staring at the great mountains forged by mother nature now pop your fat meat log onto your rotisserie and head to the great outdoors for safety turn on your electric spindle heat the grills to about medium low if it gives that option hopefully then all you gotta do is let it rotate and cook from anywhere between one to three hours checking in it often and once the outside starts to fully cook you can begin shaving it just be sure to avoid burning it as you do this and really that's all there is to it this machine does the work for you and it's one of my greatest investments yet okay our rotisserie is going it's time to finish the pita get your fully grown dough punch the life out of it and turn it onto a lightly floured work surface and cut it into six equal pieces if you're extra like me those pieces will be about 75 grams each now gently take your dough babies and form them into light balls and place them in a lightly floured container where they have some space top that with the lid and let them rest for 30 minutes covered obviously to shape and bake take one of your nice balls lightly flour it press it down to form a fat disc that's disc folks then roll it out into a six inch disc it's about a third of an inch thick or so make sure to measure your disc so everyone is happy with your size transfer to a small piece of parchment about the same size as the disc you can always cut the parchment to proportion if needed then repeat with the rest of your nice little balls so doing this three to four at a time place your discs on a pizza peel and carefully slide them onto your heated pizza stone making sure they're separated and bake for two to three minutes you know they're done when they're puffed beautifully and are a light golden color remove them transfer them to a tea towel to keep warm then repeat with the rest of your beautiful pitas that are so fluffy you might as well lay your head on them and enter an eternal slumber well maybe not eternal like a 20-minute nap or something next make a quick satsiki by just combining one and a half cups or 350 grams of greek yogurt half a large english cucumber that's been finely diced one tablespoon of finely chopped parsley one tablespoon of finely chopped dill one tablespoon of finely chopped mint the zest of one whole lemon three cloves of grated garlic and the juice from the lemon you just zested season that the taste with salt give it a nice little mix and that is yours now if you're adding tomatoes do me a favor and please slice them thinly and nicely and season them with salt and let them sit for a few minutes to cure before using them trust me it's life changing now we can finally assemble first slice your meat fresh and hot hot hot from the spindle always you know just get as much as you need to serve now take a big fat pita flatten it and yes obviously you can stuff this but i've always seen it wrapped like a taco so you know to each their own now add in your juicy meat a nice dollop of satsiki some sliced and ideally cured tomatoes additional diced cucumber an even mix of fresh parsley fresh mint and fresh dill and finally some very thinly sliced red onion which ideally has been sliced paper thin and ran under some cold tap water to remove some of its bitter spiciness but retain its sweetness and that right there is the most bodacious voluptuous and nearly sensual gyros i've ever seen now let's see if all this work was truly worth it [Music] [Music] so we have our gyro now homemade pita homemade meat i mean come on we put it on the spindle and everything do you have to go that far of course not we blew it out of the water what am i supposed to say when i bit into this my brain had so many things going off at once that for some reason the very moment that i tasted it my brain just immediately went yeah squidward i'm just being completely transparent with you guys oh look at me look at me the meat is ridiculous i know it's ridiculous because well i tasted it and it's insanely good but i also saw vikram's reaction he took one bite he had to walk it off that's how good it was the pita itself soft fluffy chewy terrible look at this oh my god and also by the way guess what there's a pocket inside too all right so this is a big fat w and if you want to make your own euros and you've never done it before this is the guide for you you have every tool you could possibly need and you get out there and you go do it you do for papa love you you want to know what else is full of fat meat logs and big bread pockets b-roll [Music] [Music] or guys and that is it so we made our yiddish and they turned out beautifully beautifully first off that pita was it was perfect now before anyone gets mad i'm like josh what the you didn't stuff the pita you idiot well first off okay i've always seen it just put on top and then folded like a taco almost that's how i've always seen it done now you can absolutely stuff them if you'd like and you could see that there was a pocket to stuff them in so hey live your life however you want and if you want to tell somebody else how to live their life maybe you should re-analyze where you are and just stop this has been pita pocket thoughts with josh it was delicious you should make it if you want to just make your own pita and then make the meat some other way like on the grill that's totally fine you could do it that way no problem at all pick something out of this or do the whole darn thing you're not going to regret it so with all this said if you enjoyed this video

Today we're taking on the challenge of making them completely from scratch, and unbelievably better.

Recipe: https://www.joshuaweissma...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, ah yes childhood nostalgia you thought you were safe from this series you're not [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today we are making dino nuggies you know them you love them or maybe you don't love them i don't these are literally just chicken nuggets in the shape of dinosaurs it's been requested over and over so i'm just gonna freaking do it since everyone keeps asking for it but please understand that's what they are now getting to the point of shaping them into that now that's its own issue so with all that said let's make this shall we we got the box wow look at this dino nuggies back from childhood it's not like a fart over here how did that happen hey yo who farted what are we doing what are we doing it smells like a facility in there now let's bake these [Music] alrighty tidy folks we got fried things should just you know when they're fried and not and you don't need them just don't do this the grease i lightly dabbed it with my finger unnecessary these did not get crispy at all your chicken nuggets should not eat it they shouldn't wag their tail at you all right it's not a dog it's a chicken nugget these are a little too hot to eat yeah heat them up in 10 minutes but wait 40 minutes for them to cool can somebody come smell this for me i don't know it doesn't smell like chicken it smells like that old rag that you use like yesterday morning and you just leave it in the corner and then you're like oh i should probably take care of that but then you don't and then about a week later you're like what's that rag doing there and then you smell it you're like oh i gotta put this in the wash i'm gonna swallow it okay i'm gonna swallow it i swear this is just trash i mean this is this is like the lowest tier of food physically possible this has to be the worst that i've tasted even the mcdonald's filet of fish i would take that over this ten times they throw a whole chicken in a grinder put it form these and they're like yeah get your kids i'll eat this by the way right in the parents face and their parents like here sweetie let me support the companies that are doing this do i have to say more i mean this is bad we could yes of course we could do better than this and i'm gonna show you how we do better okay so we're first gonna make our chicken mix that sounds exciting doesn't it chicken mix i haven't seen the light outside in years now you can absolutely just buy ground chicken which you'll need about two pounds but i prefer to grind it myself for the culinary collection snack four nice boneless skin on chicken breasts yes we want the skin but well first actually remove all the skin then cut the breast into half inch thick strips place them in a bowl then rough chop all that chicky skin now again if you're not grinding it yourself you'll need to buy something with chicken skin take it off and finally chop it with a knife which ends up being around a quarter cup see this is why i grind my own listen to papa now to your chicken add two and a half teaspoons of kosher salt one tablespoon of smoked paprika one tablespoon of garlic powder two teaspoons of nutritional yeast two teaspoons of miso paste and one tablespoon of duck fat or pork fat now mix all that together until thoroughly combined into a beautiful meaty mess just like my saturday nights now all you gotta do is run that through a meat grinder which if you have a kitchenaid stand mixer you can get this attachment for like 40 bucks lincoln de bio brother also i'm wearing my mask here because i wanted to see how cute the flowers were on it isn't it so nice now once that's ground give it a nice mix by hand until beautifully homogenized next get yourself a quarter sheet tray or something of equal size spray it lightly with cooking spray line it with wax paper give your wax paper a light spritz of then add your chicken and press it evenly into your tray and when i say even i mean even press it firmly and keep it then once that's pressed pop that in the freezer for 30 to 45 minutes or until very firm now while that's freezing let's make a quick spicy chili crisp barbecue sauce yes you heard me right in a medium-sized sauce pot add one sweet onion that's been grated and to that you're gonna add a quarter cup of granulated sugar one cup of ketchup a quarter cup of tomato paste three tablespoons of sriracha a quarter cup of molasses and a quarter cup of worcestershire sauce that's pretty close that was a good one oh and lastly half cup of vinegar this is chinese black vinegar but you can also just use plain white vinegar up to you now give it a stir pop that bad boy in the stove bring it to a boil over medium high heat and as soon as it reaches that boil immediately reduce the temp to low and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes or until reduced about 25 then stream that through a mesh drainer let it cool and finally mix in two and a half tablespoons of the solids from a jar of spicy chili crisp i like to pulverize mine a little to get it finer but that's optional and well so is the spicy chili crisp entirely i just like to add it because it's gemmy now our next steps are real easy get yourself a five quart heavy bottom pot filled with at least two inches of frying oil heat that bad boy to 350 degrees fahrenheit then get your firm block of chicken out of the freezer invert it onto a cutting board peel off the wax paper oh and by the way this is misshapen because papa had a little accident before but that's fine we won't talk about that anyway using dinosaur-shaped cookie cutters press and punch out as many little dinos as you can this can get messy so you may need to freeze intermittently as you go now once your nookies are punched and you have your meaty chickeny dinosaurs pop them on a tray and place them back in the freezer to firm up for 10 more minutes now we're gonna prepare our katsu style bread station you're gonna need one bowl with a cup of all-purpose flour another bowl with one cup of panko bread crumbs and a third bowl oh look josh doing that with the eggs very cool thank you two eggs cracked into a bowl whisk together with a splash of water until thoroughly combined now pull your dinos out of the freezer into bread them all you gotta do is gently toss your horrifying reptilian monster in the flower to coat thoroughly shake off the excess gently then toss into the egg mixture to fully coat and finally toss in the panko bread crumbs until you get a panko dinosaur oh little pants man then repeat that process with all of your dinos take them to your oil and fry about three to four dinos at a time for about five minutes or until they reach a beautiful rich brown quip and the inside is just cooked through once they're finished place those on a wire rack to drain and repeat with the rest and i mean look at these two feathers be honest with me which one do you want now let's give this a taste test to find out the true winner of childhood nostalgia okay this is kind of reminiscent of a chicken katsu it almost smells like it too got a barbecue sauce we've one up the ketchup sound test you heard it here fellas god damn this is really good are you kidding me bro obviously i think we won first off almost lacy on the outside katsu style crust they're salted perfectly they're juicy there's a little bit of spice the original ones are devoid of any level of crisp and obviously this barbecue sauce is just like a whole other level even without it it would be good it would be great with ketchup if you want to go that route all right i'm not going to judge you they're dino nuggets dip them in whatever you want but this barbecue sauce is that's all i have to say about it tj i need you to step in we have nuggie inaudible two nuggies i reheated these by the way for the record nuggy one and nuggy two here's nuggie one that's nuggy we'll say that's nuggy one sure nuggy one we just reversed it all of a sudden there's nothing one okay that's like clear this as soon as like i felt it in my hand i felt like i was like in an elementary school cafeteria i do want to try this sauce though i've been eyeing this all day that means a win yet again but better episode we don't even do it anymore episode pp okay because we're we're eating children's food so we're going to talk about like children but better you want to know what else is in the shape of an animal that you also eat well at the risk of sounding a touch morbid actually there are many things but um b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our dinosaur chicken nuggets was it annoying yes was it good absolutely would i do it again yes i would but i wouldn't shape them into dinosaurs because it serves absolutely no purpose i think what would be good is if you press them in that pan and then dump it out and cut them into like nice rectangles or cubes but that would be up to you but what i really want you to know is that the actual texture the crunch the lacy crunch on the outside and that soft voice inside i mean it was perfect i was a big fan and i'm glad i did it and i will do it again just not the shape of dinosaurs but hey so anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] you

And this guide has it all, from crispy fried chicken, yeasted...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, so if you've never had chicken and waffles or you've never made it well then buddy you came to the right place [Music] okay so today we're making chicken and waffles this is the holy grail of southern cuisine well maybe not the holy holy grail i'm sure that there's a lot of opinions about that but the point is that this is an iconic choice if you've never heard of it it might sound a little weird trust me this is one of those things where when you put it together it just creates something special it's exactly what it sounds like it's beautifully fried chicken cradle to top a voluptuous chewy fluffy waffle and then drenched in syrup but in this case we'll be making a honey butter so with all that said let's make this shall we okay let's break this down into a couple different easy pieces de chicky waffles and your choice of drizzle also a surprise sandwich at the end but your lips baby girl we'll get into that later now let's start with the chicken the traditional choice would be to use a whole chicken that's been cut into eight pieces your butcher can do this or you can do it yourself like i usually prefer because obviously we have to flex here you first open up the legs by cutting the skin that attaches to the body then remove the whole leg quarter on both sides then work around the wing to remove it where the joint connects to the body repeat on the other then carefully split the breasts in half by cutting straight through the breastbone to leave two bone-in skin-on chicken breasts i really recommend using a beater knife there they'll just use your favorite japanese blade alright and lastly separate the drumstick from the thigh cutting through the joint in between and now you have a segmented little man now for your marinade get a large bowl and add one and a half cups of buttermilk one tablespoon of smoked paprika one tablespoon of garlic powder two teaspoons of cayenne two teaspoons of ground white pepper and one tablespoon of kosher salt whisk that together until thoroughly combined then add your chicken pieces to enjoy a nice milky bath for at least one hour and up to 24 hours now while that's marinating let's do our waffles in a medium sized bowl add one and a half cups of whole milk at 95 fahrenheit mix in one and a half teaspoons of instant yeast then set that to the side and in a large bowl crack two whole eggs and one egg yolk and by the way yes there are more ingredients in here i doubled the recipe for this video and i'm not exactly sure why so let's just pretend uh that we're listening to what i'm saying and the visual is yeah anyway whisk all that together until homogeneous then whisk in your yeasty milk mixture until thoroughly combined and finally whisk in 1 3 of a cup of gently melted unsalted butter make sure it's not piping hot we want it just melted if it's too hot it'll kill the yeast and you get no waffles and papa no hug you now in a large bowl add two cups of all-purpose flour two tablespoons of granulated sugar and one teaspoon of kosher salt whisk that together until thoroughly combined then simply whisk the wet into the dry and keep on mixing until nice and smooth and that is your waffle batter now wrap that up in plastic wrap and let it rest and rise for one hour before using you can also rise them overnight in the fridge for 24 hours now the waffles cook quickly so let's fry our chicken next unless you want cold ass waffles for the dredge get a medium bowl and add two cups of all-purpose flour two teaspoons of cayenne powder two teaspoons of ground ginger powder one tablespoon of smoked paprika two teaspoons of ground white pepper one tablespoon of garlic powder and one tablespoon of kosher salt whisk that together until thoroughly combined and that is your flour dredge now to fry your chicken you'll need at least two and a half inches of vegetable oil in a large heavy bottom pot heat that bad boy to 350 fahrenheit then while that's heating set your dredge station up you've got your chicken you've got your flour and obviously you have your fry oil before you even toss your chicken in the flour take about three tablespoons of your butt milk mixture and drizzle it into your flour and toss vigorously to create some randomized little balls of flour in there now from there remove your chicken toss in the flour while also pressing the flour aggressively into every little crevice to make sure it's coated evenly and nicely now shake off the excess place your chicken on a baking sheet and repeat with the rest of your chicken until everything is beautifully breaded then just tenderly and carefully lay your chicken into the oil away from you and fry three to four pieces at a time for 12 to 15 minutes until the chicken registers 165 fahrenheit and the outside is a beautiful golden brown then remove your crispy gentlemen using tongs and drain them on a wire rack set over a baking sheet then simply repeat with the rest i mean look at this chicken the first piece that emerged from the oil my immediate thought was oh lord i have mercy i'm about to bust okay now we can start cooking our waffles by now the batter should have risen quite a bit which is a good thing all that rice will give it a nice little yeasty flavor the good kind heat a belgian waffle maker to the manufacturer's directions spray it lightly with cooking spray and add about three quarters of a cup or one cup of batter to the center close it gently giving it a little press then let it cook for the recommended time once it's done open it up and voila a little baby now pop that babe out of there and repeat with the rest of your batter to go to the waffle district of flavor okay we have our waffles and our chicken but i also think we need one more thing honey butter in a small pan add a quarter cup of wildflower honey or any light honey of your choice heat that over medium heat until warm and starting to get a little runny then whisk in two tablespoons of cold salted butter yes salted then turn off the heat and continue whisking constantly until emulsified beautifully and it looks like this that is a salty honey butter now we're ready for the moment of truth first thing waffle down on the plate next a beautiful selection of the crunchiest chicken followed by an absolute drenching of your honey butter i mean really don't be shy here and optionally but also recommended a nice drizzle of maple syrup even better if it's smoked maple syrup for a nice campfire type beat now that looks like a party for just about anyone's mouth but let's see if it's as good as it looks so we have our chicon this has actually been sitting with syrup and honey butter on it we did both the honey butter and the syrup on this obviously you can go one or the other and choose your own adventure right make decisions for yourself this has been sitting with all that this has been sitting with all that on it and i'm curious to see if it still has crunch i'm not sure it may not let's find out i'm gonna say it still has crunch this is immaculate this is the kind of thing that when you eat it you're sweating and you feel ill but you don't stop because it's so yummy okay so pretty much the way that you would eat something like this if nobody's ever had this before get a little bit of waffle you know some of the syrup and this is how i like to eat it okay everybody eats a different little piece of chicken that goes on the waffle you have a bite of everything bona lap um bone apple teeth it's all the textures you want me finish eating this it's got all the textures you want it's crunchy it's salty it's sweet it's rich it's there's no cut to the richness at all the sweetness is the only thing that brings you home and to be honest i'm not mad about it this this is a proper chicken and waffle but can't we make something a little bit different maybe a little bit of garlic we're making garlic bread waffle chicken sandwiches if you're not watching the next thing they get the hell out of here we have one wild card for you here a garlic waffle fried chicken sandwich now the chicken and waffle batter is the exact same recipe as before you marinate bread and fry your chicken except this time you're just gonna use two pounds of boneless skinless chicken thighs and those will fry in more like eight to ten minutes instead of 12 to 15. now once those are fried for the waffles you'll make the batter as normal but this time you want to ideally cook them in a smaller waffle iron that's about the size of a bun or like a slice of bread see where i'm going here oh look how cute it is little baby infant pants man waffle iron now this little guy took about a quarter cup of batter and i didn't have any way to control the temp so i just closed the lid prayed that it would work and made some garlic butter by combining a third cup of salted butter in a small pot heated that over medium heat until completely melted then removed it from the heat and added four cloves of finely minced garlic stirred that together let it cool just slightly and then stirred in two tablespoons of very finely chopped parsley once my waffle was done i pulled it out gave it a generous brushing of my garlic butter on both sides always both sides then just rinsed and repeated with the rest of my baby waffles obviously you'll need like two waffles per sandwich just account for that now finally to assemble your sandwich get one garlic waffle place your fried chicken atop then top your fried chicken with a nice dollop of spicy honey mustard which by the way i made my own by combining half a cup of whole grain spicy mustard one teaspoon of cayenne powder one teaspoon of salt and two tablespoons of honey whisk that all together and well that's what went on there anyway back to the chicken so the spoonful of honey mustard goes right on top then grab your other garlic waffle and carefully crown your king for a very beautiful time now obviously you could add some swiss cheese and maybe some bacon to this but i have a feeling we're gonna have a beauty and simplicity moment here yay sandwich time sandwich time yay i don't even know if this is still crispy anymore we might have did something here i didn't think this was gonna be that good basically what you get here is you lose a little bit of the crisp but you in return you get this like buttery rich garlicky chew in the waffle obviously the rich crispy chicken it's a little spicy and sweet from the honey mustard which we added what more do you want me to say this isn't terribly different from the chicken waffle concept but we're just raising the bar we're making it savory and we're making it a sandwich which if you already made the batter and you got it sitting around you should 100 percent make this sandwich or make the chicken waffles or maybe you decide what you want or don't make it at all i feel like a lot of you are lurkers point is chicken and waffles perfectly done as you saw i would recommend not eating these for breakfast unless you want to go to sleep immediately afterwards you want to know what else has a nice set of thighs glazed and dripping [Music] b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our chicken and waffles the chicken was creepy the waffles were fluffy and that honey butter was just absolutely [Music] i did a lot of singing on this channel recently and not mad about it what do you guys think huh can i can i get a rating can i get a uh that oh wow that's pretty good i don't know what whether the editors are gonna put something in there uh is the sun done the sun cannot figure out where it wants to be today i love texas the point is you should definitely make it if you never have before regardless of if you've had it or not i'm telling you this is life-changing so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe

I'm talking about the gourmet ramen that costs $15 or more for a single bowl! That's just unacceptable so I'll show you how to make homemade gourmet...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, hang on i know you're thinking josh ramen's usually cheap i'm not talking about instant ramen today maybe later i'm talking about the gourmet ramen that usually costs this per bowl when in reality you could make something yourself that costs this purple that is but cheaper [Music] okay so i know i said we're not going to talk about instant ramen obviously we will but that's going to be at the end the thing we really want to focus on is i want to make a nice proper bowl of ramen more specifically we're making a miso pork ramen for my god wow that's so small look how small it is i'm looking at it it's right there and it's so small a proper bowl of ramen isn't just satisfying it's an all-encompassing beautiful thing the experience of eating it shoving it in your face and it's just so good every single bite there's a little bit of something different in every bite so with all that said let's make this shall we right oh let's begin with our miso ramen broth first get a 5 quart heavy bottom pot or something similar it's not like the broth is gonna explode just because your pot is in five quarts anyway heat that over medium high heat completely dry until it's hot hot hot wow then add in half a pound or 225 grams of ground pork ideally you want something on the fattier side like 70 75 flatten and spread that out and let it sear for two to three minutes then flip and it should be a beautifully golden brown repeat that sear on the other side then break it up into small pieces and continue to sear until the pork is fully cooked and has rendered out quite a bit of fat once it reaches that point remove the pork and set it to the side now lure your pot heat to medium then add two medium shallots that have been finely diced seven cloves of finely minced garlic and a three inch knob of ginger that's been grated saute that for about three minutes stirring occasionally until all the veg is softened and is nice and fragrant then add one tablespoon or 14 grams of granulated sugar stir and cook that just until dissolved about one minute now add mr piggy back to the pot followed by one and a half tablespoons or 14 grams of ground toasted sesame seeds yes literally just sesame seeds that have been toasted till golden i did them in a pan and ground in a mortar and pestle till it reaches a powder you can also chop it with a knife if you don't have you know a fancy mortar and pestle i get it now stir that in then add 4 tablespoons or 60 grams of miso paste this can be yellow or red miso there are cheap options out there now stir all that together then add five and a half cups or one and a third liters of chicken stock which ideally is homemade right you know upset papa with store-bought right now this is totally optional but you can also add one tablespoon or 13 grams of han dashi granules again optional but it'll be extra awesome if you add it now let that come to a very light simmer then immediately cover it with a lid and keep it warm until ready to use by the way don't simmer the broth okay just literally keep it hot no simmering no bubbling just hot okay and that is your broth now we need to make arguably the most important part the toppings now let's talk brown butter corn i know some people are gonna whine oh i'm a little baby you know like corn in my ramen okay then don't add it more for us cool people in a medium sauce pot add 3 tablespoons or 42 grams of unsalted butter heat that over medium let that melt and cook until it begins to lightly brown you can certainly take it much further than this but i wanted a very light toasted flavor so i stopped here then immediately add half a cup of fresh corn kernels i prefer to cut them fresh off the cob but you know that's just me stir that into your butter and let that heat just until the corn is hot do not let these sit and cook in the butter i'm sick of the mushy corn out there today okay let's please just get some poppin juicy corn that's just hot i want a little bit of pepper in this okay season the taste with salt and that is your corn next up a beautifully quick soft-boiled egg obviously these are not marinated eggs and you can certainly marinate them but if you do that it's going to add time and price to this recipe so simply bring a sauce pot of water to a gentle boil then add your eggs and boil without a lid for seven minutes somehow these seven minutes are always the longest seven minutes ever immediately remove them from the water and place them in an ice bath to chill just until the eggs cool down enough to be warm but not ice cold about two minutes then just peel your eggs under running water to help the shells come off and that is a soft boiled egg right there i mean look at the lucy it's sad now last but not least is your ramen noodles please try to find straight ramen noodles if you can then just lower them into a pot of boiling water and boil them according to the package directions then drain them into a small colander and as a side note try not to cook them all the way to mushy you kind of want a pretty thorough al dente otherwise the noodles will overcook when you add the broth okay we have our toppings but before we assemble i want to show you one important trick with green onions of course we can slice them thin but it'd be a whole lot cooler if you take a green onion and then cut it along the green part at a very very steep bias and simply slice as thinly as you can and you'll end up with beautiful fine long threads of green onion then immediately dunk those in ice water and toss them around the sweater will wash off their abrasive flavors and it'll make them a little bit curly and they look so cute oh wow look at the little curly babies uh sometimes in restaurants people will call these green onion pubes and i'd like to just make this my call for y'all to stop it please okay it's nasty now it's assembly time get yourself a bowl and add your cooked nudes top that with your hot broth and some of the ground meat which will sort of naturally fall onto the broth anyway then add a generous couple of spoonfuls of your hot brown butter corn along with some of its butter a nice handful of thinly sliced green onion see doesn't it look so elegant that way then your runny soft cooked egg some additional toasted sesame seeds and optionally a couple of little squares of nori that have been cut out of a well a whole sheet of dory and that's it that is your beautiful bowl of ramen coming in at this price per bowl and this is a big bowl tell you right now brother that's a big freaking dub compared to what you would usually spend not to mention you have total freaking control okay so i mean look at this look at this got dang thing brother all this right here for this price oh hold on fellas i mean look at the broth the broth is like nice and creamy from the fat and the miso and it's just so looks so yummy yes yes i would pay twenty dollars for this easy it tastes just like a classic miso ramen it's salty it's rich with umami you got the fattiness from the pork some of that butter flavor with the corn and the butter plays really nicely the sweetness the crunch the egg it's meaty it's anxious mommy i already said it two times umami this is a proper ramen for an affordable price and it's not instant ramen this is the real but with that said i do think we should make an iteration of instant ramen which we're gonna do right now now i have another idea if you want to go even cheaper you could literally just take a packet of instant ramen noodles whichever your favorite is and by the way if you ever go to an asian grocery store you'll notice that there's a wonderland of dozens of instant ramen varieties papa tip for the day cook it according to the package directions and literally just top it with all the toppings that we've made here and hey maybe hit it with a little bit of chili oil because now your budget might allow it dang this actually does look pretty busting already i'm kind of annoyed how good this looks so this is obviously gonna save you money and time but i have a sneaky suspicion you may sacrifice in the flavor department or will you i think we need to have a little ramen stand off and see which one is the better one here dang is this like a butt better and a butt cheaper one [Applause] [Music] damn i'm a little bit annoyed at how good this looks because the other one took time and this one didn't look at the end of the day to make the actual soup base of this is not that much more additional time it's like maybe an extra 20 minutes i don't know why i'm throwing this out the window without even tasting it already you know what it's not as good right off the bat i can't believe i'm saying this i actually thought this was going to be just as good or if not better because it's you know instant ramen's always good no it's literally not as good guys we outdid instant ramen today on a butt cheaper this isn't even above better but now it is it's like but cheaper and what better with the songs combined we've made history on this show we defeated instant ramen and butt cheapered it although well this is probably cheaper isn't it it doesn't matter it doesn't matter the point is this is still cheap for a homemade ramen look at the end of the day whether you choose your instant ramen counterpart or you want to make it yourself i don't care man just elevate it a little bit think a little bit and you yourself very easily could have the best bowl of ramen you've ever made right here you want to know what else has a hot bowl of nudes and papa's hot miso juice b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so did it brother we made a miso ramen a pork miso ramen that i think almost falls a little bit in line with the tonkotsu and by that i mean it's got that creaminess to it but you didn't have to wait hours and hours and hours because you kind of cut your way through the line of time using ground pork that's the key ingredient here as well as obviously the miso now miso is expensive i know i know but you use only a little bit you get a big chunky container of miso and you can use that miso in perpetuity so don't be like josh i have to go buy miso for the sake of my veggie unless you use that miso and then you have like 95 percent of it remaining and you throw it in the trash no no it did not cost that much to make it so anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a

Yes, it's simple but more importantly, latkes are the easiest potato recipe...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, okay some of us like french fries potato chips tater tots there's all sorts of ways but we're forgetting about one very important contender that is arguably the most versatile okay so today we are making latkes it's not quite timed very well i had the idea i really wanted to make them and eat them so here we are if you want to make them for the appropriate time to eat latkes then guess what you have the free will to do so but here they are nonetheless these are potato pancakes now right off the top of the dome if you've never had them before kind of sounds you need to be yucky but the reality of this scenario is these are the greatest vehicles for so many flavors the iconic way to eat is with sour cream and applesauce it's a weird combo trust me i'm going to be doing three different iterations all of which are gonna be completely different so with all that said let's make this shall we all right we have three latkes for you we have mr traditional with as you may know appi sauce and queenie sour uh cream gravloxing creme fresh and finally a specialty kimchi bonito latke now let's begin with mr traditional before we even make our base you better believe we're making our own fuji applesauce nope no way around it you gotta make it if you want to change your life it's real easy get four large fuji apples peel them all nicely cut off their cheeks getting as close to the core as possible or you know use a core thingy not to be confused with korra which is a show cut your apple into half inch thick slices and try to keep them nice and even to that you're going to add a 30 cup of granulated sugar half a teaspoon of garam masala or ground cinnamon if you want to be vanilla that's okay toss it around a coat then add one cup of filtered water place it on the stove over a medium high bring it to a boil reduce the heat to medium then cover it with a lid or foil you can never find my freaking lids and cook for 15 to 20 minutes or until extremely soft and mushy then pour all that into a blender blend it on high speed until beautifully smooth pour that into a bowl and let it cool completely that's it that is your applesauce i mean look how perfect it is now next up is our latke base start by peeling three pounds of beautifully rotund and smooth rusted potatoes grate all those bad boys and toss them into a large bowl along with one sweet onion that has been peeled and grated as well be sure to move quickly here because the potatoes are gonna get too oxidized and brown and that's yucky and i don't like it with the speed try not to nick yourself with the grater it sucks trust me i would know now to the vegetables add one tablespoon of kosher salt toss to thoroughly coat give them a nice squeeze while tossing and from there get a clean dish towel add your potatoes to the center of the towel gather all the edges like you're picking up a nap sack full of freshly hunted truffles on a dewy french morning or maybe a sack of cash or whatever floats your boat oh she's a little juicy now holding that over your sink wring out as much liquid as you can really squeeze that absolute unit until there's no more drippy drippy now from there place your potatoes into a bowl wow look it looks kind of like some sort of potato wellington somehow to that you're gonna add two large eggs toss that together to thoroughly combine then add one third of a cup of fine panko breadcrumbs toss that together until thoroughly combined and that is your latke base now if it's done right it should hold together into a nice formed patty pretty easily if not then just add an additional tablespoon of panko to shape these simply grab a heaping third cup of your potato mixture and gently form and press that into a puck about three quarters of an inch thick and four and a half inches wide the sizing doesn't really need to be that perfect these are just parameters for all you people who like to complain now repeat that with all of your potatoes and you'll get anywhere between eight to twelve latkes depending on their size now from there get a large deep heavy bottom pan add three tablespoons of chicken fat or duck fat and two tablespoons of neutral tasting oil once the oil is shimmering and very hot add in three to four latkes at a time making sure they don't touch at all then just let those shallow fry for two to four minutes or until a beautifully golden brown then simply flip each and every succulent discus and repeat on the other side they should be crisp on both sides and soft on the inside that's the goal here now once those are done place on a wire rack to drain season immediately with a touch of kosher salt while they're still piping hot now all you need to do is pop one on a plate hit it with a fat quinel of sour cream or even creme fraiche if you want something a little more sorry this one is actually creme fraiche but what else would you expect from me follow that up with another equally sizable quinel of your applesauce from earlier and look at that i mean isn't she lovely wanna kiss it let's make one other quick iteration get another freshly made potato latke hit it with an absolutely monstrous quinell of creme fraiche layer on some lovely gravlox to your heart's desire then hit it with some very thinly sliced chives fresh cracked black pepper and screw it maybe a little bit of flaky salt why not boop bop those are two of the classiest iterations but let's look at one more less by the book version first we need a spicy mayo so start with half a cup of mayonnaise and to that you're gonna add one and a half teaspoons of gochujang one heaping tablespoon of the solids from some spicy chili crisp yeah we're getting a little nasty whisk it all together until thoroughly combined and then add sriracha to taste this one i added about two and a half tablespoons mix again and that right there is a lovely simple spicy mayo now for the latke itself you're simply gonna make the traditional potato base that we did before but to that you're gonna add three quarters of a cup of drained and rough chopped kimchi toss all that in and you shouldn't really need any additional biner but if you do you could always just add a touch more panko then just fry these guys the same exact way as the other ones shallow fry flip enjoy its caramelized crunchy kimchi beauty transfer to a wire rack to drain now to assemble this failure place your kimchi laka on a plate hit it with a nice drizzle of your spicy mayo a nice bit of toasted sesame seeds a beautiful layer of very thinly sliced green onion i mean real thin i sliced this guy on a pretty steep bias super thinly and finally a generous sprinkle of bonito flakes now that is a beautiful kimchi latke if there ever even was one is this even legal this is allowed i'm about to get yelled at for this i know it i just know it now we have all of our beautiful latke variations that we've made here today now let's see which of these three are the best so we have our latkas the traditional lakka onion potato very simple beautiful and then we have our kimchi latke which is sort of inspired by okonomiyaki hence this individual taste test brings me back to my childhood perfection and then the kimchi latke i actually almost prefer this it straddles the world of tradition and just a little bit of a culinary taste and that's what i like this is the most traditional latke you'll ever see a sour cream or creme fraiche and applesauce it's the only way any first-time lacquer eater should ever eat a freaking latke if you don't start like this papa no kiss no hug papa don't even look at you holy i don't even want to describe it to you because i'm forcing you to try this to understand it next i feel like a new man after tasting that we're in another planet smokey bonito flakes the creamy spicy chili i can't even talk right now it's so good last but not least it's a smoked salmon one this one is so straightforward i don't know how good it can really be because i know exactly what it's going to taste like if you've ever been to new york and you've never had a smoked salmon latke with prime fresh this is your greatest introduction ever bro and i look i know i do chives all the time all right and guess what they're still gummy my main point is you can use this as a vehicle for many many flavors you could have it be very culturally diverse or really simple like this and it's going to be good either way that is the power of a latke you're welcome you want to know what else is full of crunchy potatoes smothered in papa's cream b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our latkes three different ways these are one of my favorite things of all time it's near and dear to my heart i'm sharing it with you there are other ways to make them so anyone in the comments who's like wait a minute i don't do it but i do congratulations what do you want metal all that matters is that they are gemmy after tasting all these three i still think that applesauce and sour cream is just the undefeated king of toppings for this but that's a big butt a big juicy butt that kimchi latke that was something real special and i'm never gonna forget it and if you're locker fan you need to make that one right away so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time papa very sorry that he posted this at a weird time okay it's a little weird [Music]

The decision is up to you... but can we top it with our own homemade sandwich? 

Recipe: https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/mcdonald-s-filet-o-fish-but-b...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, this is another one of those things yet again you've bullied me into doing something that i really don't want to eat or make but that's not going to stop us from making the best version that's ever [Music] [Applause] [Music] existed [Music] [Applause] [Music] so today we're making the mcdonald's filet-o-fish first off the name if anyone speaking normally to another human being says filet-o-fish immediately eject that person from the building if you don't know what this is it's basically a sandwich with two buns a piece of cheese for some reason fried fish tartar sauce sandwiched in between two buns now thinking about it i could see how it could be good hypothetically i honestly have actually never eaten one of these before so um with all that said let's go taste it and see if we can make it oh my god we're back at i hate when people say that mcdonald's it's obviously mick right m.c donald's mcdonald's yeah we're back at mcdonald's hello we're not there yet proudly serving our community here's a white guy okay time to order the one thing i never thought i would say hi uh can i get two filet o fish sandwiches thank you thank you so much so we've got unfortunately the bag i keep telling you guys we don't need to do the whole modern art burger bag okay imagine you're dyslexic and you look at this i'm so sorry for you lay a fish here we go i don't even know if this has hype really if everyone can see everyone's face in this room right now oh just don't look at it what do you think of this jojo oh my god i should not have done that that is it's like it bites you back when you smell it what is that this is not even a whole slice they 3d printed this bread what flag is this what's the difference you'll somebody feel this no it's part of the bread it's part of the bread mama close your eyes oh that cleansed the palate really well it's not crispy there's no flavor all i taste is fake bun i think i taste the fake cheese and it's just like absurdly sweet and all i gotta say is there just shouldn't be any of that in this we're not even gonna make this better we're just gonna remake the whole we're gonna like reschedule or something let's just make it you know mcdonald's buns are a tragedy also why do they smell the way that they do and my resolution to that tragedy is a beautiful hokkaido milk bread bun this dough is the exact same as my dinner roll recipe except in the form of well sandwich buns so i'm going to give a very quick overview of the dough but that full process can be found in the original video link in the description it's real simple we're going to make a quick rube paste also called the tangzhong by heating two tablespoons of flour and two tablespoons of water and four tablespoons of milk mix and heat that till thick into a paste then hydrate two and a half teaspoons of yeast in half a cup of milk and half a cup of warm water separately i've got my stand mixer where you'll whisk together your 525 grams of bread flour one tablespoon of sugar and two teaspoons of salt mix it in your stand mixer add three tablespoons of vegetable oil your tang zong paste one egg plus one egg yolk and of course your yeasty milky stuff yummy from there you're gonna cover it give it a respectful name and rise till doubled about one hour then punch the life out of it dump it onto a very lightly floured work surface now from here you're gonna divide the dough into nine even pieces that are around 80 grams per piece once that's done take each of those pieces of dough and gently shape them by gathering up their ends into the center flipping them over and rolling them in circles seam side down while maintaining constant contact with your work surface until they become doit balls repeat with the rest and place this on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper also don't forget to leave your children space to grow then just cover that with another baking sheet inverted and let that proof at room temp for 30 minutes once that's done give him a light brush of egg wash which consists of one egg beaten with one teaspoon of water then be sure to brush the entire surface of each bun okay no bald buns then toss those into a 375 degree oven for 15 to 18 minutes or until they turn into a beautiful luxurious bulbs of fluffy flavor and optionally you can give them a nice brushing of melted butter right after they're removed from the oven while still hot then just leave them to cool completely on a wire rack next up before le poisson we need a very special sauce begin with one cup of mayonnaise one tablespoon of finely sliced chives one tablespoon of finely chopped dill one shallot that's been very finely diced one tablespoon of finely chopped capers and last but not least one to two finely diced dill pickles depending on their size granted this is technically a broom walk cut which to be honest you should know but if not it's okay papa still finally hit that with the zest and juice of one large lemon season it to taste with salt and pepper and mix all that together until thoroughly combined now while this is technically an upscale tartar sauce i actually prefer to call it horsey sauce even though it's not don't ask me why because i don't actually know okay we have our components now we must take to the sea and by that i mean the seafood section of your supermarket doesn't that just sound terrible just sucks the romanticism right out of it first thing we need to pick is our fish in general most whitefish will work but i actually prefer either haddock or a nice thick cod that's cod you'll need about two pounds which should equal about one large side of fish cut that into four equally sized fillets about the size of your buns then once you have your fish season it generously with kosher salt and let it sit for about 10 minutes at room temperature or wrapped overnight in the fridge this is essentially a light cure once cured you're ready to make your batter in a large bowl add one and a quarter cup of all-purpose flour one tablespoon of garlic powder 2 teaspoons of ground white pepper 2 teaspoons of cayenne powder two teaspoons of old bay optional give that some whiskey business until thoroughly combined now next you're gonna whisk in one whole egg yes it's gonna get shaggy just please stay calm stay calm then gently whisk in one 12 ounce can of beer sound like an infomercial the way i said that and look not just any beer an ale or blonde is going to be the ideal candidate here now whisk it together till thoroughly incorporated and that is your batter please try to avoid any glumpy clumpy okay i want now fill up a pot with at least two and a half inches of vegetable oil and make sure it doesn't go more than three quarters of the way up the pot you use it's dangerous heat that over medium heat till it reaches 365 degrees fahrenheit and you're ready to fry now your fry station should look like this get a small bowl of about one cup of flour your batter and of course your fry oil and a landing zone for your fish now take a piece of fish toss it into the flour to coat and when i say coat i mean every little crevice shake off the excess flour then dunk your fish into the batter coat the whole darn thing and gently but quickly drop it into the oil i wouldn't recommend frying more than three pieces of fish at a time here now fry your fishy little men for three to five minutes or until a gorgeous golden brown quippy fish man emerges pull that out using a spider and drain on a wire rack then simply repeat with the rest of your fish for a very beautiful time now we have our components let's assemble this first grab your buns slice them in half twist them in a pan with some butter until beautifully nearly sensual toasty toasty then hit your bottom bun with one to two slices of cheese this is a sharp cheddar i lightly melted mine with a kitchen torch then carefully lower on your quiffy boy hit it with a fatty dollop of your sauce look i like a lot of sauce alright there's nothing wrong with that put it to your heart's desire and finally grab your top bun and crown your king and my goodness look at this cute little fish sandwich my buns are glistening fish looking crunchy sauce looking drippy let's see who the winner is here okay i don't even know why we're doing this we won we won it held together too a beautiful beer battered fish [Music] i i don't know what to say it's good not bad like the other one the fish is perfectly cooked it tastes fresh it's not fishy it's oceanic as it should be you got the acidity from this beautiful tartar sauce and you've got all those nice herbs and the onion and of course the fish that lacy crispy beer battery spiced crunch i mean what more could you possibly want we can't have a bus better even though we pretty much won we're to taste test this anyway beginning now today we have jojo he's a new man well no he's the same man he's just a new hire yay everybody club for jojo's super exciting oh my god stickers jumping don't drop the rig i just spot so uh fun fact jojo does not like mayonnaise i don't know why he wanted to be on this one so god bless can i give her give her a rip he's like that's numero uno my little baby [Music] describe your experience right now the fish was absolutely amazing the breading was off absolutely amazing that's after sitting for 45 minutes this breading is like it wants to fall off so bad that was horrible yeah i don't want that in my mind i feel like most people don't want this you know there is one amazing trait to this though is that you can throw this and it won't it won't fall apart what did i say what did i say okay only because it hit that pole though it doesn't really long story short we are the winners but better episode you want to know what else is full of crunchy fish man dreams sandwiched between my voluptuous buns b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our fish i mean i think we kind of knew that this was going to go over well but what i did figure out is fish sandwiches are something that need to be more in the forefront of things they're so so good fried fish two buns fried fish tacos i want to see more of that in the world there's a lot of different ways you can make this too you could mix and match the different sauces you could do different kinds of cheese like this is kind of a modular sandwich if you will you could even change the breading but i would recommend sticking to the beer batter because it's very good now with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you

here's yours you have some foil put it on the foil wait take take the pepper on the foil all right and then wrap it in the foil all right place that to the side that's gonna steam here's me wrapping it now got some mayo here so in the in that bowl you're gonna add about half a cup of mayo roughly what does half a cup look like bro i think it's gonna look like this you're gonna have to figure it out i think this is more like a cup i don't know we have some mustard okay this is dijon mustard a little bit of spice okay so of your dijon it smells nice you're gonna add about a tablespoon and a half to two tablespoons into your mayonnaise cool wait a tablespoon and a half or half a tablespoon a tablespoon and a half yup get your chives to slice your chives as thinly as possible nice and thin we don't want them chunky we want them thin sounds like she's going really fast how are you how are you matching my speed right now told you i'm a pro do they look good yeah they look great kind of annoyed with the speed put the chives in your mayo chives in i don't know what's going on over there um we're really trying it right right so the chives are in it you get a little bit of pepper a little bit of black pepper crack that in there nice and coarse i like it course oh and one more thing get your uh garlic head and we're just gonna separate out two cloves of garlic one and two how you doing over there bud got your garlic yeah we're doing great excellent so just give those a light tap that's how i like to loosen the skins there's a lot of ways you can do it but a tap is gonna get those skins to pop right off cool one garlic clove peeled and then now the next garlic clove peeled now get your mayo which now has the mustard the chives the pepper and finally get that microplane of yours wait what am i doing with the garlic you're peeling it after you've peeled it you're then going to grate it using that microplane into your mustard mayo how you doing over there i'm doing great so once that's grated get your spoon and some salt to taste you want this to be nice and punchy so you know don't be shy get your lemon you're going so fast i need you to take a deep breath vikram tell me if she looks over here somebody get no vikram don't somebody get a tickle gun i'm gonna tickle you okay so i was gonna say a taste this does not look right i just need a minute we don't do that around here so take your lemon wait i didn't even put the salt in there slice off a cheek make sure to salt it you want to make sure that you can add salt in a second okay slice off two cheeks of the lemon is that where i cut yep squeeze those cheeks into your uh your mayo so stir that stir that all together all right and then that's it it's a very very easy mayo it's thick it's viscous all right this is what it looks like one one of those chunks get your onion we're not gonna dice this or anything we're just gonna slice it in a nice little round so turn it on inside are you cutting it already yeah i know how to cut an onion if you cut it too early you're gonna screw yourself bud okay so turn it on its side you've got your uh your root here at the top just cut the top off like that okay and we're gonna cut this into like little rings oh shoot i'm glad i didn't start and we only need two of those we don't need a bunch of them this is enough to serve like i just cut the f out of my finger wait really are you okay look it's not that mad oh hear the at me dude i thought you cut your finger off that's not funny okay dude that sounded like her finger went off because that knife i just sharpened you did not sharpen this knife it's so dull the video does not lie so get your foil of pepper you got that now the skin's charred but if you literally just rub your finger down notice how the skin comes right off yeah so then take it so so do that but then use your paper towel to sort of like wipe it off wipe off all that charred bits we're cleaning them isn't that so pretty now we're gonna we need to take the seeds out so cut the top of the pepper off just just a little bit right i can see those seeds in there and then cut down the length of the pepper sort of opening it up it's like surgery and then cut around the inside of that pepper to sort of open it up spread it out into one long piece the top and bottom you don't need that's trash so instead we're left with this sort of this guy we got our long piece of pepper flesh and then we're literally just going to slice that into nice little batons ribbons if you will and if you slice them properly they should look a little bit like this you know you got little little joints little batons little flappy men okay so put those in a bowl once you've sliced them all are they in a bowl no all right got my lemon got my olive oil and i've got my salt now from there i'm gonna add a little bit of salt that's kosher salt i'm gonna take just one of those cheeks of the lemon not the whole lemon just a little cheek of it okay that's going to go in and then a nice generous sort of drizzle of olive oil and then just toss those together get a nice and dressed let those sit to the side marinate okay so get two of your onion slices really you only need one so you can just pick your favorite one and take off the skin layer but leave the rest all together so you're just taking off one layer the outer layer okay it should look like this i gotta use the stove you have a stovetop so you're good over there turn that on to medium high you're gonna add a little bit of oil to the pan coat the pan nicely all right just enough to coat the bottom about two tablespoons is it getting nice and hot i don't know maybe we're just gonna wait let it get ripping hot you have your onions ready almost okay your fingers look gross from the pepper well no because i wiped them off oh oh no smoking yeah cool so it's hot so add your onion oil doesn't steam hey that's and it gets a good sound mine's still uh my pan is taking its time what do i do with it oh no it's popping all right my oil's hot i'm gonna add my onions this one's actually not hot enough i don't know what's wrong with my stove right now like this has been heating for how long okay now we're gonna let that sear for about two to three minutes untouched i flip it back over tj are you helping no no helping i'll let you know when i flip mine i already put mine is there good color yeah is it brown yeah okay cool well season it with salt then i'll wait for mine to cook i don't know what i'm doing actually now i'm seasoning it with salt to taste don't have a feet does the green mean it's raw huh is the green mints raw what are you saying does the green mean that it's raw green uh it could just be really fresher yeah i mean i suppose we're brew laying onions we're brew laying onions i don't know what's going on if you think it's done go ahead and pull it ow and just salt that we have our onions all right they're not completely raw they're not like completely cooked they're you know a little bitey and there's some caramelization on the outside that that's how i want them now your pan you can set to the side okay so we got our lettuce take it out of its bag put it on the cutting board dude this is like in a that's okay and then you're gonna take your knife and cut it off cut the entire piece of lettuce off you have your steak all right get some paper towel just one one sheet okay and just dab your steak off so it's nice and dry all right kate no uh no wet you have it on your board right yeah okay so start heating your pan over medium-high heat to your pan you're then going to add two and a half to three tablespoons of oil just enough to coat the bottom of the pan nice and good uh get your salt and pepper ready because you're gonna season your steak okay i got my steak right here always season your steak right before it goes in the pan never like let it sit with salt again what did i say about water right god damn it what if i already saw salt okay so season it with salt generously kosher salt that's my favorite choice uh especially for a steak all right so we've got salt on that end pretty generously some pepper whoa pretty generous rub that in other side more salt nice and generous don't be shy all right you want a lot of salt on a steak cake now we got our salt and pepper it's all rubbed in the sides nice and gathered up all right steaks looking beautiful hands looking nice and hot now we're gonna add our steak to the pan and sear it for about two to three minutes all right so our pan's nice and hot steak goes in okay don't look please i'm not looking all right so steak is searing about two to three minutes ah this is my favorite part about cooking a steak is this [Music] all right so put your butter in the pan tilt the pan face with butter you're basting it and you're just going to do that until it's medium rare so take your steak out put it on your cutting board and let it rest that's how i get tongs yep okay that's the first steak i've ever made wow okay your stick should be nice and medium rare so let that rest don't touch it don't cut it just let it sit and do its thing stop looking over here get over there i miss you pan on the stove once more one last time all right place it over medium heat all right and to that you're gonna add two of those pieces of butter i gave you two or three get your bun and then just cut that in half as evenly as you can you know what i mean by in half right hot dog or hamburger ham hamburger once your butter's melted in bouboulin you know place your buns directly in that pan fun fact no wait i worked at a fast food restaurant and i was the cook they only put me on bread because that's the only thing i knew how to do so then this should be your best product then right yeah okay ones are toasted look at that look at that toast it's beautiful oh they're really burnt did not do well they're really burnt it's fine we have our steak now go ahead and cut that rib cap section off that's the sort of outer layer you'll you'll notice two really three pieces there's that tail on the far right if it's facing you or far left all right cut the tail off all right and then we've got that rib oh surrounds the steak cool now you can slice this a number of ways i'm just gonna slice that guy against the grain nice and sort of i would say like a half inch thick all the way down the whole thing cool wait sliced i cut it off i cut off the tail so now what do i do we're going to just slice that center piece just into nice strips about about a half inch thick wait strips yeah like slices i thought this was supposed to be a hamburger so i've sliced these into strips these are a bit long so i'm actually going to cut i'm going to remove two of these and then just cut the rest in half real quick look at this beautiful medium rare we got going on here look at that so place that to the side and we're ready to assemble our sandos cool so clean off your knife clean off your board assembling the sandwich is very easy okay you're gonna get your mayo now put your bottom bun down first cut side up all right and then now we're gonna get our mayo sauce our mustard mayo that we made earlier put a couple nice spoonfuls on there spread it around so it's sort of coating the uh the bottom bun nicely and evenly look at that that's a gorgeous color is it not don't you just want to kiss that or something so from here we're gonna add our lettuce you know break off some pieces of lettuce line your whole bottom bun with little pieces of lettuce make it look beautiful you know next get your peppers all right layer on as much as you like as much or as little as you want peppers on the bottom about yes so next step we're going to put the steak on make it look just absolutely am i supposed to be touching with my bare hands yeah that's fine all right we got our we got our our beef our beefus is it okay if it's super thick yes that's what you want last but not least all right is your onions those nice beautifully caramelized onions not caramelized but charred don't put all of them just put as little or as many as you like you don't need a ton that i feel pretty good about that amount right there you're gonna add one more good dollop of sauce on top of all that all right spread it let it kind of just fall naturally all over the meat it's gonna look absolutely lovely right you do it right it's gonna look beautiful all right and then a little tiny bit more on your top bun i like a lot of sauce all right guys everybody some people make fun of me about it i like it now finally your top bun this is the moment of truth you're gonna crown your king all right top bun goes straight down onto your sandwich to then complete your beautiful steak sandwich i mean look at this it's stunning visually in every way this is my steak sandwich this is my steak sandwich the moment of truth how do you think you did how do you feel it's a sandwich do you feel good about it yes let's unveil it i'm ready reveal look at that that looks great yeah it looks so good look at that it's like they're friends let's do it i think you did a very good job yes it's tasting time now got my sandwich we got your sandwich we're going to rotate oh no and taste each other's sandwiches so grab a grab a piece you're going to have to hold it together they want to fall apart naturally so cheers make them kiss you this is a pretty god dang solid really yeah this is very good oh no that was really good so what are your thoughts when you want to switch see the difference next one so the first thing i noticed with mine it's much messier mine is not as messy not as messy the true immediate thoughts i like the sauce on yours a lot better adds a flavor to it i think mine's a little bit dry your sauce is dry your steak is cooked nicely it's a perfect medium rare that's true i'm not even not even joking seasoned well the only thing i would say is the bun was toasted too quickly so the bun is ice cold only a little bit of toast but honestly that's a good sandwich and i would eat that and pay for that so we have two different sandwiches mine hers this was never really a versus more so how well can she keep up with only verbal instructions and i think he did very good i really did so this was this is a win-win this was a double w what i learned today in boating school is that i am screwed if me and josh break up and i have to cook my own meals all right i'm happy with these results you should be proud so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time thank you for coming [Music] bye [Music] you

But... is there a best of all-time version? Turns out... there are multiple versions.  

Recipe: https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/per...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, so apparently fettuccine alfredo isn't really a thing in italy what what what yes quite possibly let me explain are people thinking right now like quite possibly [Music] okay so today we're making fettuccine alfredo three different ways what we believe to be the original version of fettuccine alfredo which is fettuccine we're making the americanized version which many of you probably know and probably are here for obviously the best way that we can make it and then the third it's gonna be i guess i don't know i felt like i was bullied into making a healthy version because everyone's like something healthy anyway with all it said let's make this shall we okay red alert listen up buddy fettuccine alfredo isn't really a thing in italy oh whoopsy doodly it's an american thing so before we even go there i'd like to show you where i believe it actually came from which is an italian classic fettuccine alburro it's one of the easiest pastas of all time to begin you're going to need 14 ounces or 400 grams of dried fetuccine i'm putting a lot of flare i'll calm down a little bit place it in a pot of boiling water that's been seasoned very generously with salt i mean like as salty as the ocean all right buddy now let that cook according to the package's instructions or until al dente remember to taste your pasta as it cooks now while that's cooking get a large bowl that can easily fit your pasta and add half a cup or 115 grams of unsalted butter that has been softened and as soon as your pasta is done pull out and reserve about three quarters of a cup or 175 milliliters of the pasta water then drain your pasta and immediately add your hot pasta to your butter bowl start tossing that with the butter pretty vigorously once the butter is almost fully melted add 2 cups or 250 grams of fresh grated parmigiano reggiano begin tossing vigorously using your pasta water as needed to melt the cheese and thin the sauce to a consistency you like ideally you want to turn into a creamy white sauce that then coats each noodle nicely it should cling with a beautiful emulsion you should have something of a glass to it then just season that the taste with salt and pepper and serve in a bowl top with additional parmigiano and black pepper to taste now let's see how we're looking with this one fettuccine alfredo the italians they don't like it okay it's an americanized thing this is technically what alfredo was derived from fettuccine alburo okay that is this okay [Music] oh my lord something about doing it the right way really hits different at the end of the day this is the right way to do a proper fettuccine alfredo not with cream but the only problem is this requires technique if you can get that down then you'll have your best version ever but we're still going to do two more after this we're going to be doing an americanized version i'm sorry italians got to be done all right and then what dare i say healthy version right on to the next the illegal but oh so tasty fettuccine alfredo all right again boyle 14 ounces or 400 grams of dried fettuccine as directed on le package that's not a real french word i don't think separately get a large pan and add one and a quarter cup or 300 milliliters of heavy whipping cream and half a cup or 115 grams of unsalted butter turn the heat to medium and begin constantly stirring the pan until all the butter is melted increase your heat slightly above medium and bring to a gentle simmer now let that simmer stirring occasionally for three to four minutes or until it starts to lightly thicken once that's done cut off the heat and add two cups or 250 grams of parmigiano reggiano see how it's about to get all fancy again with those two teaspoons are four grams of finely chopped thyme and five cloves of garlic that have been very finely chopped vigorously stir that together until thoroughly combined and emulsified then season the mixture to taste with salt and pepper and look this process is real simple once your pasta is done reserve a half cup or 120 milliliters of pasta water drain your pasta then immediately add your hot pasta to the alfredo sauce and toss using your pasta water as needed to emulsify the sauce further you'll likely use about half of your reserved pasta water so a quarter cup or potentially more depending on how much you reduce the sauce then to get a nice little shape grab a carving fork and a ladle twirl it up real nice into a beautiful little man place it in a plate or a shallow bowl and immediately top with a nice fresh grating of parmigiano-reggiano and a crack of the black peppercorn now let's see if there's a difference between these two challengers this is the version that many americans know this is the alfredo now the italians that are watching this right now probably their immediate thought is oh what the heck is this ah what do you mean what could you do you're right this is the non-traditional version but i gotta do it for all the people i see him turned away look at me of course you can tell it's not traditional obviously can't just say that this doesn't taste good this is gummy very gemy you want that more americanized flavor that you might be used to if you go to some crappy italian place this is going to be the best version of that which is technically lesser than the italian virgin but still yummy now we've done our two versions the next one we're gonna test and see if a healthy version i don't really believe in the whole healthy non-healthy thing it's lower calorie all right we go okay last but not least we have a healthy-ish herb fettuccine alfredo now this one is completely different and requires a little trickery first you'll need a head of cauliflower remove the stems and acquire yourself about two and a half cups of cauliflower florets that'll end up being about half of a medium head pop those floors into a medium sized sauce pot add in one cup or 240 milliliters of milk this could be whole milk which is my ideal choice or even a nut milk if you want yes nut milk haha very funny followed by one tablespoon or 14 grams of unsalted butter bring that up to a boil over medium heat then reduce the heat to medium low and let it simmer covered with a lid or in this case foil because i don't know where any of my freaking lids are for 12 to 15 minutes or until all the cauliflower is completely mushy remove from the heat pour all the contents into a blender along with three cloves of garlic two teaspoons of finely chopped fresh thyme half a cup or 62 grams of grated parmigiano-reggiano season its taste with salt and pepper and blend on high speed until it's as smooth as an egg wait what some eggs aren't really that smooth anyway right from there you know the drill boil your fettuccine this time you don't need as much pasta butter if any at all pop your pasta into a bowl that's been filled with some of your caulifredo sauce and toss until thoroughly coated and served with more parmigiano on top adjust salt and pepper levels and let's see if this healthy little pants man can even compare to the real deal stuff my guess is probably not okay oh my it's almost upset that it's the healthy one this one's a little coagulated now that it's sad this tastes good but it is no alfredo it does lack that intense richness that crunchy umami cheesy easy flavor but i bet you could make this even better if you added some nutritional yeast or whatever keep the calories low without having to add more cheese that's a good idea which is which i'll figure it out you're going to know which one maybe you know both are just like good to me i don't care can we get an italian dessert are you telling me i'm italian that's fettuccine how did you not tell the difference that's got the natural fettuccine flavor that's way better that's fettuccine that's a good thing i'm not going to be here oh my god this tastes exactly the same it doesn't but if you're washing your your calories or whatever this is a good alternative you're trying to get shredded like me and noor you want to know what else is full of creamy nudes calling your name in the darkness b-roll [Music] our guys and that is it so we made our fettuccine alfredo or well alburo or the cauliflower cola fredo the point is we made it three different ways and each version i think was special in its own way the italians they get very upset about the heavy cream version heavy cream is uh something that they don't tread lightly with and i understand why because it's kind of cheating it's not a true emulsified sauce because you're using cream to bind it all and yada yada i get it but it's still kind of jummy i'm not gonna lie but at the end of the day the alburo version is the best i think it's the most fully flavored and it's also the most simple it's simple beautiful rich and decadent all in one what more do you want in a little pasta dish you know creamy yum yum the healthy one you know it tasted healthy but for the most part it was actually pretty good on its own now what i classified to be similar to the other two not really but it does satisfy that desire a little bit look it's up to you if you're on a diet or not maybe just maybe just make it all the way okay anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you [Music] hmm
190,190,The 2 Dollar Sandwich | But Cheaper,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gjhOPHoRJBs/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLD0QPC7J4LWK3uSJjvL50TnexpabA,gjhOPHoRJBs,"8 minutes, 1 second","A great sandwich is usually overpriced. But you can make this homemade sandwich for a total of 2 dollars PER SERVING. That means your 12 dollar sandwich is going right out the window.  

Recipe:...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, wait a minute are we not going to talk about how sandwiches are kind of like big boy overpriced the average sandwich costs this right here but i think we can take that price to this per sandwich that is but cheaper [Music] when i break down the sandwich i'm looking at all these different elements right we all know bread is cheap everybody knows that but let's talk about the meat so take turkey for example right you'll get sliced turkey and you're paying a per pound price which is astronomically higher than it should be you're basically paying for the whole breast so that's what we need to have as our plan of attack the bread is cheap you can make it cheaper by making it yourself and all the other elements blah blah blah blah we'll work our magic long story short let's make this shall we oh roy so the first thing we're going to break down is the most expensive part why buy expensive lunch meat when you could just well make it first thing you'll need is some sort of a large container that can easily hold one gallon of water pour in you guessed it one gallon of cold water to that water you're going to start whisking and adding three quarters of a cup or 216 grams of kosher salt half a cup 115 grams of brown sugar whisk all that until completely dissolved then optionally you can add aromatics like one tablespoon or nine grams of uncrushed black peppercorns two crumbled bay leaves and three sprigs of fresh thyme that have also been lightly crushed optional but you know flavor time so that's your brine give it a sniff to find out that it really doesn't smell like anything right now next up you're gonna need one large skin on turkey breast ideally mine was a little misshapen and i wanted to look real nice for the b-roll so i actually cut it down a little bit but you don't have to do that at all gently submerge your bird into the brine and make sure it stays under the water or papa no geese cover it and let it brine in the fridge overnight now once your big breasted bird has rested pull it out of the brine and pat it completely dry with paper towels from there you'll place it on a wire rack set over a baking sheet that has been lined with foil unless you want burn stuff on the bottom that's really hard to clean off whatever it's up to you optionally you can give it a light coating with vegetable oil and add additional seasoning if you desire but that's not entirely necessary at all a light sprinkle of salt would do just fine now take the bird pop it into the oven set to 400 degrees fahrenheit for about 30 minutes or until it becomes a nice golden brown color and the interior reaches 163 degrees fahrenheit this thing is so big that the temperature will definitively coast to 165. now just let it rest until it reaches room temperature then wrap it in plastic wrap nice and tight and set it in the fridge until completely cold at least three hours but ideally overnight i know it's a two day process but look now you have a massive amount of turkey lunch meat now all you need to do is slice it up obviously you could just use a sharp knife and slice it as thin as you want and this is but cheaper so i'm going to recommend that option but i wanted to try this meat slicer that i got and i gotta say it kind of sucks but it got the job done so whatever but hold on a second let's look at this gorgeous slice of turkey unbelievably moist beautiful and ready to be scrunched between two slices of bread now next up is our sando sauce it's real simple get a medium sized bowl and add one-third of a cup or 80 grams of mayonnaise a quarter cup or 48 grams of dijon or yellow mustard a quarter cup or 20 grams of finely chopped parsley and two cloves of garlic that have been grated season that a taste with fresh ground black pepper and kosher salt mix all that together until thoroughly combined and that is your sandwich lube yes it's basically sandwich lube let's be honest okay we're so close to this sandwich can't you just smell it sort of kind of probably not we have one last sandwich component i was thinking about adding sliced tomato but that's lame so let's do something a little more metal brother let's sear these now get a large skillet and heat it with just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom about three tablespoons or 45 grams heat that over medium high heat until shimmering and hot hot potat then carefully add in one container about half a pound of grape tomatoes now let those sear blister and char they're gonna spit quite a bit as they sear because of all the bursting juice so please be careful after about three minutes check them and they should have softened quite a bit and gotten some good char if not leave them in until they do then immediately remove place to the side and season the taste with salt and fresh cracked black pepper okay i actually want to know one more thing let's talk about sliced onion on a sandwich first off thinly sliced onions are superior and when i say thin i mean as thin as you can get nearly shaved more importantly i have a secret for you after you've sliced your onions place them in a bowl and top that bowl with a wire rack and run your tap so it fills up with water and overflows into your sink then just keep running that water and let it rinse for about 30 seconds and this is gonna help wash away a lot of the abrasive qualities of an onion it keeps the onion mild enough to eat a lot of but just a little bit of spice while maintaining that nice fragrant sweet onion yay it's sandwich assembly time now we need some sort of bread this is up to you obviously homemade bread is ultra cheap but so is a lot of store-bought bread choose whatever you want i'm not gonna judge you here i'm using a nice fresh baked sourdough loaf you'll need about eight slices for four servings see it's a basic mathematical equation optionally you can toast your bread in a toaster or in a pan with butter until beautifully toasty golden brown then lay down your bread and on both halves spread on a generous amount of your mustard mayo next up some lettuce you can use iceberg or butter followed by your seared tomatoes your thinly sliced red onions juicy turkey breast and optionally one to two slices of swiss cheese unless you get farty with cheese i don't know and finally crown your king i mean look at this magnificent sandwich grand total price of this per sandwich that's better than just about any sandwich shop you're gonna go to now let's slice this in half and check out the cross section oh wow yes okay let's just let's taste test this okay so we have our completed sandwich and i gotta say this sandwich looks waited for this we met at top vikram and tj's favorite sandwich just because of how simple this is because we've done much more complicated sandwiches and this sandwich for the this price right here per sandwich is 175 i don't really want to say anything because it's really yummy my entire cruise just standing here just watching me get in here you have a little taste no the turkey breast feels like you're drinking water it's just like really refreshing it's on par with the focaccia sandwich if anybody has eaten that or seen it this is on par for the price the sandwich especially for the price you would go to a jimmy john's and pay like twelve dollars for this and you get one sandwich and it's done we still have a load of turkey breast to slice so this is a butt better and a butt cheaper the overarching word that i think we're all looking for for this sandwich is delicious just as good as any other sandwich and and i repeat moist you want to know what else is full of juicy breast sandwiches and sandwich lube [Music] b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our beautiful perfect sandwich i think if you sell this at any menu anywhere at any restaurant i mean i would pay 16 for it i would do that would you vikram yes he's like no way you can have a delicious sandwich if you just break down these elements and actually make them yourself you can do it why are we paying so much money for a cold cut why all right i'm off my soapbox anyway if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time people finally stopped complaining about the cabinet opening and closing with this they finally realized oh it's a different

191,191,The Greatest Caesar Salad of All Time (2 Ways),https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a4Z2x0sPq3A/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAsyXpPv8TQXyBLHotJdgiqf7ajRg,a4Z2x0sPq3A,"10 minutes, 9 seconds","Most Caesar salads are trash. Let's just be honest. Today we're gonna do it homemade, the right way, and it's going to be amazing. 

Garlic Bread Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkV_fU5GoXM...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, caesar salad has to be one of the most common salads in the world and yet almost every single freaking time it's messed up so we're gonna fix that and then at the end i have a little surprise for you [Music] okay so today we're talking about the caesar salad look when i say that it's messed up commonly what i'm talking about is not just the leaves and the croutons and that stuff i mean granted the crappy pre-made croutons that a lot of restaurants use make me want to smash my head into a wall it's just not right but more importantly the dressing the freaking dressing it's extremely easy you can definitely do it and then once we've made it we're going to make a nice little mystery sandwich anyway with all that said let's make this shall we listen caesar salad is an art form it's simple but it has a few rules if you want it to be utter perfection this is your arsenal against shitty tasting dressing there's nothing worse and none of these ingredients are to change at any point in time and neither should this process if you do papa no like and pop up maybe also no keys alright so first thing we're gonna make the entire backbone of this recipe the dressing you're gonna need six fatty cloves of garlic smash them all with the flat side of your knife like nicely sprinkle them generously with kosher salt the salt helps break down the garlic and pull out its liquid now listen carefully begin a rolling chop like this and just keep chopping and gathering chopping and gathering smearing your knife on occasion to break its cell walls even further and you're going to continue this process for about three to five minutes or until you get a relatively fine paste that holds together when smearing like this now you're gonna get yourself three anchovy fillets that were packed in olive oil finally chop those as well until they're as fine as possible you could probably go find her but you want a paste then chop both your garlic paste and your anchovy paste together until it's ultra fine and creates a nice but kind of ugly looking paste trust me this is the most important thing add your garlic anchovy paste to medium sized bowl and to that you're going to add two large egg yolks the juice of one and a half large lemons and one heaping tablespoon or 18 grams of dijon mustard season that generously with kosher salt whisk all that together until thoroughly combined and then while constantly whisking slowly begin adding one and a quarter cup or 300 milliliters of vegetable oil look it's just like a mayo literally one drop at a time at first until it starts to get a little creamy and emulsified then increase to a nice even but slow stream keep on whisking and adding your oil and i repeat do not stop whisking you should notice that the dressing is getting thicker and creamier as you go and you're gonna add all of this oil now if it's not thick enough by the time you've added all of it you can add another quarter cup of oil then once it's done you're gonna add three quarters of a cup or 70 grams of finely grated parmigiano-reggiano whisk that in oh and don't forget to drop your whisk too really helps develop the full flavor okay so we have our lovely dressing but now we need to talk croutons if you go to the store papa you don't even want to know what papa will do if you buy pre-made croutons get yourself a nice lip of ciabatta cut that through the middle into two pieces and then in half lengthwise like a sandwich now cut each half into one inch wide batons now at this point you of course can brush these with a little bit of olive oil but i actually used my garlic bread recipe which the link for that will be in the description spread a generous amount of your garlic bread butter over each piece then place those on a baking sheet lined with foil and toss it into an oven set to 400 degrees fahrenheit for 10 minutes or until golden brown and beautiful look i don't want them completely dry like little explosive crunchies i want a little bit of moist chew in the middle yes moist now using a sharp knife cut along your batons to get individual little crouton failures and those are well your croutons garlic bread croutons that is all right we have our two most important pieces now for the greenery i like to use boston or bib lettuce and romaine romaine provides the refreshing crunch while the boston or bib brings some tenderness and light sweetness it's a good thing now break off all the leaves and toss those two heads together nicely in a large bowl and then to plate up add your leaves which i hope you wash properly to a salad bowl or plate then arrange on your croutons and if you want to have a fancy little table service moment drizzle on your dressing all of your salad to your liking now while that's great for b-roll let me show you how to properly dress a salad it's very simple get your greens in a bowl immediately season your leaves to taste with salt this is a crucial salad dressing secret for all salads then add your desired amount of dressing ideally around the edges of the bowl rather than directly on the greens then using your hands or tongs vigorously but gently toss the salad haha toss a salad to coat each and every leaf give it a small taste and if it needs any more salt or acid you can adjust those levels from there and that's a properly dressed salad you understand now we have our finished beautiful salad i think it's time that we taste a test i got two forks and i don't know why but i'm gonna catch both of them so anyway this is an original ultra traditional caesar salad oh yeah a little crouton first off make your own croutons it's always gonna come out on top second off the dressing perfection finito this is how you make an appropriate caesar dressing none of that weird stuff it's all done by hand you break up the allicin in the garlic and make it real tasty and gently i'm not gonna be long-winded about it this is the only way you should ever make a caesar dressing for the rest of your life and it will change your salad game permanently but if there's one other thing i want to change permanently it's the sandwich game which we're going to do right now yeah okay i got another thing for you maybe you don't want a salad maybe you want a big beefy caesar sandwich that makes angels cry tears of joy first we need one sweet onion that's not why they're crying by the way they're crying because it's good not because of the onion slice that into half inch slices leaving it in a single round remove the peel but don't separate it into rings now hit a medium skillet over medium-high add about 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil or enough to coat the bottom of the pan then once ripping hot add in your onion sear on that side for about three minutes you can use a press like the chef press to keep them flat until deeply brew laid then give them a flip it's okay if they fall a little bit apart sometimes that happens season the taste of salt and repeat on the other side and look if you want to get a little fancy with the brulee onions obviously you can leave them like this and that's just fine but you know for some reason i don't know why i decided to get some bourbon pour a splash in there and ignite it because it looks cool and it's jummy you know you get a little bit of a onion bourbon syrup that coats it and turns it from onion to onion once the other side is done you have your beautiful bruleed onions now for the steak we've got a lovely texas wagyu ribeye shout out to the homies from rigalis for sending this guy my way papa geese simply heat up a medium largest skillet over medium-high heat add just enough vegetable oil to cover the surface of the pan now while that's heating pat your steak completely dry with paper towels season it very generously with salt and black pepper pressing in that seasoning nicely of course both sides always duh and once that pan is hot add in your steak and press to adhere sear that for about two to three minutes or until deeply browned give her a little flip and optionally toss in a small bunch of thyme a couple tablespoons of unsalted butter and baste constantly with butter until it reaches a beautiful medium rare then immediately pull your steak out of the pan let it rest on a cutting board for about five minutes okay we're almost there but before we assemble let's get the rest of our mise en place get two slices of nice quality bread like this sourdough toasted butter in a pan you know like grilled cheese style until it's nice and toasty slice one large tomato a quarter of an inch thick and more importantly salt your tomatoes any time you make a sandwich i've said this before i'll say it again now once your steak is rested it's time to slice separate the rib cap from the eye because it's a rib eye see how those names start to make a little sense then just slice your stick as thick or as thin as you want i like it a little bit on the thinner side but not too thin you know i don't want it like paper thin now to assemble get your bread add some dressing on both sides spread it around nicely then lay down your lovely tomatoes on the bottom slice then some of those same salad greens that have been seasoned and dressed with more caesar dressing your beautiful sliced steak more dressed lettuce and of course your brew laid sweet onions as much or as little as you like and finally crown your king with the beautifully toasted and dressed other half my mouth is watering right now just looking at this slice it in half then enjoy a cross section nearly unfit for mere mortals to gaze upon and of course hop on our train with a one-way ticket to flavortown this that's a freaking sandwich dude i love sandwiches with caesar dressing imagine the perfect sandwich whatever that is to you you're eating you're enjoying it feels good maybe the nips go dunk doing but something in there is elevating it what is that it's so jummy what could it possibly oh yeah it's caesar dressing proper caesar dressing and a little bit of caesar salad on there too the toast is the crunchy crouton it's basically a salad in the form of a sandwich the point is whatever format salad you want to enjoy whether it's in a nice little bowl with your little dressing croutons and cheese or a big bad sandwich it's all up to you all right there's nothing that i'm trying to force you to do except well make the dressing properly but you know what i don't care it's my dressing and that's how i make it and if you don't then papa no keys you want to know what else is full of creamy salty goodness and oozes meat juices into your mouth [Music] b-roll [Music] alright guys and that is it so we made our caesar salad it came out perfectly it was splendid the little garlic bread croutons you don't even have to go that hard you could just toss in a little oil and toast them that's fine delicious either way but more importantly that caesar dressing when you get that right that perfect balance of saltiness acidity umami it's just it feels so good so righteous and you want to put it on everything which is exactly why i made the fancy steak salad with a little bit of caesar salad in it wait did i say steak salad steak sandwich the sandwich did i say salad the point is i hope this was helpful for you because i want to see more proper caesar salads and i promise when you taste this it will change your life in the perspective of salad

KitchenAid Stand Mixer: https://shop-links.co/1736668514694012173...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, look we've out pizza the hut before and they didn't like that so we're gonna do it again [Music] okay so we're back added us versus pizza hut look the last time we did this they got they may not have anticipated that they didn't like it they commented that comment by the way has circulated the internet many many times it's gonna round it around why not revisit this and do their cheesy stuffed crust let me preface this with something very important italians if you're watching please look away because this this is not an accurate representation of what i think is good pizza all right we're just butt bettering a pizza that should have never existed so with all that said let's make this shall we okay pizza hut we gotta give them a call because it's a to-go order what's the slogan oh no one on pizza is a hud huh i've already done that i'm doing it again but this time not only i'm gonna out pizza the hut you wanna stuff them okay here we go here's one that's only seven minutes away wow look at that the images on here on their reviews are not great i was looking pretty rough but what what's going on here oh no they have two and a half stars uh if this directs me to their website i'm gonna lose my mind thank you for calling my name i'm touching between you and the driver okay cool i don't really want to be touched by the driver anyway so it's fine can i get for you today uh can i do two medium pepperoni pizzas with the stuffed crust okay would you like that extra cheese for additional charge uh no thank you okay it's already was it just me or was that kind of a weird ordering experience the lowest energy slowest ordering hey sarah would you like to have a pizza yes that's why that's why i called i guess now we wait okay so our pizza delivery driver actually found us this time yay good job pizza hut give the box the center looks like a good looking pizza but the exterior looks like a steering wheel pizza's usually good regardless of the quality no cheese pull oh yeah now that's quality pizza quality with confidence let me help you okay so the pizza itself it tastes like the classic pizza hut pizza it's like the mcdonald's of pizza sauce is too sweet it doesn't taste like tomatoes the pepperoni is good i like that and the cheese is cheese is all right it's not blowing my skirt up that's for sure i am wearing a skirt by the way the real highlight here is the stuffed crust and uh this is what it looks like that's what that's what you all are hyped about it's not even stuffed anymore it all came out the front here's the problem with this this highlights what the cheese actually tastes like too much and you lost me their pizza it's pizza it's commonly good it's not terrible but it could be a million times better okay you can't have a regular pie without crust and therefore you can't have a pizza pie without dough to make that you'll start with one and a third cup or 320 milliliters of water that's around 95 fahrenheit or 35 celsius to that you're gonna add two and a half teaspoons or eight grams of instant yeast mix together and let it sit for about five minutes then in the bowl of stand mixer add three and a half cups or 500 grams of all-purpose flour one and a half teaspoons or six grams of sea salt and one tablespoon or 14 grams of granulated sugar whisk that together till thoroughly combined slap that bad boy on your spinning fancy man machine with the dough hook attachment on begin mixing on low speed and add two and a half tablespoons or 35 grams of extra virgin olive oil let that distribute for a couple of seconds then add all of your yeasty boy mixture let that mix scraping the sides every so often to make sure the flour is getting picked up obviously let that mix for two to three minutes or until you get a nice homogenized dough dump it out onto a lightly floured work surface and look the dough's gonna be a little sticky that's okay you can always add a touch more flour and knead that for about two to three minutes or until very smooth then just grease a large bowl lightly shape your dough into a ball plop it in your bowl cover it with lightly greased plastic wrap and of course give it a respectful and lovable name and rise at room temperature for one hour or until doubled in size while that's rising add a pizza stone to your oven around the middle area and begin preheating it to its maximum temp mine is about 500 fahrenheit or 260 celsius once risen bring your son over to your lightly floured work surface love him cherish him and then punch him down from whence he can dump that onto a lightly floured work surface divide into two even pieces pre-shape into a round like you see here don't get it too taut then place it in a dough proofing box or baking sheet that's been generously dusted with flour cover with something that won't touch their tops in this case it's a lid and let it rest for 15 to 20 minutes now while that's resting let's make our sauce it's easy it's fast all right don't whine now in a medium saucepan add four ounces or 113 grams of guan chalet or bacon if you want to be little baby that's been nicely diced saute that over medium heat for about three minutes or until it's rendered most of its fat and is beginning to brown then add a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of extra virgin olive oil and once that's hot add in four thinly sliced cloves of garlic let that cook stirring occasionally until the garlic begins to get nice and toasted but not blackened that would be too far then immediately add one 14 and a half ounce can of good quality crushed tomatoes stir to incorporate then add four sprigs of fresh thyme three sprigs of fresh sage i actually tied these together to make a little bouquet gianni how was my french pretty good no okay it's for the culinary flexin because oh little baby's so cute now enjoy the scorching frame of my tomato sauce season the taste with salt and pepper and let that simmer and reduce for five to eight minutes or until lightly thickened now that's a tomato sauce snag a pizza peel and generously dust it with cornmeal or flour although cornmeal works better grab one of your rusted dough rounds place it down punch it into a nice circle now against tradition in order to stuff your crust you're actually gonna have to use a rolling pin to roll this out into a circle that's about a quarter of an inch thick you can really hear the screams of the italians as we choose this illegal move i promise italians i don't usually do it like this okay please now from there you're gonna line the edges with mozzarella that means either mozzarella sticks or a block of mozzarella that's been cut into sticks obviously bot sticks are the easiest option you'll need about seven eight sticks that are about three quarters of an inch thick per pizza yes a lot now once you've done that give the inside nearest to the mozzarella a light brushing of water then carefully wrap the edges of the dough inward and just over the mozzarella pinching each piece completely shut you must pinch it shut completely or you're gonna make papa sad once that's done you have your cheesy crusty complete it's the crusty that's what we call it from there add a light layer of tomato sauce give it a nice spread as we enjoy sprinkle on as much or as little cheese as you like it's all up to you this is a mix of one cup of shredded mozzarella and half cup shredded parmigiano reggiano optionally you can arrange some of your little pepperonis should you desire i like to slice my own because i like them thick now make sure your pizza slides around the peel real easily then pop up in your oven and quickly but carefully slide your pizza into the oven onto the pizza stone like you see me doing here it takes some practice but papa believe in you now close the oven and let it bake for six to ten minutes or until a beautiful golden brown i actually pulled mine a little bit early and we'll just pretend that it's not a little bit too light whatever now while that's baking we're gonna make a quick butter brush for the crust to do that you'll need a small saucepan melt 1 3 of a cup or 85 grams of salted butter over medium heat and as soon as it's melted cut the heat remove it from the heat and whisk in three cloves of grated garlic and one tablespoon of grated parmigiano-reggiano then as soon as your hot pizza pie comes out of the oven give the crust a generous brushing of garlic butter all the way around your pizza oh yeah papa give the crusty a little brushy now from there all you need to do is give your pizza a look of confidence give it a slice enjoy a most extraordinary cheese pull sure to make anyone smile and give it a taste test we have two pizzas and i have two things to say this is a lot bigger than mine which makes me very sad and also i kind of wanted more color this would have been much better if we had done this in the uni oven right so just keep that in mind but i'm trying to make it easy for you so we have our fruity pizza now note the underside all right we got some char we got some crisp some crisp penis and then this guy this looks like it's been to jail it's got like a chain link fence on the back end of it first off the pepperonis way better which is saying something because i do like the pizza hut peps they're not bad tastes good but i like them thick i like when they get nice and cuppy and there's a little bit of oil in there that has that they're a little crisp around the edge the bread is soft now let's test the exterior here i mean you already know it's a clear winner right you've got two different things do i think that this is like astronomically better actually no but i would say it's 30 percent better because you have the garlic bread crust that garlic butter brush there's actual depth of flavor you can taste the cheese it's not just like i mean there's not really anything in here maybe that's the problem more specifically you can taste the guanciale you can taste all that little spice there's no weird ketchup sweetness i think we've won this but we need a taste tester to finalize that okay vikram's back that's the pizza end that's the crust end i would try to get a bite of both if you can i don't know how you would do that all right um i don't know the letters but this one is about i'm not fired today oh it doesn't taste like um milk their cheese does taste like milk it's what uh that's what i don't do okay i'm gonna say this is like 25 to 30 percent better yeah you got your standard cheese your pepperoni this one more cheese more bite more garlic more flavor that's what butt better is all about why'd you throw him like that sorry we win again but better episode this is there's no way 30 something [Music] you want to know what else is stuffed to the brim and ready to ooze hot cheese into your mouth b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our pizza pizza and you know how it went you know i kind of wish that i'd used like a pizza oven that's wood fire but the only issue is that might have been a little too hot to actually bake that internal cheese and it just i don't know but i'm gonna test it again if you have a home pizza oven definitely give it a shot in there too and the the more color the better on on a pizza maybe get a little closer to a neapolitan style if possible which is already so far away from it doesn't matter anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave

one, but two dipping sauces?

Recipe: https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/crispiest-homemade-on...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, so get a little bar or pup you get some onion rings oh they're pretty good but you know how we do it around here they can be much much better [Music] okay so today we're talking about onion rings but not just the simple onion all right it's about the technique and it's about what kind of batter is it gonna be tempura that's better or is it gonna be maybe more of a traditional breadcrumb route that's better that's what we're gonna find out today we're gonna make two different versions the best way that we can and well taste test and see which is better i don't really i think that that actually suffices pretty pretty good so so with all that said let's make this shall we okay we have two different rings traditional breaded rings and tempura boys each having a different sauce to accompany as usual we'll start with mr traditional first let's make our onion dipping sauce in a medium sized bowl add three quarters of a cup of mayonnaise a third cup of ketchup one tablespoon of dijon oop make sure to almost break your wrist with that simple movement two cloves of garlic that have been grated one tablespoon of oyster or porcini mushroom powder which is literally just dried mushrooms ground up totally optional but you know you won't be flexing if you don't do it two tablespoons of hot sauce this is valentina's and two teaspoons of worcestershire sauce give that some whiskey business until thoroughly combined and that's your traditional onion ring now for your actual you must first acquire two to three large yellow onion no need to peel it yet simply cut off the tops then cut it into half inch rings as close to the root as possible to reduce waste peel the outer first layer and then carefully pop them out into multiple individual rings please don't break them unless you want to make papa mad also another thing to watch out for is this little membrane in between each ring definitely remove this if it's dangling off because it can prevent the batter from sticking properly it's good onion ring practice now once you have your rings that's it your onion rings are now done haha get it it's a joke because it's uh stupid these are going to need a three-way dredge station one with flour one with batter and one with panko bread crumbs for your batter start with one cup of all-purpose flour in a medium-sized bowl then add one teaspoon of baking powder one tablespoon of smoked paprika one tablespoon of garlic powder and one teaspoon oop right am i okay today a heaping teaspoon of kosher salt i suppose whisk all that together until thoroughly combined separately acquire yourself one and a half cups of whole milk crack an egg in there whisk that until nice and combined then whisk in one tablespoon of dijon mustard whisk the wet into the dry and continue mixing until thoroughly incorporated and you get a nice looking batter separately you'll need a bowl filled with one to one and a half cups of panko bread crumbs and another separate bowl with half a cup of just plain all-purpose flour now that we have our dredging station simply grab a few onions toss them in the flour to thoroughly coat every square inch shake off the excess then fully submerge and dunk into the batter pull it out with a fork let it drain for a couple seconds on a wire rack set over a baking sheet then immediately drop into your panko breadcrumbs and toss the coat thoroughly that is a beautifully coated onion ring then just simply repeat the process with the rest of your onion rings placing them on either a platter or another clean baking sheet to rest as you finish once all of your rings are breaded get a nice pot filled with at least two and a half inches of frying oil this is about a seven quart dutch oven and heated to 365 degrees fahrenheit now once that reaches temp fry your onion rings in batches about four to five at a time for about two to three minutes maybe a flip in between that time to get even color and once they reach a beautiful crisp golden brown carefully remove them from the oil with a spider and drain on a wire rack set over a baking sheet there's a lot of wire racks involved and as soon as they come out of that hot oil immediately season them with salt and repeat with the rest i mean that's the story now you got to do snag a ring dunk and prepare to fly to flavor town on a rocket shaped exactly like an onion we have the traditional onion so these are pretty traditional onion ring uh granted instead of breadcrumbs i did panko because papa like panko because papa likes panko it's a simple concept you got the sauce you got the ring you give it a dunk oh yeah oh yeah you see when you eat this finito to all the bad things around you everything's good life is good got a sweet little onion got some crunchy crunch and salt but more importantly you don't lose the nostalgia tj i want you to come taste this this busting that's okay next is our competitor the tempura style onion ring instead of a mayo base sauce we're gonna make a tensuyu also known as a tempura dipping sauce in a medium sized sauce pot add three quarters of a cup of filtered water a two inch strip of kombu and a quarter cup of bonito flakes heat that over medium heat just until hot and steamy cut the heat right away and let that steep for 15 minutes now while that's steeping in a separate pan add a quarter cup of sake heat that over medium high and as soon as it reaches a boil light it with a kitchen torch or a long lighter be careful because although you may not be able to see the flame i can promise you it's hot and it will make itself known if it touches you in any shape or form this has been safety first with papa anyway as soon as that flame stops the alcohol has been burned off so you can remove the sake from the heat now in a medium-sized bowl strain your kombu bonita water which is actually just a quick doshi then to that you're going to add your sake a quarter cup of mirin and a quarter cup of soy sauce give that a stir and that's your tensu now i'll show you how to use it properly later in the video but let's talk tempura onion rings to make your tempura batter get a large bowl fill it with three cups of all-purpose flour one teaspoon of baking powder and one tablespoon of kosher salt whisk that together until thoroughly combined then get a new bowl because you realize that the other bowl was too small why do i always do this now carefully whisk in three cups of plain club soda carefully i set until it's thoroughly combined and homogenized and now you have a basic tempura batter toss in a couple ice cubes to keep it nice and cold trust me this is helpful now before we fry i just want to make an important side note please cut your onion rings a little closer to more of like a three quarters of an inch or one full inch thick for tempura you always want them a little wider it's just ideal to fry increase the oil temperature to 375 fahrenheit take a ring toss it to coat in just regular all-purpose flour shake off the excess then dunk it into your batter and gently spin the onion as you drop it into your oil let that fry for a couple of seconds then using a chopstick start spinning the onion real quick now while you're spinning it use your other hand to lap up some of the batter and let it naturally drizzle off your hand onto your onion as it spins this is called painting it's not mandatory but it helps get those extra flaky quick pieces on there which is always a good thing you only need to do this for a couple seconds don't do it too long or you get a crust that's way too fat deep now continue frying with a flip halfway through for about three to four minutes or until it's a beautiful golden color fish that out using a spider or chopsticks and drain on a wire rack set over a baking sheet again while that's still hot immediately season it with salt and a light sprinkling of togarashi seasoning also known as shimi togarashi it's a japanese citrus and pepper seasoning if you don't know what that is then repeat with the rest of your tempura onion rings and let me preface that with these take practice but they're worth it once you get them right just please just try now to serve these all you need to do is first prep your sauce heat your tencyu back up until it's nice and hot then in either a very large ramekin or split between multiple ramekins add one teaspoon of fresh grated ginger and one tablespoon of fresh grated daikon like you know the big boy daikon like this you like that huh then pour your hot tension you over that arrange on your onion rings dunk let it absorb a little and put that beautiful tempura crown in thine mouth now we've got a little bit more of a nicer presentation oh now this is a tensu sauce not many of you might know what that is but it's it's tempora sauce [Music] yeah this is a clear winner for me they're rich yet delicate they're lacy they're ultra airy crunchy like super crunchy you got the spice of the togarashi and you've got this umami just black sauce to dip in and when it's hot and ready i don't know that it can get much better than that you want to know what else is full of big rings full of giant holes [Music] b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our own [Music] look at the end of the day both versions were delicious i was a big fan of the traditional but i gotta say a good tempura onion ring is almost completely unbeatable and that nice tan tsuyu that you dip it in and it's warm and it's got the um so gemmy i know everybody has different tastes and if i were to put an onion ring on a burger i definitely would have chosen the original route plus you can't really get past a nice creamy sauce so anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] you

In order to make this happen, we have to simplify the recipe, maximize the flavor and make this dish for the very cheapest...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, so you want a traditional tasting curry but then there's the price this spices and the price of the butter and all the fats and the milk just what if i told you you could have a curry say a butter chicken for this price right here per serving that is but cheaper [Music] so when you go to a restaurant you're looking at getting a curry it can end up being 10 15 20 25 that's because all those spices all those expensive sort of fats whether it's coconut milk or heavy cream or lots of butter we just need to condense it somehow simplify it while maximizing its flavor so with all that said let's make this shall we right uh cheap curry josh okay resist the truffles resist the fancy spices okay start off with a medium sized bowl add one cup or 240 grams of full fat yogurt then whisk in one tablespoon or 15 grams of garam masala and 1 tablespoon or 15 grams of kosher salt whisk that together tilt thoroughly combined then separately get yourself one and a half pounds or 680 grams of boneless skinless chicken thighs slice those into nice bite-sized pieces that are around one inch thick as per usual keep them even keep papa happy simple concept toss all your chicken into its creamy bath then mix that together until thoroughly coated give it a little sound check lovingly then just cover that with plastic wrap and let that marinate for at least 30 minutes but ideally overnight granted you could skip the marinade entirely but it makes a flavor difference okay next up get yourself a large deep pan like a brazer or a medium sized pot heat two tablespoons or 30 grams of vegetable oil over medium high heat once that's shimmering and hotter than my buttocks after sitting on a chair that doesn't really breathe very well add your marinated chicken in batches to avoid overcrowding and sear for two to three minutes flip should be nice and golden brown maybe even lightly charred and sear the other side for another two minutes we just want color as fast as possible you don't want to cook the chicken all the way through yet now once all of your chicken is beautifully browned make sure the pan is clear then hit it with a touch more oil then lower your heat to medium and add one yellow onion that's been evenly diced a two inch knob of ginger that's been finely diced or more specifically brunoise for the culinary height beasts watching and six cloves of sliced garlic season that to taste with kosher salt fresh ground black pepper then cook and stir making sure to scrape the bottom and if you have an especially thick fond like i did that's the brown good stuck stuff on the bottom you can add a small splash of water to loosen that now make sure to cook all that water off then just saute your vegetables for about 3 minutes or until everything has been softened then add two teaspoons or eight grams of smoked or regular paprika two teaspoons or nine grams of ground cumin one tablespoon or 14 grams of garam masala one and a half teaspoons or six grams of turmeric powder which is completely optional then stir that together and let those spices toast for about one to two minutes or until intensely fragrant then add a 14 ounce can of good quality crushed tomatoes swirl around 2 3 of a cup or 160 milliliters of water in that can then dump it back into your pan less wasteful and you need the water stir together until everything is incorporated leave that on medium heat until it begins to simmer then just let that simmer and reduce for five to eight minutes or until the sauce has been reduced about 30 and is thickened optionally you can use a hand blender to get a little smoother but believe it or not i won't roast you if you don't use one now once that's nicely reduced add your chicken back to the pan distribute throughout the sauce and let it simmer another three to five minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and hot and look you can totally use a lid to speed up that process now last but not least my favorite part pour in one cup or 240 milliliters of heavy cream look at the creamy streamy then just stir all that together bring it up to a light simmer then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for no more than about three to four minutes stirring often then last but not least turn off the heat and stir in 2 tablespoons or 28 grams of unsalted butter important note continuously stir as that's melting so that it emulsifies properly into the sauce now give it a little taste adjust salt levels if needed and just look at this curry just one look at this curry and you're gonna be saying lord i have mercy i'm about to bust now all you gotta do is get a nice shallow bowl hit it with your desired amount of beautifully steamed rice a generous portion of your curry some additional sauce for good measure and of course some fresh cilantro leaves all for this price per serving rat gosh darn hair now let's taste test to see if its flavor is as luxurious as it looks wow wow and for this price right here what that's so good beautiful curry it's thick juicy luscious silky i caught it it's been blessed wow this really actually doesn't taste any different than any of the other curries that i've made which are all amazing for the record but i pulled back on this more extravagant spices that i would normally use but really we ended up with a curry that is honestly just as flavorful and emphasizes the more simplistic aspect while saving money do you want to save money or not and have it be really yummy that heads i've made the chicken tikka masala a million times over this just seems like an easier way to do it and it's just as good so if you like that i think you'll like this okay you're well this isn't about better we stole one we still won the fight for yummy yummy yummy yummy yeah but cheaper this price for a curry please enjoy you want to know what else is creamy hot and made for your mouth b-roll [Music] okay so we made our butt cheaper curry for this price right here per serving that's per serving folks all right a lot of people get mad about it oh look at that i have to go buy this shut up i really think it has all those classic flavors that you expect in a curry but obviously it's not as expensive and it's easy you can put this thing together in like 15 minutes not ex including the marinating time but like are you really gonna count me for that fine skip the marinating and it takes 15 minutes anyway the point is that is a proper butt cheaper of a curry and if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time papa very confused and tired papa take a nap okay good night

195,195,The Perfect Homemade Omelet (3 Ways),https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p3EwVIpzFjI/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBMLEMFkskqSH_qqTSBaTMuKwrY0Q,p3EwVIpzFjI,"8 minutes, 35 seconds","Whether you say omelet or omelette, this is the only recipe guide you need. We're making my 3 favorite styles of omelet, french, country-style American, and my weird version. Cheesy homemade...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, i'm tired of everyone being afraid to make an omelet after this guide i'll have you sing omelette [Music] okay so today we are making omelets not just any omelettes we're making omelets three different ways we have a country style omelette a traditional french omelet with ooey gooey inside and last but not least a special mystery omelette that i make that i talked about uh a long time ago i will discuss that later but the point is this is all about technique attention to detail and not being so scary weary little pants oh i'm so scared shut up you can do this so with all that said let's make this shall we here's something interesting an omelet is pretty much always the exact same ingredient every time you make one but the technique is what classifies it now let us begin with what would be classified as a country-style omelette yes with color first begin with a medium-sized bowl crack four eggs into that bowl and also please get into the habit of cracking on a flat surface instead of the edge of your bowl unless you enjoy shell in your eggs and if you do seek help give your eggs a little tickle then season the taste with salt yes season your eggs before cooking it helps denature their protein intentionally and of course some fresh cracked black pepper optionally you can add a small splotch of heavy cream then in a 10 inch non-stick pan add 2 tablespoons or 28 grams of unsalted butter heat that over medium heat and as soon as the butter is fully melted and bubbling whisk your eggs together until thoroughly combined and homogenized probably you should have done that before and then pour your eggs into the pan now let that cook in as soon as you see the edges begin to set which will happen after just a few seconds pull them towards the center all around the perimeter of the omelet then again pull them towards the center let them cook pull to the center cook pull to the center you see where we're going with this you're going to repeat this process until most of the egg is cooked now when it starts to get close you'll have to tilt your pin into the direction of the pole to get the eggs to pool on that side and once the eggs for the most part are set and they won't pull up anymore add any cheese of your choice this is shredded aged cheddar onto one half of the omelette then fold the uncovered half over and optionally you can add an additional tablespoon of butter till your pan and let the butter fill and toast the underside of your omelette until lightly browned about 20 to 30 seconds then immediately grab a plate and while holding your pan underhanded invert the pan onto your plate to get your beautifully browned country style omelet out and the rest is simple grab your eating utensils cut yourself a slice and slide it into your mouth okay so look at this this is a country omelette a lot of people are like josh this omelet's overcooked no no it's not you're supposed to cook the eggs almost all the way through on a country omelet don't talk to me if you don't know that you can see that it's nice and moisturized in here look at that if it don't do that i don't want it this is good the eggs are delicate it's buttery it's rich there's a tiny little bit of springiness in the eggs but in a good way i mean it's everything you want and this nice little bit of browning on the egg sort of creates a whitney skin that has like a little bit of you know that my hard reaction flavor that we all know and love if you like crispy eggs when you make fried eggs this is your omelet now we've gotten this out of the way next up is a french okay the next one is the omelet that many wish they could do properly and i think they can just takes a little practice so here we go start off with a medium-sized bowl crack in four whole eggs season them to taste with salt to denature its protein and well season it no your eggs won't go watery so please relax internet culinary freakin dweebs anyway whisk together until fully homogenized i want no egg whites floating around in there then heat a non-stick 10 inch pan over medium heat add about one and a half to two tablespoons of unsalted butter and as soon as it's nearly fully melted but not bubbling violently or ultra hot pour in your eggs and as soon as those eggs touch that pan immediately begin stirring with either wooden chopsticks or a rubber spatula i personally prefer the spatula because it covers more surface area but you know whatever now you're going to constantly stir on the heat and as soon as some tiny curds begin to form take it off the heat for a few seconds but keep stirring then return to the heat and repeat this process a couple of times constant stirring on and off the heat and this will take about two to three minutes and as soon as your eggs stop being super runny and look more like a very soft scramble immediately reduce your heat to low bring your eggs to the front of the pan by tapping and lightly scraping leaving a thin layer of egg along the rest of the pan is this making sense i usually do this by feel people anyway at this point you can add your cheese i got a beautiful piece of which i grated and added a generous handful now using your spatula gently roll the part of the omelet that's closest to you all the way down until it meets with that soft scramble then loosen the edges of the other side tuck everything together nicely so it encases your soft scramble and quickly but gently invert onto a plate and look at that it's like kind of like a like a forbidden banana then simply hit it with some fresh sliced chives a nice crack of black pepper and maybe some black truffle except it kept sliding off so never mind i guess we gotta see that cross section slice it in half and let's see our masterpiece now that's a proper french omelette looks absolutely blessing if i do say so myself now let us taste test that's the kind of energy we're going at this french omelet a traditional french omelet is no color smooth exterior the inside is luscious juicy loosey-goosey soft scrambled eggs it's not undercooked not raw okay it's fully cooked it's like the gordon ramsay soft scramble with inside of an omelette yeah it's real juicy that is a traditional french omelet this is the kind of thing that you hear about the famous story of the chef saying you want to work for me you must first cook a french omelet and if you don't then get a fork right in the behind this takes practice not everybody's gonna be able to do it very easily and it's very dependent on how non-stick your pan is so please make sure it's good and whatever you do don't use a metal fork and you're doing it okay now we have one more now let's do that okay one last quick recipe this is that special weird fried omelette that i was talking about in my food diaries on harper's bazaar which i make for my breakfast all the time it's really simple heat two tablespoons of unsalted butter in a non-stick pan over medium heat and as soon as that begins to bubble and it's fully melted crack in four whole eggs let those cook just until the whites are set hit it with some salt then add a lid and let them cook for 30 more seconds just to take care of any extra uncooked egg white but leave the yolks runny or you make a sad papa then simply add the cheese of your choice we got some more cave age gruyere for the full culinary flecks add that onto half of your omelet optionally get it extra melted with a torch snag your spatula and fold that bad boy in half carefully so you don't break your freaking yolks either and look whether you like it or not this is how i like to eat it pop it onto a plate hit it with some hot sauce maybe some black truffle if you have it on hand shout out to the homies at regalis foods for keeping me absolutely strapped with these baddies look in the bio if you want to check them out anyway some fresh cracked black pepper thinly sliced chives get an egg to absolutely boss for you and serve with the toast of your choice this would also be great on a toasted croissant just side note your breakfast game is forever changed i don't want to eat anymore i'm eating a lot today all right please don't make me eat a lot of people were like what the heck a fried egg cheese omelet that's genius and it really is as straightforward as it sounds as you can see so it does have a little taste i mean it's perfect it's perfect it's the best of both worlds and if you're on a diet you can make this macro friendly you get the beautiful balance of the nice running egg yolks of a fried egg then you also get the cheesy whole and the eating experience of an omelette what could you possibly want more than that eat it serve it with toast that is papa's omelet guide finito you want to know what else is full of tubes flowing with goopy yum yum yikes beer [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made omelettes three different ways we had our country style our traditional and my weird sort of fried egg version that i don't know why i make it but it's it's really shockingly good and if you have a little little english muffin or a piece of toast and you dip that in the egg yolk and you got the cheese and it's runny and delicious it's a perfect meal okay i'm trying to give you the goddang value just just take it i hope that this upgrades your breakfast don't be afraid to try new things you'll find out hey wait a minute that's not that hard maybe i'll just listen to peppa so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave

Some may say that Uncle Roger's fried rice recipe is perfect. However, this is But Better...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, if you know uncle roger you know he's a pretty good judge of fried rice he even judged gordon ramsay and he just released his own fried rice recipe and some might say it's a perfect recipe but i know we can make it better [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so we've never done this before we've never but better somebody else's recipe and yet here we are the first thing we need to do is meticulously review uncle roger's fried rice video see how he does it and then we make our own and do it well ideally better this isn't really a competition it's more so how do we elevate this individual's rescue because i think his judgments are actually quite legitimate and helpful for the culinary community so with all that said let's make this shall we this is a little bit different of a butt better normally we go through the drive-through and we go get food this requires us to watch a video now let's begin for the record i actually love uncle roger i've watched him multiple times and i find him very entertaining he's got the right attitude double onioning this one all right i respect that oh when he chopped that green onion his hand was like this and he was just like that requires msg this is one of the things that i love about uncle roger his love and appreciation for msg has actually brought it back to the forefront of cuisine and that's what we need you know you use it sparingly don't like use it as a crutch but my god peanut oil because uncle roger loves to kill all the weak peanut allergy people little peanut energy you can have a little peanut and then you just die imagine just seeing a peanut on the table and you're just afraid for your life you're like [Music] all by the book all by the book he sauteed his veg softened eggs go in but it's almost all solid like this he's got a good stirring technique going on oh my god he's still going stop stop too much he added so much msg he added like a quarter cup of that he was just going with that uncle roger you know better oh the flip that looks nice that looks good honestly this his fried rice really does look good not bad a lot of msg wonder how that happened we have the data that we need uncle roger that's a good looking fried rice now i do think that we can do better okay before we can even start making your fried rice you need well rice but let me make an important point it must be leftover cold rice not fresh cooked and i'm not sorry about it wow just make extra rice next time with that said let's talk about how to cook your rice uncle roger is correct the holy grail of rice cookery is a beautiful rice cooker i've said it before and i'll say it forever this is my zojirushi and the link will be in the description to make the rice place a nice medium grain white rice in a metal sieve set over a bowl fill it up with water toss and rinse your rice thoroughly look at all that starch washing off then drain your water fill one more time and agitate and rinse yet again drain the water again and your rice should be beautifully washed place that in a rice cooker and add roughly equal parts of water this was two cups of medium grain so i used about two cups of filtered water but you can always use the finger test now close the lid start the rice cooker dance to the song of its people and enjoy perfect rice now obviously this rice needs to be cooled so i'm going to refrigerate it covered overnight or you know just make rice and have leftovers for our fried rice sauce get a small bowl add a 1 inch knob of galangal that's been finely grated 1 teaspoon of sesame oil one tablespoon of malaysian sambal three cloves of finely chopped garlic one tablespoon of sweet soy sauce and one and a half tablespoons of double aged soy sauce mix that together until thoroughly combined and that's your sauce which you'll see in action later now we have another important thing to do before we make our fried rice but first let me show you my walks gordon might have two walks [Music] but i have three wigs okay now we're gonna fry some shallots get three nice evenly sized plump shallots cut their tops off but leave them whole peel their skins off and then slice them about an eighth of an inch thick you really wanna keep these cuts as even as possible or your shallots will brown on evenly and papa no like now get a wok fill it with about three cups of vegetable oil and your shallots yes while they're all cold set it over a burner over medium-high heat and begin constantly stirring with chopsticks these are some long boy chopsticks that i like to use to keep your hands safe from the oil after a few minutes your oil will begin to bubble then increase to a vigorous fry and at this point we're still constantly stirring and as soon as your shouts begin to reach a golden brown and they aren't quite bubbling anymore immediately remove them from the oil with a spider and drain them on a paper towel they will continue to brown after pulling so if you don't pull them fast enough they'll burn and that's bad then immediately season with salt to taste and those are your fried shallots now let's finish this bad boy off get your most beautiful big juicy wok place it on your stove drizzle in three tablespoons of vegetable oil and begin heating over medium-high swirl the oil around your wok and keep heating until the oil begins to smoke swirl it around again then pour your oil out make sure to let the oil cool before you throw it away unless you want to melt your trash bag wipe out your wok with a paper towel and your walk is ready to go to work from there i added three and a half tablespoons of cold smoked duck fat yes you know i like to flex you literally just take some rendered out duck fat place it in a small bowl wrap it in plastic wrap insert a tube of a cold smoke gun such as a breville assuming you have one if you don't i guess you just enjoy this cold smoke it with the wood of your choice then let it sit for five minutes and repeat until it's as smoky as you like it maybe a little overboard but just trust papa anyway heat that over medium-high heat and once it's melted and ripping hot add in four cloves of thinly sliced garlic and fry stirring constantly just until they begin to toast to a light brown then immediately add 2 finely diced shallots 2 finely diced red chilies these are red fresno chilies and 2 green onions which have been finely sliced add more oil if necessary and stir fry over medium heat for about 2-3 minutes or until all of your vegetables are beautifully softened and fragrant then in a small bowl crack two to three large eggs whisk them together till homogenized then add them to your stir fried vegetables along with a small pinch of salt let that cook for a couple seconds then stir-fry together try not to break up your eggs too much all right we're not making soft scrambled eggs you want little pieces to bite into it's nice then once your eggs are nice and cooked and look like this add three and a half to four cups of already cooked cold rice unless you cooked it poorly then just throw it in the trash stir-fry that together for two minutes or until the rice begins to lightly toast in some areas and everything is hot then add 2 teaspoons of ground white pepper and 2 teaspoons of you guessed it papa's favorite cheat coat of cuisine toss it all together turn off the heat and finally grab some strawberry jam and that's a joke that's a joke all right not gonna make that mistake instead add your fried rice sauce from earlier you know with the galangal and all that stir and toss that together until evenly distributed and mixed throughout we do this with the heat off to retain those nice sharp delicate garlic and galangal flavors without them going bitter then just pop your fried rice onto a nice plate hit it with your incredibly quippy fried shallots some thinly sliced green onion and i believe that it's about time that we taste test this okay so this is one of the first times we've ever done a butt better and not tasted the food that we're butt bettering hypothetically his could be better but judging off what we saw how that video went this looks pretty good spoon [Applause] that is a beautiful most amazing fried rice the msg in this really hits it's different you got the spice from the chili and the sambal that toasty garlic the crunchy toasty shallots and i really like that contrast of like fresh garlic flavor and toasted garlic flavor it really plays well this is one of the more deeply flavored fried rice that i've had normally it's like kind of flat and like you get very basic flavors the one that uncle roger did looks very good but it's also very basic in flavor this is intense it's layered it's got many many layers of flavor uncle roger i wanna know how did i do you wanna know what else is full of perfectly cooked rice and beautiful long-haired men well maybe not the last part but b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made uncle rogers fried rice butt better and we absolutely slang or i hope we did look at the end of the day uncle roger if you're watching i hope you love this i hope you enjoy it i did this for you i did this for the people we did this for everybody the whole point was well so shine the light on a proper fried rice and hopefully uncle roger you you like it maybe maybe you get a widow kiss i'm sorry you don't like the baby boys oh it's so hard those people have long clicked off at this point uncle roger papakis so with all that said if you enjoyed this video

trip with the boys i feel fine now i'm not sure how i'm going to feel when i'm actually there after 24 hours so uh let's go and let's find out [Music] pit stop time at texas favorite location of all time buckies if this isn't the most clout built gas station in the world i don't know what is oh my gosh you can get it's like a little convenience store and you can get fresh roasted nuts and stuff there's like a culture here there just shouldn't be so i'm gonna go pump my gas now [Music] [Applause] so we've arrived it was a long but uh productive drive we have the rest of the day and then tomorrow morning bright and early so when it's going to be happening we're going to go in to the restaurant we'll take it one hour at a time times 24. i guess i'll catch up on my rest now or something i don't know what is my sleep schedule like what am i doing at 7 am do i go to sleep for the whole day or do i just stay up until night time the next day then sleep like 12 hours i normally always stay up further until the next night and then just crash [Music] it's six o'clock we're supposed to be there at seven o'clock got my chef shoes on let's go so we're here raduchiko i gotta go get my chef coat on and then we're going to commit to a 24-hour cooking challenge this isn't just some restaurant or some fast food restaurant this is hardcore i'm talking like anywhere from seven to 20 components per dish fine dining for 24 hours straight i know i've said it a lot but go get my coat on now we're gonna do [Music] this [Music] these are the old ones they don't even get they don't even give these out anymore okay so this is a first check-in uh and i feel good i feel good i feel strong i haven't been in this fit in a while and it feels like it's giving me power so uh i'm ready for it i'm ready for anything and i'm determined to win and by when i mean complete this challenge we can tap out at any time for the record there's a tap out timer so it's whether or not i'm going to complete the 24 hours or not can i do it yes i can now going to wash my hands [Music] this is all about bulk work vikram everything that the prep team does is basically big not you're not going to put trash bags on three trash cans you're gonna put trash bags on 30 trash cans you're not gonna make one cup of sauce you're gonna make like several gallons and that's that's what we're gonna do today [Music] [Applause] [Music] everybody needs to have something to put their trash away in because obviously you produce a lot of scrap this is like an extra one it's been so long since i've done this i don't know but somebody else is making the list now yeah okay i didn't see i didn't know that we're missing more than half the team so it's going to be a fun morning for all of us some some things are going to be like one court two courts some things are going to be like gallons i have one two three four five six six sauces five vegetable cuts so i'm getting dashi on right now i'm waiting for him to finish with that and then i gotta i'm gonna jump on the edamame jalapeno cashew butter and then beer mustard once that all that's knocked out then i'm going to do all my vegetable prep spank me [Music] this book is one of the oldest books i think in this kitchen name at this point most people have come and gone if they still have their books those who cook in restaurants know about this but this is a very old book it looks like something from the 1800s this is my old recipe book so all the recipes that i've ever made in this restaurant are all in here secrets [Music] the key to prep or really cooking anything is layering tasks you want multiple things happening at the same time i'm talking i'm filling some water picking this i'm grabbing that you're doing multiple things all at once keep wanting to say alexa set a timer doshi japanese sea stock when i came back here immediately felt natural but then there's just like these little awkward pieces oh yeah where i'm like i'm like i know where this is and then i get there and i'm like but i don't the more i do each motion the more it comes back it's like muscle memory we just finished putting everything away the prep team over there is prepping right now and then now we got our pastry chefs over here working away making beautiful delicate pastries the vibes are good the vibes are strong we're going to maintain emotional and physical composure through this entire 24 hours that's the goal most restaurants they have a dishwasher but we wash our own dishes here kind of relaxing actually lynch kale grilled naggy beer mustard dashi about to finish cashew butter then edj avocados and onion rings and we're good when i worked here i used to just say a bunch of things that i still say but like i would say sausage mushroom pizza when i left they bought me the biggest sausage mushroom pizza i've ever seen and it said we're going to miss you and it's a mushroom pizza on it mushroom pizza whenever you season something especially a sauce you want to season it all the way to the max as far as it will go salt not too salty but just before that because this this only gets a little dollop on the plate so you really want it to be punchy so they can taste the cashew butter that they're or whatever sauce they're going to be eating it's been what six five hours yeah five hours okay not bad math math on the way up yeah i mean i feel feel fine obviously this is we're not even done with a normal shift at this point so i feel great honestly uh we do have a we have until about three o'clock to be completely done but i'm gonna put this order away once i'm done with my list i'll start helping them break down the rest of their lists hey my name is uh win win i just been with the company for about five and a half six years i'm a sushi chef here and yeah this is our daily routine we break down salmon ocean trout ghetto tail and other various fish from all over the world today we'll be cutting uh these three fish this is a harami flounder suzuki sea bass and a kampachi which is an amberjack we have our section of bluefin tuna this is the lean part known as the kami the medium fatty the true toro and the overalls mini check-in i'm cutting a lot of avocados this is my last project of the day the prep squad and then i'm going to jump hopefully on family meal in time if i can finish this fast they're already putting family meal up it's it's at two o'clock now instead of three o'clock so family meal used to be at three now it's it's at two which means it starts in like three minutes i was gonna help them but i didn't know that so family meal which is basically when around one to two people will be assigned to make food for the whole restaurant we all sit down socially distance we eat our food before we go into service you gotta have calories in your body good food uh to push you through the whole night that's what they're making i think they're making shepherd's pies so i'm very excited about that we'll have josh with us today i'm sure everybody's ready [Applause] happy to see everybody and a ton of new faces a ton of old faces i wasn't sure how it's gonna feel when i came back in the kitchen i thought it was gonna feel unnatural but it feels very natural and it's uh good to see everybody in a good mood having a good attitude through these times just like pretty usual guys i just want to again thank everybody for all the efforts you put in as far as just the way the world has changes and the things we're having to deal with you all have done a really amazing job of kind of coming together being both responsible inside and outside of the workplace so again just thank you have a great day [Music] pre-shift is over we've eaten and we're about to go into service and we said four now so we have one hour roughly until service feel good technically the shift would be over not by now but now we're gonna transition to the line so i don't know where we're gonna go first i'll figure that out [Music] okay we're outside and away from people so i can take this off for a second so it's four four o'clock technically by now the first ship would've been done so we're going into the second shift i thought i would be tired by now but i feel good maybe it's the adrenaline maybe uh maybe like just be excited seeing everybody and have not been here for a while but feel pretty good and we're about to go into service now and i'm just going to bounce around and work every single position on the line and i don't know i don't know what's going to happen next we're not we're not even halfway done [Music] josh has six muppet baby tattoos trying to guess where they are tattoos bro puppet baby [Music] feeling good service has been going on for about an hour not much on that station been really chill not a ton of orders honestly i've been prepping and i put out like four plates and that's about it so i'm probably gonna hop to another station very shortly [Music] on this tempura station instead of having a fry later like that's automated this restaurant uses two gigantic copper pots so you control the heat with three different knobs and you fry everything with two giant chopsticks feeling the vibe i think uh josh's doing great he's stepping back in and uh like he never left [Music] services about halfway done roughly a little more so we're we'll be done at 11. i feel good i'm still waiting for that moment where it's gonna be like the wall i don't know maybe the wall is a myth it's all in your mind so might never matter we're gonna do this even harder [Music] uh what are we plating the uh bok choy in right now the last time i made a bok choy was 10 months ago i feel like accustomed to all this but after not working in a restaurant for about 10 months everything is less [Music] automatic nine o'clock starting to feel the effects of being up but i feel good chef zach how do you feel another night so great he feels great i feel fine it's all [Music] positive ten so that means that we have nine more hours [Music] what 11 p.m i don't feel i mean i'm i'm tired i don't feel like i've been up for 24 hours yet obviously i feel like that's gonna feel different but i definitely feel it now it has hit it went from like wow i feel fine fine fine time fine there was no gradual decrease it just was like damn you're tired and then it slowly starts to go downhill from there so yeah wouldn't mind like just going to sleep everybody's cleaned up every most people have left now we just gotta put all of our stuff away and then we gotta get ready for the cleaning crew who's gonna get here start sort of cleaning all this stuff that's out here they're gonna clean the hood vents we're gonna do all that with them but in the meantime i'm going to break this down and then we'll see them probably i think in 30 minutes maybe we'll sit down for a second so it's one am this is the one i am checking oh if you get this one there you go obviously i feel tired you would not feel tired in this very moment i'm having several thoughts go through my mind for one why am i doing this or two is it really worth it and my answer to that is you never really know and sometimes you just gotta commit that's how i feel right now gotta commit i don't feel awake anymore it's 3am it's freezing outside if i'm outside getting fresh air it's cold i feel good i definitely have been slipping away into is this reality am i awake or in my sleep am i dreaming my body's like go home and go to sleep i think we're the only ones in the restaurant now the cleaners in that area have left and now the next round of cleaners are supposed to be here to clean the dining room which i'm gonna help them do that as well but they're not here yet so we're literally just kind of not sure what to do right now so we're just going to chill sit down try not to fall asleep and see when they get here it is now 5 a.m and i think i've hit what whoa what was i gonna say and i think i finally hit what tj has called the after glow and by that i mean yes i'm tired but i feel like somehow i just woke up i don't know how that happened it just it just happened we're still waiting for someone else to be here there's literally still nobody here we were expecting the second round of cleaners doesn't matter we're not leaving this building until seven in the morning damn it two more hours whenever you wring out a mop i'll just put it in there twirl it up like paschetti that way when you ring it out really get the juice so it's 7 00 a.m we've made it it's been 24 hours uh i feel i feel good actually i feel feel really good for two reasons for one because we committed and we did it all right there's no giving up we won this challenge we always follow challenges all the way through to the end it's not about winning or losing it's about committing and with conviction and then the second reason is that this was to tell a story was to show people what goes on in a restaurant like this what does it take to run a restaurant like this how much work goes into each and every single job from the prep cooks to the line cooks to the sous chefs to the executive chefs to the even to the people that clean the restaurant it is a big job to run a restaurant especially during this time with kovid and everything going on the moral of the story is support your local restaurants be kind to your waiters and waitresses this is for those people if you have a local restaurant that you like any respect go out and support them i'm very tired and i'm gonna go lay down and i'm not really sure what to do with my sleep schedule now so we're gonna go figure that out now but anyway if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see

It's not a difficult...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, this is one of those things you usually defer to a restaurant to make but i'm telling you now you can do it and if you do it might just be the very best one that you ever have in your life [Music] okay so today we're making pad thai we're gonna make this as traditionally as we possibly can given the location and there are certain ingredients that we can acquire but we're gonna do our very best to have all the proper ingredients and do it simply but authentically it's not difficult it really is not it's just a matter of a little bit of proper technique having the right ingredients please do not sub ingredients it's too often that people see something and they don't think that they can find it just just please take a couple seconds and try to find a local asian market go and grab this stuff because you will thank yourself for it now with all that said let's make this shall we okay folks there are a couple of ingredients in here that are extremely easy to find at local asian grocery stores or on amazon so don't go complaining to me and i'll do my best to give you substitutions first thing we need to do is make our pad thai sauce you'll need some tamarind pulp which looks a bit like a brick of poopy but trust me when i say it's full of flavor pull off two ounces place it in a small bowl and mix in half a cup of boiling water keep mixing until it's as smooth and rehydrated as possible then press that through a mesh sieve or chinois and you now have tamarind juice to that you're gonna add three heaping tablespoons of thai palm sugar i like to grate mine because it dissolves easily followed by two tablespoons of fish sauce and one tablespoon of thai black soy sauce mix all that together and that's your pad thai zhu if you will dark rich and so darn good you'll practically hallucinate when you taste it next up get half a pound of chicken breast plop that on a board and slice that beauty into nice third inch slices and try to keep these even so they guess what cook evenly to the chicken you're gonna add a generous pinch of kosher salt one teaspoon of ground white pepper two teaspoons of cornstarch toss all that together to coat then add two teaspoons of thai sweet soy sauce mix together again only to realize that not all of your cornstarch came out and all right now let's talk nudes i mean noodles y'all are always thinking too damn nasty too nasty you'll need about eight ounces of dried pad thai rice noodles pop those into a large bowl and cover with hot water make sure they're completely submerged and let them soak for 15 to 20 minutes or until the texture is al dente then drain the water out through a colander and your nudes are hot and ready now before we stir fry everything together let me introduce you to the all-important dried shrimp you don't skip this get yourself a third of a cup of those little men pop them in a food processor and process on high speed until it reaches as fine of a powder as possible sure they smell a little funky but they shan't be excluded it's worth venturing out for papa's special ingredients now we're ready to stir-fry heat a large wok over medium-high heat add 3 tablespoons of high heat cooking oil then once that's shimmering and very hot swirl your pan to coat the edges add your chicken and batches stirring for about two to three minutes per side to get a beautiful golden brown chicken boob that's cooked all the way through no medium rare chicken that's obvious then remove your chicken and set to the side now place your wok back onto the heat heat up another three tablespoons of oil over medium high and once it's screaming hot add in your ground dried shrimp stir-fry shaking the pan vigorously while constantly stirring and let those cook until golden brown and toasted they should smell beautifully fragrant in the most amazing way then add two thinly sliced shallots stir fry that constantly for two to three minutes or just until they begin to soften then add four cloves of garlic which have been thinly sliced stir fry for yet another two minutes then you can optionally add one and a half tablespoons of finely minced zakkai which is thai salted daikon again optional please don't freak out on me all right it's optional stir fry for another minute or two then finally add your soaked and drained rice nudes followed by that beautiful pad thai sauce crank your heat to high and vigorously shake to stir-fry together until all the ingredients are evenly distributed and everything is hot then immediately reduce your heat back down to medium-high push all of your noodles to one side then separately beat together two to three eggs in a bowl until completely homogenized and pour into the empty space that you made in your wok let that cook for 30 seconds then go ahead and just scramble once your eggs are cooked through stir fry that all together to evenly distribute then add 1 cup of chinese garlic chives 1 cup of mung bean sprouts and your cooked chicken stir-fry all that together just until the garlic chives begin to wilt about two more minutes now pull that off the heat and look you can serve this in bowls but honestly i think it looks quite nice in a wok should you serve family style add a generous amount of crushed toasted peanuts that's peanuts not in more additional fresh mung bean sprouts although i don't really love mung bean sprouts that much just a side note i think they're really overrated sorry anyway this looks like a beautiful proper pad thai now let's see if it tastes as good as it makes my body feel when i gaze upon its sensuous beauty pad thai let's go look at that look at that i think this is a great family-style way to plate unless you have anyone that's allergic to peanuts then you can't do this oh peanuts ow just a little nothing to hurt me no ah i'm gonna get a plate this is a family style plate up so obviously you don't eat out of here unless you're nasty i don't like mung bean sprouts so i'm not putting anything on mine oh my god i'm stumped and not because i don't know how to describe this flavor but because i don't want to be disrespectful to places that i've had pad thai this hits different if you're gonna order pad thai to go it's already getting ruined along the way the noodles are getting overcooked the egg is getting overcooked and maybe it's not even that good this this is maximizing flavor if you have all the ingredients for this you can find all of them this will be one of the greatest pad thais you ever have unless you go to you know thailand or you have a really good thai restaurant near you most of them will not put it out like this i'm telling you this is this is something he's so excited he just can't hide it uh you have a fork that's illegal but whatever i'll accept it this this does hit dip yeah that goes somewhere else in your body this is a statement i think this is the best pad thai i've ever had [Music] it's that good you heard it here first folks best pad thai vikram's ever had it could be yours too if you it could be yours too and if you want it to be you all got to do is follow this recipe papa love you you want to know what else makes you have late night sweaty dreams about noodles b-roll [Music] alright guys and that is it so we made our pad thai and it came out i keep thinking about it ever since i've made this pad thai i can't stop thinking about it i want to eat it every day i want to smell it wafting through my air conditioning unit up into our bedroom while kate's trying to sleep and all she can smell is like sizzling delicious pad thai that is what you want every day of your life is it not is it not now you can make this so get out there go do it pop i love you and with all that said if you

This is the juiciest crispiest homemade fried chicken sandwich you may ever eat. Stacked tall with thick-cut homemade dill pickles with a secret ingredient....,2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, so we did the nuggets and we triumphed but i think that it's time that we go after the big boy [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today we are making the chick-fil-a sandwich but i've had conversations with many people both professional and unprofessional in the world of cuisine and i've expressed my concerns about this sandwich not that there's anything wrong with it i just think that it's overrated so today we're going to prove why we can make it much better i don't know i'm talking in that cadence with all that said let's make this shall we oh my god is that the line what's with the chicken line i like chicken i mean i get it chicken is gemmy they just get two chick-fil-a sandwiches thank you thank you stay warm goddammit they're so polite here looks like somebody took care of that sign when those chick-fil-a employees go home they like throw up after having to be nice for so long i would i would throw up hello yes thank you so much okay we have a sandwich time to go and have fun okay so we have the bag you're the best part of the day like for them or like are they saying to focus on yourself are they saying like you're the best part of the day for us for our employees i highly doubt that i highly doubt that who's reading this and they're like ah probably somebody's mom it's very it's very sweet a real classic what's all this weird small text it's almost like a threat it's threatening it's like a real classic okay so here we go this is the clout sandwich this is what y'all are worried about okay everyone's like oh the best chicken sandwich this come on untoasted bread chicken the chicken looks pretty good and then two lazily placed pickles 50 of the sandwich is covered in pickles the other 50 is just dry no sauce and this is what everyone goes crazy about i'm a big fan of beauty and simplicity i don't know if this is it chief cheers here's the verdict at the end of the day it's a beauty and simplicity thing yes it tastes good is it as good as it could be not even close is it as juicy as it could be absolutely not this is what i would call dry chicken if we're gonna be riding the cloud mobile we might as well be riding in the biggest baddest cloud mobile we can and i think we could do better all right folks we can't just flex on them without our classic god-tier buns you know them you love them since you've made them so many times on this channel my full detailed buns the recipe will be in the link in the description it's easy so i'll give you the gist you get a small container half cup of water add a half cup of milk get it lukewarm dissolve two and a half teaspoons of instant yeast then in the bowl of a stand mixer whisk together three and a half cups of bread flour one tablespoon of granulated sugar and one and a half teaspoons of fine sea salt pop that on your stand mixer with the dough hook begin mixing this time i added three tablespoons of vegetable oil instead of butter followed by my yeasty milk stuff one egg yolk and one whole egg let that mix until you get a nice smooth plump boy pop it out shape it into a light bulb toss it into a greased bowl cover with plastic wrap and rise for one hour then just punch it down divide and shape it into six evenly sized balls place it on a baking sheet cover and let proof for 30 minutes finally give them a light brush of egg wash toss them in a 375 degree oven for 15 minutes pull them out and brush them with melted butter that's the gist for the most beautiful poppin buns okay the pickles at chick-fil-a are just downright shameful that's all i gotta say for ours you're gonna start with one english cucumber pickling cucumbers are better but work with what you got then just cut that bad boy oop sometimes they run away goodbye into about half inch thick coins i want these to be some fatty gentlemen now place those in a one quart mason jar separately in a medium saucepan add one and a half cups of distilled vinegar three quarters of a cup of water one tablespoon of salt one tablespoon of sugar and voila the magic ingredient two teaspoons of msg chick-fil-a uses msg so we will too bring that to a boil over high heat as soon as it reaches a boil take it off the heat and pour it over your cucumbers let that sit for 1 minute then add 2 cloves of garlic that have been crushed and rough chopped 2-4 sprigs of dill depending on how dilly you like it then just let that sit at room temperature until they're completely cooled now you have a beautiful msg dill pickle then just store these guys in the fridge and they stay good for well months now for our chicken first baking with a small bowl add three tablespoons of kosher salt one tablespoon of sugar and two teaspoons of you guessed it next instead of chicken breast we're using juicy chunky boneless chicken thigh boneless and skinless season your chicken generously with your cure mixture on both sides of course you likely won't use every last bit of your seasoning but don't throw it away put it to the side now either keep your chicken on a small tray or in an airtight container covered with plastic wrap or lid and let them cure in the fridge for 30 minutes but ideally overnight this is important to generating that classic taste you would expect now time to fry get yourself a six to seven quart dutch oven fill it up with about two and a half inches worth of vegetable oil heat that guy to 350 fahrenheit then while that's heating let's make our breading station for the flour dredge get a medium bowl add two cups of all-purpose flour one tablespoon of powdered sugar yes that's correct two tablespoons of garlic powder one tablespoon of smoked paprika two teaspoons of one tablespoon of brown white pepper and one tablespoon of kosher salt whisk that together until thoroughly combined now for the chicken wash get a separate bowl crack in two eggs whisk them together then whisk in one cup of whole milk then finally whatever remaining chicken cure seasoning that you didn't use go ahead and add that too breading your chicken is as easy as hopscotch but first a little trick for you get a couple tablespoons of your chicken wash and drizzle and stir it in vigorously into your dredge this will create tiny little lumps that will then attach to the chicken and create a flaky crust that we all desire now lightly dust a small baking sheet with your flour dredge dunk a piece of chicken in the milkmaid juice that's a chicken wash then drop it into the flour dredge tossed a coat pressing the flour into the chicken aggressively coating every little crevice what does papa say about uncoated spots on chicken no geese once that's coated shake off the excess flour and place on your sheet then simply repeat with the rest of your chicken now once your oils to temp simply drop your chicken in one to two pieces at a time depending on how big your pot is these were some big boys and my pot was a little bit too small so i fried one at a time then just fry for three to five minutes at 350 fahrenheit or until golden brown and the chicken is beautifully cooked through i mean look at that now remove your chicken using a spider and treat it on a wire rack set over a baking sheet then repeat with the rest of your chicken now for assembly i know there's not really sauce that they put specifically on their sandwich which really annoys me of course you can do chick-fil-a and i have a recipe for that in my chick-fil-a chicken nugget video link in the description but instead i made a very simple mustard mayo by literally combining half a cup of mayo half a cup of whole grain mustard and a touch of salt and pepper that's it you just mix that together and it's gemmy now get yourself a nice glossy bun slice it in half butter it up and get it nice and roast toasty in a pan now you get your toasted buns start by first putting a small layer of sauce if you chose that route on your bottom bun then your pickle rounds which yes i do hate pickle rounds okay it's very annoying look i have to put this stupid tiny little piece in the middle to cover the whole gap but i'm trying to be accurate with the whole chick-fil-a sando depiction now hit the top bun with a touch of sauce add on your beautifully voluptuous chicken and of course gently crown your king now that looks like a chicken sandwich that i want inside my body which is precisely what we'll do this feels good fellas this feels real good my sandwich i mean i think we know where this is gonna go let's just do this i did break my pickle cutting rule i've always said to cut them lengthwise to fill out the whole thing and do you see how annoying it was to get that last bit on there all right that's why you follow that rule i don't know why i broke it never break a pop by rule all right this is a thick sandy so where am i hello mama i'd like to use a special word i'm befuddled this is yummy yeah we slam dunk this i have nothing to say other than the chicken is crisp the buns are rich soft and pillowy and these msg pickles they like they make your mouth wet we need a taste tester tj get on in here buddy okay so tj how do you feel about chick-fil-a before we even do this it's kind of indifferent when it comes to chicken sandwiches i always prefer popeyes over chick-fil-a numero uno tun champion it's not really a language just disrespectful okay oh yeah whoa okay numeric two ended yeah yeah that's obvious that's poopy dude the pickles is what set this off for me like the chicken's juicy it's good but the pickles just added that extra to it and that's well it and that's what we did we slam dunk this what better we won yet again chick-fil-a what are you gonna do about it the chick-fil-a people are gonna be all over us saying that oh there's no way it could be better there's a lot of ways that it could be better than this all right and we don't did it you wanna know what else is full of big juicy thighs that you want in your mouth i'm talking about chicken thighs by the way nasty b-roll [Music] all right guys that is it so today we made the chick-fil-a chicken sandwich it wasn't really that hard i mean it's literally just two buns chicken pickles that's it if you really break it down it's kind of a boring sandwich and i don't

200,200,The Cheesiest Homemade Texas Queso (2 Ways),https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sdL8bei1Tcg/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBf6bHUNc0B6I2gY8E_2L8UbPZ3Iw,sdL8bei1Tcg,"7 minutes, 14 seconds","I don't need to say a lot here...cheesy dip, chips, Texas, it's a beautiful thing! We're going to make two versions of Texas queso with one being the traditional American cheese version and...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, look i don't need to say a lot here all right cheesy dip chips texas it's a beautiful thing [Music] this is one of the very few times yet again that you're gonna see me talking about something that may not seem very josh like and by that i mean it's not fancy not everything i eat is fancy guys alright there's some things that i like that are just downright nasty and this is one of them we're gonna make two different versions we're gonna make the traditional version which is unfortunately with like american cheese and we're gonna make josh's fancy version so with all that said let's make this shall we right so you can't have queso without chips i've made my own tortilla chips a few times already on this channel like in the doritos but better video so if you'd like to know how i made my own tortilla chips the link is in the description now let's talk about the main event the queso and not chili cone carne queso i'm talking texas queso you know that like yellowish stuff you see in austin texas first up is the unfortunately fake cheese albeit traditional version in a medium saucepan add two tablespoons of neutral tasting oil heat that over medium heat until very hot then add one medium yellow onion that's been diced followed by two finely diced jalapenos season that to taste with salt stir and let those sweat until oop dang you see that thing flour my hand like that it was like coming after me onions love papa anyway once those just begin to soften add in three cloves of rough chopped garlic saute until everything is softened and fragrant about two to three minutes stir in one nice and ripe diced tomato and saute just until the tomato is hot then add three quarters of a pound of fresh grated here it is boys my nightmare american cheese and a quarter pound of pepper jack cheese also grated immediately followed by one cup of whole milk you don't need a roux here on account of the good old-fashioned engineered spice cheese continue heating over medium heat while stirring constantly until silky smooth and looking something like this season that the taste of salt and finish it with a quarter cup of fresh and finely chopped cilantro pop that in there stir that bad boy and look if you live anywhere in texas this should look quite familiar to you so get that into a bowl top it with some fresh diced tomato rough chopped cilantro and look at that that looks like a proper queso if i've ever seen one despite the fact that we used fake cheese but whatever we'll just overlook that now let's jump over and try something a little more culinarian that's a word right we're using nicer cheese here a classy lightly aged cheddar in a cave aged gruyere first thing start with two and a half tablespoons of unsalted butter in a medium sauce pot heat that over medium heat just until the butter is melted then add two finely diced shallots i mean like really fine and four serranos that have been optionally seeded and sliced finally three cloves of rough chopped garlic season that to taste with salt and fresh cracked black pepper to taste stir and cook until all the veg is nicely softened about two to three minutes sprinkle in two tablespoons of all-purpose flour stir to combine and cook stirring occasionally for about 30 seconds then whisk in one cup of whole milk keep whisking the heating just until that thickens you've now made a bechamel in a separate bowl mix together four and a half cups of shredded cheddar cheese and one cup of shredded gruyere cheese whisk that cheese mixture into your bechamel a little bit at a time until all of it is added turn off the heat and continuously whisk until the cheese is completely melted and you have a nice smooth queso finally finish that off with a half cup of sour cream and that's the full fatty version whisk that in thoroughly adjust salt and pepper levels if necessary now we have our queso but let's talk about plate up or bowl up i guess first get a beautifully ripe avocado assuming you have some sort of advanced avocado seeking abilities which you should at this point dice it up as chunky or as small as you like place a generous mound in the center of your bowl hit it with some flaky salt now pour your hot cheesy queso on top that's uh redundant until you've completely hidden the avocado start by garnishing it with some nicely arranged pickled onions very thinly sliced serrano chilies some daintily placed cilantro leaves and finally slang on a nice drizzle of your hot sauce of choice this one is a classic valentina hot sauce now that right there looks like an upgraded queso not queso now let's taste test this and see if it holds a candle the stinky poopy fake cheese we have queso times two that's oh that's dose that doesn't really does so we have the traditional the velveeta american cheese look this is one of the very few things where i actually might prefer this i don't know and then we have the fancier more thought out more swanier queso now traditional texas queso i mean it's a classic am i gonna freak out about it no but i will say that this tastes identical to any cantina or mexican restaurant that you go to in the central texas area the the fancy one has sat for a while so it might be oh it's not actually get a little bit of everything here hold on hold on now um this is a toss-up i like the kick of this too this is obviously spicier man this is tough here's how i balance this out i don't know if there's a clear winner but textually the original traditional queso i had no idea if that was gonna work or not textually this is the winner the traditional version now flavor-wise undeniably undeniably this is better you've got that rich cheese you can really there's like a level of umami from the cheese that you do not get from this this is almost like it's like craft singles basically and you got the kick from the spice i don't know if i can make a favorite i like them both very much look if you're a traditionalist this is for you you're forward thinking this is for you we need we need a native houston texas opinion we'll go with the og first cheerio proper yeah i went to papacytos three days ago it's very similar honestly i like the traditional yeah that was exactly this this tastes like every time i was away from houston as a kid came home got off the plane and went to a mexican restaurant right away it's almost like traditionally speaking when you're having queso it almost needs to be that sort of like neon yellow fake cheese it's nostalgia and it's the texas way you want to know what else oozes hot steamy cheese into the back of your [Music] throat [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our queso two versions we had the traditional with fake cheese yucky and then we had the sort of fancy version that was made with a roux base so it was essentially an ultra cheesy monet i suppose we've been making a lot of mornay sauces around here haven't we sitting back looking at both of them they're both beautiful in their own way if you're a queso traditionalist you're kind of low-key gonna want the american cheese version unfortunately there's no way around it now if you haven't had it before you should definitely try the fancy version first enjoy that enjoy the palette tantalization and then try the unfancy version i think you'll find the beauty in both after doing it that way so anyway if you enjoyed this video or you learned something

201,201,The 2 Dollar All American Breakfast | But Cheaper,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XOe_FqLwLu4/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLDcMvjpYPuS9NnG216GDj-IiiuABw,XOe_FqLwLu4,"8 minutes, 1 second","The All-American breakfast consists of basic items like eggs, bacon, potatoes of some sorts, toast, or pancakes if you're willing to spend the extra dough. Let me show you how to not spend...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, oh you want to go and have an all-american breakfast and it's only 12 dollars a person with the power of our own home we can make it all american breakfast for this price per person right here that is but cheaper [Music] so okay so if you're not from america you may not know this but an all-american breakfast consists of very basic items eggs bacon toast or pancakes for extra remember pancakes are always extra unless you're at home and you're on but cheaper in which case they're cheaper yes and normally hash browns are some sort of potato so we're gonna make that but we're gonna make it with proper technique a little bit of fanciness and significantly less expensive so with all that said let's make this shall we let's start things off right with the perfect most quippy roast potato look we're going this route instead of the hashbrowns not sorry about it sort of with two pounds of nice smooth boy yukon gold potatoes peel them all nicely then cut them in half or quarters depending on how big they are i find that quartering them is usually the best size because size matters anyway place those in a pot add in enough water to cover the potatoes season it generously with salt and place in the stove over medium high heat let it boil and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or just until the potatoes are soft but not mush no mushy or your potatoes will be so sad papa no like ever drink your potatoes and let them sit and cool long enough until the outside of the potato is nice and dry it's totally fine if they're still hot now snag yourself biking dish generously coat the bottom with about two to three tablespoons of vegetable oil add in your potatoes then rough them up with the bottom of a cup you gotta teach those potatoes that they've been bad little boys ooh spanx bank now cover your potatoes with an additional two to three tablespoons of vegetable oil toss to coat thoroughly and try to keep them in one layer then season them generously with salt and optionally a little bit of pepper to taste then toss those in an oven set to 425 fahrenheit for about 30 minutes taking them out once or twice to toss and turn them until deep golden brown like these feathers right here i mean look at that i want to put that in my mouth now next up we have the famous choice for any all-american breakfast the pancake also one of the most overpriced breakfast items in the game in a medium-sized bowl add one and three quarters of a cup of all-purpose flour followed by one teaspoon of salt one tablespoon of granulated sugar and one tablespoon of baking powder give that some drumroll please whiskey business then in a separate container you'll need one and a quarter cup of whole milk whisk in one egg probably would have been better to do the egg before the milk but whatever then whisk in one tablespoon of vegetable oil from there whisk your wet ingredients into your dry and continue mixing until you have a nice and even batter it's okay if it's a little bit lumpy but definitely do not over mix this then from there it's a typical pancake procedure which i feel like most people know but we'll go through it anyway heat a griddle or non-stick pan a little over medium heat until nice and hot hot potat spray it or grease with a touch of vegetable oil pour in heaping quarter cup scoops of batter i would say three to four at a time don't go above that then let that cook for about two minutes or until it's halfway cooked and the bottom is a nice golden brown carefully flip and repeat on the other side then just repeat this process with all of your cakes of the pan variety now while you're cooking your pancakes you probably want to start cooking your bacon right well yes of course we all love bacon but if you're trying not to blow the bank i have an alternative first you'll need about one pound of ground pork obviously for the full flex i ground mine fresh but i guess you don't have to do that now since i did grind mine i added the spices before it was brown but obviously you can do it after said spices consist of 2 teaspoons of kosher salt 1 teaspoon of garlic powder 2 teaspoons of ground sage half a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and a half teaspoon of allspice mix it all together grind your pork if it's not already ground once thoroughly mixed that right there is a lovely pork breakfast sausage from there just form your pork into two and a half inch wide discs that are about half an inch thick if you get your parameters correct you'll end up with 12 pretty evenly sized patties to cook them simply heat up a very lightly oiled pan over medium-high then place four patties in the pan at a time and sear for two to three minutes or until you get a nice deep brown crust flip and repeat on the other side so you have browning on both sides and the inside is cooked through repeat with as little or as many breakfast sausage patties as you want and let me tell you something these are mad addicting now we have all of our components except one thing the eggs i prefer to fry mine but you can do whatever you want my ideal method is just heating up a non-stick pan over medium heat adding just enough vegetable oil to coat the bottom add your eggs about two or three at a time trying to avoid them you know connecting while they're cooking because that's very annoying then once they cook enough of the white to hold being slit around the pan simply spoon the hot oil over the egg whites until they are fully cooked through like this you'll get crispy lacy edges puffy whites and a nice runny yolk i prefer to season my eggs with salt after cooking to avoid those weird white speckles on the yolks from there assemble your all-american breakfast in the orientation you'd like in my case plate then eggs then your pancakes arranged nicely maybe a little butter pat for the cartoonish nostalgia followed by some shingle sausage patties or bacon if you want to be rich i guess and finally your beautiful roasty toasty tigers oh and of course fully optional but a nice little line of finely sliced chives over your eggs it's pretty good looking now that is a beautiful all-american breakfast for this price per serving right here a good deal for twice the flavor all-american breakfast and for a grand total of i don't know what that noise was but that's the price wow grand total per serving for four of these first thing poscados this is the one and only way you should ever roast a potato for the record they're just like airy and crispy and yummy obviously pancakes get some syrup they're fluffy nice almost juicy because the people don't want me to say moist but they're moist and i mean the eggs perfect if you really want to get fancy you put some flaky salt on them although that's not butt cheap or approved no no no i have a big problem with eggs that aren't crispy i know some people don't like them why would you not want quick little edges in the runny yolk that's a runny yolk and last but not least is our fresh ground breakfast pork sausage this feels like a problem oh american breakfast you spend like 12 to 14 per person when you can have all of this for such a low price and in my opinion it's significantly better not just in quality and flavor but you made it you could be proud of it that's but cheaper all right just just you want to know what else is full of thick cakes an american style breakfast b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our all-american our grand slam whatever you want to call it but cheaper for this price per serving right here i think a lot of people like to be like oh josh what about i have to buy this or that look the reason why we break it down into servings is because if you only use six or eight eggs guess what there's still eggs in the fridge to use later so why would we count that towards the total price if we're not using them whereas if you go to a restaurant and you buy it for this price that's all you get and that's finished that dollar is not getting stretched anymore you basically swallowed that dollar and pushed it out that's a poopy dollar okay we're doing it for you i'm not doing this math for no reason or more specifically i'm not making tj do this math for no reason so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like

for sponsoring this video, check out their KitchenAid FreeFlex™ Third Rack Dishwasher here: https://www.kitchenaid.com/major-appliances/dishwashers/third-rack.html?cmp=kad:ms...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, ever watched one of those mukbang videos and you keep seeing something over and over and you're like man i really wanna eat that well today not only are we gonna eat it we're gonna make it the best way we can we're in a different spot it's okay but if you've ever had yourself a low country ball then you know that that process is so heckin messy that's where today's sponsor kitchenaid comes in with its free flex third rack dishwasher aptly named for its third rack giving more of your dishes a proper place flash my dishes for me they're able to hold more room on top saving space for below it's actually the largest third rack available are they magicians no just uh you know good good engineers honest review i've had it for two months and genuinely the best dishwasher i've ever used it's true but before we even use it i think we need to actually cook something shall we now you may not be on bayou but you sure can make your house smell like it first we're gonna make what i'm calling josh's holy ball seasoning that's holy boil by the way in a medium sized bowl add a 30 cup of smoked paprika three quarters of a cup of old bay seasoning three tablespoons of ground cayenne two tablespoons of mustard powder three and a half tablespoons of kosher salt two tablespoons of sugar three tablespoons of fresh ground black pepper and one tablespoon of coriander seeds that have been lightly toasted and ground finely i used a mortar and pestle to grind mine and finally two teaspoons of dried thyme which i like to crush in between my fingers to get it even finer now give that some whiskey business until thoroughly combined and that is your incredible seasoning before we get our low country ball going let's make some spicy cajun butter you want this trust me don't skip or papa no ever in a medium sized sauce pot add one pound of unsalted butter aggressively exposed heat that over medium heat and let that chunky boy melt down until completely melted then add 12 cloves of garlic yes 12 cloves that have been peeled crushed and minced let that cook for about two to three minutes stirring often or until the garlic is very soft then add three tablespoons of my holy boil seasoning one tablespoon of smoked paprika and two tablespoons of old bay seasoning stir that together and let it cook for another 30 seconds or the spices are lightly toasted and fragrant that is some of the most addicting stuff you will ever place on your tongue now to prepare your boil you need a very large pot and a perforated insert for that more specifically a seafood boil pot that's about 40 quarts in size just trust me this is how proper boil is done fill that bad boy up with water until it reaches a little over the top of your strainer that's inside place it in a stove that ideally has a large stock burner on it turn the heat to high and get that water boiling it will take some time so while that's going let's prep our veg meat and seafood first cut two lemons into slices two heads of garlic cut in half like this two yellow onions that are very roughly chopped and six whole ears of corn that have been peeled and cut in half to get these cute little guys and that's our veg now for the sausage i like to get two pounds of large smoked cooked sausage then just cut those into two to three inch segments now let's talk seafood this is a special boil so calls for a very special ingredient from my homies at regalis foods a whole king crab yes we don't play around here you understand in my case i went ahead and just broke those down to get these two lovely meaty clusters obviously freshness like this is unbeatable but two clusters from your local grocery store will do just fine next up we have our crawfish i got about 40 of these guys which is about two and a half or so pounds now a lot of people argue about purging them look the way i do it is i just cover these guys with fresh water let them sit for about eight minutes then drain the water fill it again to cover gently stir drain once more then simply fill and drain one last time for a total of two rinses to clean these guys up nicely also if that freaks you out you can also just use all shrimp by now your water should start getting all steamy big chunky pot go ahead and add your sliced lemons be sure to burn vikram by accident oops your rough chopped onions optionally one tablespoon of handashi and one cup of shiradashi which is also optional your garlic five bay leaves then using a paddle if you're a true buy you man give that a gentle stir then add all of your holy boil seasoning give that a thorough stir taste and season it to adjust salt levels if needed oh also don't forget two tablespoons of crystal hot sauce for that extra kaplao once that reaches a rolling boil add 15 whole red potatoes to the pot let that cook for 10 to 15 minutes or till the potatoes are just almost cooked through but not quite yet if you fully cook them they'll be much later once your potatoes are almost ready add in your sausage give that a good stir from there you're going to add two to three pounds of crawfish two clusters of king crab legs two and a half pounds of head-on shrimp these are tiger shrimp again like i said before if you don't want your crawfish you could do all shrimp which would total out to about five to six pounds of shrimp give that a very gentle stir to make sure everything is evenly distributed in your fatty pot optionally you can cover the pot then lightly reduce the temperature and let it gently boil for 10 minutes at this point your entire home should smell like angel tears and as soon as that 10 minutes is up immediately turn off the heat and add your core gently stir once more and let the corn sit for five minutes or until it's nice and hot no mushy corn please i'm sick of it please do it this way now for the moment of truth get yourself an innocent table cover it with butcher paper or newspapers carefully lift up and drain your boil out of its liquid and taking great care dump and spread it all over your table yes this is the only way to do it justice now for your pistol resistance get that lovely butter you made early melted and hot again if needed then smother your incredible boil with it get artistic sling it slang it but be sure to leave a good amount of it on the side for people to get a little ramekin and drizzle it on every bite of goodness then all you need to do is snap crack and pull out some juicy crab doused in butter eat live laugh and stuff yourself until you're physically ill oh and enjoy the famous little man doing a little dance corn potato sausage and i tossed in a little bit of uh these guys who's a little messy it's all good it's all beautiful it's all ready to eat if you've never done this before i highly recommend it whenever the pandemic is finished having its fun you can do this with your family your friends and get together and enjoy a beautiful meal together or you can eat it by yourself there's no one right way to eat this although there is a specific way to eat a crawfish get a crawfish boom there he is looking real cute first off remove the tail all right snap it'll come right out just like that look you got the tail snap that all right pull it off and then i'll get that thing out you don't want the vein that'll pull the vein right out now we have this tail almost ready all right top underside grab the underside on both sides give it a little pull and then the shell peel that off carefully and there you go look it's like a little lobster tail man crawfish little potato a little butter so you know you did a good job when the potatoes are cooked perfectly perfectly not mushy not overcooked they still hold their shape if i squeeze it it breaks but it's fluffy simple concept all right crab leg give a little snap biggest crab segment all right you cut down the top peel it back a little it didn't come out of my piece he's crab butter insane insane what do you want me to say this isn't a butt better but this is better than everything corn cajuns how do we do please in the comments below cajuns if i did terribly please roast me now's your chance if i did great you all owe me a hundred dollars each right feminine will be in the link in the description thank you you want to know what else is full of juicy crab legs buttery dreams and

lot of dishes this is this is for you if you need an extra third rack and you want an easier time washing your dishes you won't be sorry let's talk about this cajun seafood boil big win you can change a lot of variables in this if you want to add other kinds of seafood you absolutely can you want to add a different kind of sausage you absolutely can maybe you add some other vegetables i don't know brussels sprouts whatever you like that is the beauty of a cajun seafood boil it's supposed to bring people together it should make a lot of food it should be relatively simple to make but the flavor should be you know people are always talking about how we don't season our food all right it's time season your food anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave

If you've ever eaten at an American-Chinese restaurant, then you've likely had these before. They're pretty good but we...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, i have a confession i love little cream cheese puff things okay i like them there's no particular restaurant that makes them so it's us versus the world and we're gonna win [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right so crab rangoon it's the crispy wonton filled with cream cheese crab hopefully and green onions all that stuff you might be thinking josh this seems irregular excuse me excuse me if you've ever worked in the back of house at a restaurant and you've gone out after a late night shift after cooking all day what do you want a salad no you want deep fried balls of cream cheese and crab in your mouth over and over until you feel sick to your stomach that's what you want this does not need an introduction so with all that said let's make this shall we we're gonna order this one delivery it just seems right american asian restaurants just have like extraordinarily extensive menus and of course the classic crab rangoon so we're gonna go to the highest rated one in the city the restaurant can't be named because they only have one of them this delivery driver is going to be like this person wanted crab rangoons at 11 in the morning this dude gonna have diarrhea place order 45 minutes 45 bro that's too long so we got the bag i'm actually kind of a fan of crab rangoons it's gonna be hard for me to poop on oh they look kind of good and then they have their sort of like liquid of death blood sauce it's a sweet and sour sauce but you know that this was never touched by a human being a robot made this okay cream cheese literally zero crap where's the crab where is it this is already a huge l how many times have you gone to go get crab rangoon and there's no crap seventy percent of the time we'll just dunk dunk the sack in his blood sauce it's disappointing and good at the same time because obviously this is a nostalgic thing for me but it's also lame just tastes like fry oil wontons and cream cheese this is a sad excuse for something called a crab rangoon you know that we can do much better the first thing we need to discuss is our wontons you can use pre-made stuff or you can make your own if you have any clue where you are believe papa will make his own wonton dough so first thing you need is a medium-sized bowl add in 125 grams of all-purpose flour 20 grams of tapioca starch and 4 grams of fine sea salt whisk that together oh yeah we're using grams only here because accuracy is important for this one separately you're going to need 70 grams of hot hot water mix in 10 grams of vegetable oil then using a fork begin mixing your flour mixture and streaming your oil and water keep mixing until you have a shaggy dough then begin kneading by hand for about a minute or two until you get a nice smooth and supple dough wrap the dough in plastic wrap give it a personality and a respectful name and let it rest for 15 minutes at room temperature now all that's resting we need a sweet chili sauce i'm thinking a sambal gas streak to make that combine half a cup or 100 grams of granulated sugar and half a cup or 120 milliliters of rice vinegar place it on the stove over medium high bring it to a vigorous boil and let that reduce for four minutes or until it begins to turn syrupy the best way to test it is on a clean plate and make sure it pulls a string like this when completely cool now pour that into a bowl cool it down until just barely warm then simply mix in three tablespoons or 35 grams of sambal olek you can find this stuff everywhere nowadays one red fresno chili finely diced a two inch knob of ginger very finely diced more specifically a brunoise and 5 cloves of garlic thinly sliced mix that together and let it sit until completely cool and don't forget to get that nice picky for the gram honey vibes for the peeps ah geez sorry once that's done divide your dough into four pieces and basically you're gonna treat this like fresh pasta press it to get a flat oval then run it through the thickest setting of a pasta roller slowly working your way thinner and thinner until you reach number four or five you definitely want this relatively thin but not so thin that it falls apart or tears once it's looking real nice cut that into manageable segments then using a knife slice those segments into evenly sized squares it's okay if they vary in size a little bit dust each of those pieces generously in tapioca starch and stack on top of each other then repeat with the rest of your dough and just to make sure your dough is good you can always test fry a piece before you wrap if you wish and i mean look at that that looks like a gosh darn wonton dough brother okay let's talk filling the restaurant didn't include crab so we're including the king of crabs uh king crab this guy is actually from tomorrow's video oop whoa we're in the future whoa dude how do you feel anyway you're gonna need half a pound or 225 grams of good quality crab meat ideally king my homies from regala sent me this beautiful whole king crab as a gift they don't paint me to say this stuff but i really do love them there's a link in the description if you want to check them out now once you've got all of your meat give it a nice rough chop then in a separate medium sized bowl add 12 ounces or 350 grams of full fat cream cheese that's softened at room temp poke it a little because it feels nice and it's okay to admit that then using a whisk beat your cream cheese till light and creamy then beat in 2 teaspoons or 12 grams of worcestershire sauce 1 green onion that's been very thinly sliced 2 cloves of garlic freshly grated then using a spatula fold that all together add in your chopped crab that together until thoroughly incorporated now uh papa made him a sticky wiki with this wonton dough and it wasn't dusted enough and it sort of stuck together so uh he had to switch to a pre-made dough for the sake of time obviously my wanton dough is superior but i mean come on look at it anyway line up your wonton squares then using a small cookie scoop or just a spoon place about two to three teaspoons of your filling in the center then brush the edges of each wonton with egg wash that consists of one beaten egg then shaping these is very simple take one side pinch those two edges together repeat with the other side then bring those two points to the center to meet each other pinch and this should create sort of a four winged sort of shape then pinch those edges along the length of the wonton so you create a nice fluted rangoon like this it's very simple here's a little sped up version you see and there you go now i like the shape to look nice and uniform so take your time here make them look beautiful or you can make them look ugly like the store-bought if you're vibing like that whatever now repeat with all of your wontons until you have a beautifully uniform army of rangoons waiting to perish in frying oil to fry simply fill a pot with frying oil at least two inches of depth heat that to 350 fahrenheit or 175 celsius then fry these guys in batches about five to six at a time for three or so minutes or just until crisp and golden don't try to fry too long otherwise the cream cheese will start to boil and split the rangoon that's bad also look how they float like little boats so cute little baby lemen as those finish frying drain them on a wire rack and repeat with the rest of your rangoons in batches now let's plate these up put them on your plate add some of your sambal gas streak give them a little dip and my my my look at it now let's taste test visually i think we know where this is gonna go ball sack or the great pyramids we have fresh king crab in this this is just a ball of cream cheese they'll dip i mean this is just astronomically better you can taste that sweet briny oceanic crabby flavor not cracked the green onion comes through and then you got the richness of the cream cheese the tips are nice and crunchy the bottom it's got a little bit of chew to it it's perfect we did have to resort to the pre-made wontons because papala his wontons sit too long and they got all yucky poopy so don't do that we need a taste test here who's doing it today i think we should do these with sauce on a scale of one said how much sauce do you like i love sauce oh okay you're supposed to just take a bite and you just kind of put the whole thing in your mouth it's kind of gross all right number two why do you eat the whole thing i'm regretting this one yeah it's okay it's fine it's fine see come papa's catchy that was the second one it was terrible yeah that was the first one amazing so many flavors cheese crab this is almost like dessert like comparatively you know what i mean yeah so we have our decision made but better episode i don't literally cannot remember anymore it's impossible but thank you tj for picking the winner yay we did it but better oh you want to know what else is crunchy bursts cream cheese and crab in your mouth and makes you tap dance after consumption b-roll [Music] [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our crab rangoon i mean it was an easy win let's be honest it was a very easy dub using king crab i think is a bit of a leg up obviously even with imitation crab we still would have won having that extra flavor taking the care to make your own wontons even though papa kinda forgot about it whatever doesn't matter this is yet another reason why making it from scratch and making it exactly how you want it to taste will always be the best version of whatever it is that you make assuming that you're like you know how to season stuff properly the main point is if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see

Crispy homemade french fries covered in a rich beef gravy, cheese, and well... that's all you need....",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, french fries are nearly a perfect food on the side but this canadian tradition turns it into arguably one of the best meals of all time okay so today we are making poutine or putin poutine putin shout out to all the canadian homies papa love you so much papa love everybody but papa love you right now especially we're making this amazing dish the traditional version is literally french fries cheese curds and gravy it sounds like some sort of stoners midnight dream and it essentially is with all that said we're gonna make two versions one traditional one fancy let's make this shall we okay there are three pieces here first we'll make the crispy crunchy fries then mr traditional and end it all a fancy boy version for the fries you're gonna need two pounds of russet potatoes peeling them as unnecessary then cut them into batons to save my self-time i got this french fry cutter which is quite extra unnecessary and also highly recommended link in description for that once you have your batons cover those with cold water and soak for 20 minutes i like to add a little ice to mine to help chill them then after soaking drain the water out then rinse and drain three more times until the water is clear on their final drain remove them and place them on towels until dry separately in a heavy bottom pot heat two and a half inches of fry oil to 325 fahrenheit then fry your dry fries that's a tongue twister in batches for only two to three minutes you don't want any color instead you want them just cooked through blistered and creamy looking drain your fries on a wire rack and repeat with the rest once all of your fries are par fried turn the heat of your oil up so it reaches 355 fahrenheit then again fry in batches this time only for about one to three minutes or until golden brown and nice and crispy remove them season them with salt immediately and drain on a wire rack french fries now hold on one note you're gonna want to do that second fry there after you've made your gravy so they don't get soft while you do all that anyway speaking of making gravy to do the traditional version start with a quarter cup of unsalted butter in a medium saucepan set that to medium heat and once the butter is melted in bubbling add two small shallots that have been minced three cloves of minced garlic let that saute for about a minute or till softened then add a quarter cup of all-purpose flour stir that around and let that cook for about two minutes or until the roux begins to reach a nutty brown color from there you're gonna mix in half a cup of a nice beer this is a good old-fashioned canadian beer for the respect followed by three cups of beef stock and one tablespoon of worcestershire sauce give that a stir and continue heating until thickened and beautifully glossy season that the taste of salt and pepper and voila a beautiful gravy make sure your beef stock is primo because 80 of its flavor will come from that you don't want to make papa mad do you now at this point you would do the second fry for your fries get yourself a plate add your crispy hot fries layer on some good old-fashioned proper cheese curds hit it with a fat ladle of your hot gravy and honestly a little sacrilegious some thin sliced chives now let us taste test poutine we have it right here now let's talk about crispiness really quick not crisp fry them as crunchy as possible serve immediately the longer it sits the soggier it gets that's why all the poutines you get are soggy doesn't matter let's talk about this this is right this is everything right in the world it's perfect it is literally perfect this is a perfect poutine the gravy is not too rich it's just right it's beefy it's anxious it's got umami and yet it also somehow cuts through the richness in a way there's a certain level of acidity that just feels right it's it's poutine and it's going to make me poo a traditional poutine grape but what about a fancy okay next up is our poutine with mornay and fried salami the fancy version start with a nice salami or soprasada like a single link i actually used a mix between soprasada and truffle salami now cut that into half inch cubes that are relatively even in size heat a medium sized skillet over medium high heat coat the pan lightly with olive oil then once that's nice and hot add your salami and cook tossing occasionally until crispy and lightly brown on all sides about four minutes drain out the fat and set your crispy meat stuff to the side now for the morning sauce start by heating three tablespoons of unsalted butter over medium heat in a medium saucepan now once that's melted whisk in three tablespoons of all-purpose flour let that cook whisking occasionally for 30 seconds then whisk in three cups of whole milk again let that heat and cook whisking occasionally until thickened beautiful and uh yemen then add one and a half cups of fresh grated gruyere cheese whisk that all together until smooth and glossy remove from the heat season to taste with salt hit it with two cloves of fresh grated garlic a light grating of nutmeg and finally some fresh ground black pepper give that a little taste go to heaven come back and move on with the rest of the recipe now the last thing is our cheese curds instead of using a civilian room temp cheese curd i thought it'd be a whole lot cooler to do a pan-fried scamorza so get yourself a whole bowl of samorza cut it in half remove its waxy layer then cut those halves in half so you get quarters then cut those quarters into three quarters of an inch wedges so they look something like this now heat up a medium-sized non-stick skillet over medium-high then once that's absolutely screaming hot adding your skimorza in one layer and let that sear for about one minute or until nice and browned then quickly flip all the pieces and repeat on the other side try to avoid completely melting these otherwise it gets really messy now transfer those to a plate or a quarter sheet tray and repeat with the rest of your skimorza to create brown crispy cheesy goodness now to assemble this second fry your french fries get them nice and beautifully crispy so even your friends from across the country can hear the crunch then lay those in a nice bowl top it with as many pieces of samorza as your heart desires hit it with a generous layer of your hot and creamy mornay sauce a nice handful of fried salami a fatty grating of parmesan or reggiano a handful of sliced chives and finally garnish beautifully with some flat leaf italian parsley because curly leaf is pure evil now that is a beautifully transformed poutine canadians what do you think i can tell you what we thought right here in this taste test wow i caught the wrong side that's okay though pan-fried skewers the cheese fried salami fried sopressata and you've got the fries and a garlic mornay sauce i was thinking about putting gochujang in the morning honestly it's a little bit overkill but get some fry sauce and skamorzo here we go it's like a thousand calories in one bite oh my god my diet please dear god for a second i forgot both of you guys were there genuinely that happened completely naturally i don't know if i can ever go back to a normal poutine why isn't there more more nasa's poutine although it's rich it plays really well with the french fries there's still a little bit of sweetness from the bechamel because bechamel isn't like super rich kind of got a sweetness from the milk it all makes sense coming together it just makes sense tj i'd like you to enter the frame since you've had poutine before oh now you tell me that i had poopy on my chin how long has it been poopy on my chin violation like the poutine that i ate years ago was really good i remember it had bacon bits on it this fried salami that blows it out salami lid what the hell else do you want us to say it's freaking good if you've never had it before you've never been to canada by the way shout out to all my canadian homies like maddie matheson this one's for you you want to know what else rhymes with poutine and makes your eyes roll in the back of your head [Music] b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our poutine putin this was one of my most favorite executions of a recipe it tasted like it should the traditional version and then that fancy version it wasn't too much of a stray away from the heart and essence of this dish there was obviously a more sophisticated flavor to it and i was very happy with that now i'm gonna take my shiny forehead and go make more food and stuff like that i think anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music]

Although those budget busters can be delicious, how about we make those...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, [Music] on valentine's day or even a date night you don't want to spend a ton of money on desserts you just want to relax and maybe spend this much that is but cheaper [Music] okay so we're doing date night valentine's day night desserts whatever you want to call it it is for your loved one whether they're a significant other or it could it could be for your mom the point is we want to have a special occasion dessert it's oftentimes expensive we're here to make it not expensive more specifically three different kinds one for this price one for this price and one for this price the one other thing i do want to mention is all three of these are extremely easy to make all right it's simple ingredients cooked very quickly to make something beautiful and delicious now with all that said let's make this shall we okay we got three tiers of cheap and easy ultra easy that's the chocolate one medium easy that's the creme brulee in the most labor intensive but also easy that's the rice pudding let's start with the easiest a velvety chalky mousse in literally two minutes and when i say chalky i mean chocolate for those who don't browse tick tock too much so in a food processor add two cups or 450 grams of ricotta let that process on high until smooth then once smooth continue processing and gradually add three tablespoons or 42 grams of granulated sugar followed by a small pinch of salt then stream in four ounces of melted semi-sweet chocolate continue to process you may have to scrape down the sides just to get it loosened then once it's thoroughly incorporated and velvety that's it i mean look at how gorgeous this moose is i genuinely was pretty shocked at how well this turned out anyway let's really play up the fancy look to this grab a very large spoon i mean a real big boy get a big scoop and let it naturally fall off the spoon and drape over itself in a shallow bowl creating a light quinelle shape then grate some extra chocolate on top of that and finally a nice little scoop of ice cream i used a small ball shape because i thought it looked cute but obviously you could go bigger and optionally hit the ice cream with some fresh grated nutmeg i'm not counting that against the cost okay so now look at this glossy man standing so proud and at this price right here for the whole thing and with up to four servings it's really this much per serving okay next up we're gonna make a creme brulee yeah who would have thought creme brulee would make the butt cheaper cut first start by cracking five eggs into a small bowl separate out the yolks and place those golden boys into a medium sized bowl save the egg whites for i don't know a meringue or a sad egg white omelet in a small saucepan add two cups or 475 milliliters of heavy whipping cream along with a half teaspoon or four grams of sea salt and 2 teaspoons or 6 grams of vanilla extract for the record vanilla bean is way better but you know this is but cheaper mix it together and whisk over medium heat until hot and steamy but not boiling now while that's heating using electric beaters or a strong arm and a whisk begin beating your egg yolks then gradually add half a cup or 100 grams of granulated sugar a little splash at a time while continuously beating until all of it is added by the end it should be lightened in color and a little bit thicker like you see here now once your cream is hot whisk in a little splash into your egg yolks stir that in mix it a little more and keep doing that just until your yolks are hot then pour the yolk mixture back into the cream mix together until thoroughly combined and pour into a bowl through a mesh sieve now to avoid too many foam bubbles i like to use a skimmer to skim off any excess foam from the top layer of your creme brulee base this next part is real easy get four six ounce ramekins place them in a baking dish then evenly divide your creme brulee base amongst the four ramekins then pour in enough boiling water around the ramekins not in them to come up about three quarters of the way up the ramekin then gently place that in an oven set to 325 fahrenheit for 30 to 40 minutes or just until set but still jiggly pull those guys out of the oven out of their hot water bath and let them cool in a wire rack until completely cool now once they're room temperature i don't know why that's stupid wrap them in plastic wrap and pop them in the fridge to set and chill for at least four hours and ideally overnight look these are really easy to make and i would recommend doing it the night before because then you just pull them out and yeah now once you're ready to serve give the tops a light sprinkling with granulated sugar and brush with a kitchen torch or pop them under your boiler until the sugar is caramelized with a light bit of char here and there now let that cool till glassy crack and enjoy a nostalgic moment for this price right here all right next up is one of the fanciest rice puddings you've ever seen start with a medium sized sauce pot and add one cup or 220 grams of arborio rice yes the same kind for risotto followed by half a cup plus three tablespoons or 125 grams of granulated sugar then pour in four and a half cups or one liter of whole milk half a cup or 120 milliliters of heavy whipping cream one teaspoon or four grams of vanilla extract and finally one cinnamon stick but wait god dang it josh getting ahead of yourself here pro tip give this guy a nice light char with either a kitchen torch or under your broiler until it looks like this then add it to your pot set that on the stove over medium high stirring often and as soon as it comes to a rapid simmer immediately reduce the heat to medium low then let that simmer cook and thicken stirring occasionally for about 20 to 25 minutes or until the rice is tender and thickened like this please no undercooked rice pour that into a bowl cover with plastic and let it sit in the fridge until cool or room temp or however you like it some people like it hot i prefer cold once you pull it out it may have thickened a little bit so feel free to add a little more milk or cream to help loosen it so it's a little closer to a risotto consistency now before we plate this up get one to two large bananas peel them essentially in front of your lover this valentine's day cut them in half lengthwise so they look like this and place them on a foil lined baking sheet sprinkle the cut ends with sugar to coat completely and yet again either torch them with a kitchen torch or place them under a broiler until they are beautifully caramelized and glassy now to plate this up put a big dollop of rice pudding in the center of a nice plate tap the plate on the bottom to get it flat and shake it to get a nice relatively even circle then gently place on your caramelized banana artfully of course attention to detail homies now follow that up with a nice line of about one to two tablespoons of crushed pistachios in an optional light dusting of ground cinnamon i mean look at that childhood memories with a little bit more finesse and a very fair price of this guy right here now let us taste test this with our lady friend of the evening or well of every evening she's gonna get mad at me a butt cheaper combined with a valentine's dessert menu you've got three choices here for this price for that price and for this price boom that's pretty good collectively you could do all of these for a grand total of becca right here i don't think i can do this without a taste tester specifically a significant other catherine please enter the frame hi okay i want you to taste this and then guess how much you think it costs to make it manufactured by joshua weissman oh that's good i like the banana is it caramelized is that the word yes yes it is yeah that's right how much do you think this costs 30 i actually don't know yet because we haven't calculated it but it's this much after we calculated it i feel like whoa that's a big difference i hope do you know what this is grandpa get a little bit oh you did okay oh that's grab i like the crunchy sugar at the top i haven't even tried this one yet it's good that's my words it's creamy it's rich it's got the classic creme brulee flavor that you love and that caramelized sugar just brings it all together brother so guess on the price for to make that eighteen dollars eighteen dollars well it's actually chocolate mousse now eat that and tell me how much you think it is tomorrow's really good tastes like dark chocolate cream it's rich rich chocolatey dark dark i think this would be 18 the price is this much i actually haven't tried this yet this is my first time making this recipe this hits if you're a chocolate mousse person this is the recipe for you this is just as rich just as velvety creamy and it has a nice volume to it it's anxious there's weight there's magnitude to this moose you want to know what else would make both yourself and your date weak in the knees b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so but cheaper episode i genuinely have not a single clue out of these three desserts i think i have one specific favorite and that is the rice pudding i've always wanted to do a fancier rice pudding do i think this is as fancy as i can make it absolutely not no not even close but it is a little more upscale for the average home cook now the creme brulee is creme brulee it's not really that different of a recipe just most people don't know that it's really cheap to make and then of course there's the chocolate mousse which looks a little bit like poopy but that's okay because it's yummy and that's all i have to say about that so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time i can't stop thinking about poopy now that's

This sandwich is easily one of the most iconic and...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, somebody might think this is too easy of a recipe but i say nay we must look deeper we're gonna make everything from scratch everything [Music] okay so today we're making a peanut butter and jelly but not really it's not just about the peanut butter and jelly as it is of course we have our childhood nostalgia especially if you're from america you're gonna know the peanut butter and jelly very very well my simple argument is is it better when you make absolutely everything from scratch from the bread to the jelly to the peanut butter does it make a big difference or is it not really worth it i think it's gonna be better but we're here to put this conversation to rest and my mom is here to help us so with all that said let's make this shall we all righty teddy folks uh all right yeah let's not start with that we have three major elements here the bread obviously the butter of peanuts and the jelly well in this case we're using jam peanut butter and jam sandwich peanut butter and fruit spread sandwich i don't know i just want something more general sounding anyway let's begin with our bread this is the exact same recipe that's in my store bought sandwich bread video so if you want it broken down in more depth the link is in the description but i'll give you a quick low down anyway start with 175 milliliters of water to that you're going to add 125 milliliters of whole milk heat that to 95 fahrenheit then mix in 9 grams of instant yeast let it sit combine your 440 grams of bread flour 8 grams of fine sea salt and 21 grams of granulated sugar whisk that together pop it on your stand mixer begin mixing then add your yeast juice mix that to elastic and finally add 42 grams of softened unsalted butter until fully incorporated and you get a smooth supple dough spank it a little obviously then you cover it give it a name worthy of respect and adoration then let it rise until doubled then punch its hopes and dreams down dump it on a lightly floured work surface roll into a nice rectangle then roll that rectangle into a nice long voluptuous tube is voluptuous the right word here and please into a greased loaf pan then cover it with a damp towel let it proof till doubled and finally pop it into an oven set the 350 fahrenheit or 175 celsius for 35 to 40 minutes or until you get a beautiful little man like this now pop them out and let it cool in a wire rack on its side actually don't think i mentioned that in the original video but resting on its side helps keep the top nice and domed now let's get into our peanut butter this is yet another thing where you go oh my gosh is it really that easy that's all it takes yes so start off with two and a half cups or 375 grams of raw peanuts these spanish ones have their skins which are super annoying but that's fine toss them onto a baking sheet and then into an oven set to 350 fahrenheit or 175 celsius for about 12 minutes or until they're nice and deeply toasted be careful not to burn them if that wasn't obvious already once they're done pull them out and if they do still have their skins place them in a clean dish towel rub your nuts together until all their skins come off now place your skinless hot nuts to the side to cool completely once cool add them to a food processor and begin processing on high speed now look let them grind don't mess with it now if it does cake up on the side you can always scrape down with a spatula and continue grinding the grind never stops alright first it'll get crumbly then it'll start to ball up do a little dance and finally it will become more liquid and at this point you should add about a half teaspoon or five grams of fine sea salt then once it reaches the appropriate peanut buttery consistency that's it that's your peanut butter now pour that into a bowl or an airtight container and leave it covered at room temp and use when desired okay next up is an ultra simple strawberry jam i know it's not technically jelly but purists can step right the [ __ ] off start with 2 pounds or 900 grams of fresh strawberries cut all those tops off line them up like an armada of now if they're extra chunky you can quarter them otherwise have all of your strawberries then place them in a medium sauce pot along with three cups or 550 grams of granulated sugar stir those until thoroughly incorporated and let them sit and macerate remember that's macerate don't be nasty for about 10 minutes then using a potato masher crush your strawberries as best as you can then place them on the stove over medium high heat bring to a boil and let those bad boys boil for around 8 to 10 minutes stirring occasionally until thickened and jammy you can also put a little on a plate to cool to make sure it's jammy enough this is much more loose when it's hot versus when it's cold so be sure to account for that when reducing then just cool in a bowl set over an ice bath until cold now the moment of truth our most difficult plating assembly we've seen to date first slice your bread lovingly and beautifully next get two of those slices and on one side hit it with your peanut butter to your heart's desire and of course on the other the confitio aka strawberry jam uh my french audience is probably not super happy with that place the jam side on top of the peanut side slice on the diagonal because it always tastes better that way and let us begin our taste test okay so we've made it to our final destination homemade everything jam peanut butter bread all coming together i still think this is better but there's a nostalgia factor that's kind of missing if you're looking for that ultra almost commercial level softness you're not gonna get that with this bread just straight up but the flavors are there with toasty peanut butter that rich intense strawberry flavor to me this is a winner but we have a special taste tester to ring it in my mom i will hand feed you number one number two so one i don't know josh you don't know there's no wrong answer this is number one this is number two number two you number two's mine boys i can't believe we lost this one no we did all this work for nothing no point to doing this at all one thing i do want to note really quick so the store-bought bread absorbs nothing at all so you can literally still see the jam and the peanut butter now on my bread it actually absorbed all of the peanut butter and all the jam so if you're going to be saucing this or jamming this make sure to put extra otherwise you're going to lose to the damn store that's it you want to know what else was a faulty tasting we will absolutely be revisiting the peanut butter and jelly [Music] b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made the peanut butter and jelly look let me take a step back really quick mom it's okay it's okay it's okay it's so funny to me because we make all these crazy things and i've worked in professional restaurants where it takes months just to get something on the plate and so it's funny whenever we do these ridiculously basic foods and then we're just like stumped i think at the end of the day when you make your own jelly you make your own peanut butter those flavors are gonna be good but the one thing that's tough to beat is that sort of commercial soft quality to the bread i would even argue that we needed to use a different kind of bread in this recipe and i definitely think we would have easily won this because the flavor was superior the jelly was superior but that bread maybe a brioche would have been better i don't know try some different breads for me at the very least okay you could do me that much but anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned

I'm not really sure but Burger King has set this work out for us and I...,2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, yeah you know i love french fries but chicken fries what okay it doesn't matter because we're going to flex on them [Music] [Applause] [Music] anyway [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today we're doing our very first butt better with burger king i don't know about the king of burgers their chicken fries were the most requested out of everything that i saw and i get why they're kind of weird and unique and i don't know i don't like the concept of a chicken fry it's like at that point just make fried chicken like you don't have to go through all that you just don't i guess it's cool because you can put it in your mouth like that but but even then like no no i don't want this to be the whole dialogue so with all that said let's just make this shall we kirkerby can i get two orders of the chicken fries can i also get sauce with it we don't have a special sauce for it we just have like 50 barbecue rack i'll do it without the sauce then you don't have fry sauce how could you have chicken fries without the fry sauce it's okay it's okay papa papa will take care thank you so we've got the bag this is our first burger king isn't that i think it is oh it's like a modern art burger you didn't have to do all that all right the box kind of like it i dig it all cluck you tweet what god there's a lot of stuff on this hashtag chicken fries hitchhike yeah we all do hashtags right welcome to 2007 when instagram was launched kind of look like skinny mozzarella sticks but uglier they didn't have any sauce so this is sauceless oh i mean listen listen to how these these snap first off that sounds like a tore piece of foam in half the aftertaste is super bitter because the oil's been on for god knows how long um but they do taste okay aside from that like the the msg helps so there's that they're not quite juicy considering there should be plenty of fat in this the mcdonald's nuggets are better than this these are these just have clout because they're in the shape of a fry oh we oh we're yeah we're gonna we're gonna do better that if that wasn't evident well well well this is kind of a similar thing to the mcdonald's nuggets in the sense of ground chicken but before we go there let's first make our chicken fry sauce since bk underwhelmed us by not even having it get yourself a medium saucepan and add half a cup of ketchup three tablespoons of worcestershire sauce two and a half tablespoons of dark brown sugar two teaspoons of garlic powder one and a half teaspoons of fine sea salt one tablespoon of white vinegar and two tablespoons of honey optionally give it a little sprinkle of magic dust also known as msg and lastly a tablespoon of your favorite hot sauce give that a stir place it on a stove over medium heat and as soon as it starts to bubble let that simmer and reduce for eight minutes while stirring occasionally then what's that look like to you that's a good old-fashioned barbecue sauce kind of but hang on pour that bad boy into a small bowl and add half a cup of yellow mustard half a cup of mayonnaise yes i know there's a lot of ingredients right just stop complaining if you're not then papa kiss you oh uh one last thing i also added some spicy chili crisp because you know why not there's already like 10 ingredients about a tablespoon anyways give that some whiskey business until thoroughly combined and marvel at a king of chicken sauces now what exactly makes up a chicken fry chickens mating with fries fries manning with chickens it all sounds very wrong and cryptic instead we must first begin with ground chicken i'd recommend grinding your own which if you choose to do so get yourself one pound of chicken breast slice it into nice long strips place it into a bowl then rough chop a quarter pound of pure chicken skin which you can buy from a butcher or strip off some chicken thighs you know those chicken thighs you forgot in your fridge that you're just letting them sit there and rot away make sure they're not actually rotting to that you're gonna add two teaspoons of garlic powder three quarters of a teaspoon of msg two teaspoons of kosher salt one teaspoon of ground white pepper and one teaspoon of granulated sugar now mix all that up prep a meat grinder and look i've said it before if you have a stand mixer get the meat grinder attachment it's like 40 bucks and it's incredible for stuff like this i use it all the time anyway run your meat through your grinder gradually until all of it is ground and just look at that it's perfectly ground chicken and of course if you don't have a grinder simply buy pure ground chicken breast and skip the skin okay so we have our spice ground chicken now all we need to do is shape it using a bowl of water dampen your hands to keep the meat from sticking and form your chicken into the dimensions of well a french fry yes literally a french fry what were you expecting go as thick or thin as you want although i found a little under a half inch thick to be perfect the length is up to you but try not to get too crazy because nobody here wants to measure that this takes some time so just be patient and become one with your chicken now once you've got your meat sticks pop those thangs in the freezer for 15 minutes now while those are firming up get your katsu style breading station ready here we have a bowl filled with one cup of all-purpose flour which i've also seasoned with two teaspoons of garlic powder one teaspoon of msg two teaspoons of spanish paprika and two teaspoons of kosher salt the next bowl is two to three eggs cracked and beaten with one tablespoon of water until homogeneous and lastly 1 cup of panko bread crumbs ok it's breading time first begin by gently coating your fries evenly with the flour mixture shake off the excess then give it a complete coat with egg wash make sure there's no dry spots and finally toss in the panko for a beautifully even coat remember papa's rule no naked chicken spots i want this thing to be a full and single absolute unit of coating do you go outside with your jacket and pants but then cut the backside off your pants so that your butt cheeks are revealed no so don't do it with your chicken anyway frying these is super easy get a heavy bottom pot filled about three quarters of the way up with oil for frying of course heat that to 350 degrees fahrenheit over medium heat and then fry your breaded chicken in batches of five to eight pieces at a time depending on the pot for about three to four minutes or until they emerge transformed glowing golden brown and in an ethereal state of crispiness that could send you to the okay okay let's just taste test this and see how we did nobody needs water what most people need that is canned water that was a terrible idea we've got our chicken fries the simple idea of a chicken fry bothers me to the very core of my culinary being so we won't focus too much on that and rather i think we should just eat this shall we rather than saying we won let's just take a listen you got it the salt levels the seasoning the crunch the texture of the chicken is bouncy it's juicy they may not have had their sauce but i made something that i thought would go good with it cut the cameras this is the perfect combo it's sweet and mustardy rich it has a little bit of spice from the spicy chili crisp by the way shout out to spicy chili crisp solves all problems look you guys know i think we won let's bring vickerman here today's test he hasn't eaten at all today he's just been sitting here starving to death he puts on the coveted bug better master but i'm gonna do just plain chain or something dude plain jane number one oh wait number one and number two hold it like a cigarette blow always blow when you have a cigarette i mean yours is number one number one is the clear winner no question about it texture taste do you see the bitter aftertaste i'm talking about yeah normally i don't know what you're talking about with the bitterness like i i'm used to fast food so i don't really taste it but this is definitely bitter ahem oh congratulations you win all right you heard it here but better episode 32 i think i'm not very good at counting but i am very good at cooking see you next time you want to know what else is full of crispy meaty rods dunked into a creamy sauce b-roll alright guys and that is it so we made chicken fries as in fried chicken in the form of a french fry but not a french fry because there's no potatoes so it's really just chicken fries okay ah ah i can't let go this problem that i have with this i was actually kind of surprised because it turned out much better than i had anticipated not just in the sense of it being good but more so like i kind of like the idea of a katsu style chicken cylinder it's actually kind of a great idea taking a step back you should definitely make this i don't regret it whatsoever granted shaping those little tubes took a little time but nonetheless worth the effort you need to make it and with all that said if you enjoyed this

It's incredibly simple, can be made in a typical college dorm room, and is done in just a few minutes....",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, josh i'm a college student i can't afford this and make that well that's what this stew is for it has class in history it costs this much and it utilizes the dietary composition of a college student that is but cheaper [Music] okay now listen up this isn't just about college students obviously i just wanted to use that as a caveat to the point that it utilizes two of the main sort of dietary choices of a college student that would be american cheese and ramen noodles there you go you see this is a dish that was created during wartime amazing flavors emerged they utilized what they had and what those things were were like spam hot dogs ramen american cheese it almost feels like a college student meal and it's cheap and this is but cheaper so uh let's make this shall we i'm gonna make this very simple follow this recipe first but understand that many of these beautiful ingredients can be changed to suit your wallet or preference it's very much of a use what you've got soup let's start by making our soup base combine two tablespoons or 35 grams of gochujang find this stuff at most grocery stores one tablespoon or 15 milliliters of white distilled vinegar one tablespoon or 15 milliliters of soy sauce a small splash oop big splash of shiradashi which is totally optional by the way finally chop 4 cloves of peeled garlic whisk together your base then stir in your garlic along with 2 teaspoons or 10 grams of granulated sugar and an optional 2.5 teaspoons or 10 grams of korean chili flakes mostly for color mix it together and that's your base now here we have some lovely dried shiitake mushrooms get two ounces or 55 grams of those guys place them in a medium sized bowl add one and a half cups or 350 milliliters of filtered water to a saucepan bring it up to a boil and then pour that hot liquid all over your mushrooms cover so they're completely submerged then let them sit and rehydrate for about 12 minutes or till soft cuddly and sweet or just soft then remove them from the liquid wring them out so the liquid falls back into the mushroom stock that you just made remove their stems and slice them up nice and evenly set to the side now let's talk about our mate alright you can use really enemy but to keep things consistent with this dish's history you'll need one cam of spam yes spam wield its power with honor and half a pound or 55 grams of smoked sausage like andouille slice the spam into slices they're about half an inch thick do the same with your sausage although i like to cut on a slight bias so you get some sort of nice diagonal shapes get yourself a large pot or a deep braiser heat it over medium-high heat until ripping hot and yes notice how the surface is drier than the mojave well that's cool because our spam will render out its own fat so toss your spam in sear it in a single layer for about two to three minutes or until nicely browned flip and sear for the same amount of time repeat with the rest of your spam making sure not to overcrowd the pan then once that's done sear your sausage in the same way let it get color for two to three minutes flip and sear the other side you get the point now that we have our brown meats looking juicy and loosey-goosey we're ready to finish this thing there should be plenty of oil in the pan but if not add a little bit to coat the bottom reduce the heat to medium then add one bunch of green onions that have been thinly sliced half a pound or 225 grams of button mushrooms which have also been thinly sliced observe the speed thank you so much let those saute for a minute or two then add three quarters of a cup 125 grams of kimchi that's been roughly chopped nicely stir that in and let it saute for another minute now as soon as the mushrooms begin to soften add in your sauce base you made earlier let that cook stirring occasionally for about two minutes or until the bottom of the pan begins to dry a little bit then from there add three cups or 700 milliliters of chicken stock your mushroom stock from earlier give it a stir with a spoon scraping off any extra bits left at the bottom turn the heat to medium-high bring it up to a boil then immediately reduce to low and let that lightly simmer for about two minutes or just until the mushrooms are cooked through now this is where things get interesting you'll need two packages of instant ramen noodles pick your favorite you know it's up to you i like the ones with the little round pucks just cute you know save your flavor packet for something else i don't know pour it on your popcorn thank me later we only want those sweet nudes my dudes while that's simmering slowly lower in your noodles get them pressed and lightly submerged in the soup top it with lid and let that cook for three to four minutes or whatever the package directions say to cook said nudes once they're cooked through take off your lid and make this thing look beautiful by first arranging on your beautiful seared spam some of that sliced smoky sausage your rehydrated shiitake mushrooms get creative about the placement of this stuff it should be fun now the piece de resistance you ready for this two slices of american cheese yes this is tradition for this dish you can exclude it but i'm telling you it really makes the soup in no other circumstance would papa allow this anyway top it with your lid again and let it very gently simmer for another two minutes or until the meats are hot and the cheese is melted once that's done remove from the heat hit it with a generous amount of very thinly sliced green onions and serve immediately now if you've never had this before prepare for one of the greatest soup experiences of your life i'm talking eyes rolling in the back of the head you're sweating because you're eating so fast type good don't believe me observe wow this is just an incredible thing is it not i mean look at this look at this look at it you might be thinking uh chicken stocking a little gochujang and you throw stuff together how could it taste right [Music] i'm tired of the whole like people taking their instant ramen boiling it's the stupid little flavor pack i understand it's effort this there's a reward when it comes to effort this is low effort it's incredibly flavorful rich umami fatty soul warming and it has history and it's cheap i think you get where i'm going and that is the butt cheaper route you want to know what else contains steamy nudes and salty spam b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our korean army stew amazing the flavor's intense it almost has like that hearty rich slightly spicy asian flavor that we all yearn to taste yet there's these other influences that come in and make it something even more special despite how cheap they are like i said before we're not limiting ourselves to having to be a college student to make this everyone should make this but if you are a college student this is for you stop complaining make this every day and love life so with all that said if you

the world praise this dish that and also you can stuff it with cheese and deep fry it so [Music] okay so today we are making risotto not just any risotto but the most basic yet proper way that we possibly can not gonna over complicate it we're just gonna look at the basic flavors put them together and take our hand give it the love that it deserves and then when we're done with it i'm gonna show you what to do with the leftovers which if you can already tell it has to do with deep frying and cheese pulls and all that good stuff so with all that said let's make this shall we okay risotto can either be extremely simple or unnecessarily complicated so let's choose the the good one first off quick note make sure to cut your vegetables nice and small so here you'll need one to two shots which will be peeled sliced in half and very finely diced like this i like it where they almost disappear in the risotto same thing with the three cloves of garlic except i just very finely mince mine now in a medium sauce pot add four and a half cups of chicken stock place it on the stove over medium high heat and bring it up to a boil as soon as it reaches a boil turn off the heat and just leave it there so it's nice and hot ready for use guys keep it simple just keep the darn freaking chicken juice hot all right next get a medium sort of large-ish saucepan heat two to three tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat until shimmering then add your shallots and garlic season with salt and saute that for about three to four minutes or just until the vegetables begin to soften add one and a half cups of arborio rice yes i use arborio oh my gosh josh what about carnaroli well how about you just okay anyway toast the rice for about 30 seconds stirring often then add half a cup of white wine and a pinch of saffron threads that have been lightly crushed turn the heat up to medium-high and boil that until it's about 90 evaporated then turn the heat back down to medium now this is the moment of truth that everyone gets all freaked out about man your gosh darn stations you got your base you have your hot chicken stock now begin by constantly stirring your base add a nice half cup ladle full of your hot chicken stock and as i said constantly stir do not stop stirring look guys breathe relax just get a nice glass of wine or sparkling grape juice if you roll like that play some nice music and do not stop stirring doesn't have to be vigorous don't death grip the spoon just relax your hand and stir without stopping as soon as that liquid has been absorbed by the rice add yet another half cup ladle full of your chicken stock keep on stirring tap dancing to jazz and dreaming about your future then just rinse and repeat that process by adding stock stir stir until it absorbs add more stock and keep on doing that until the rice is cooked to an al dente and no crunch is left now once it's done please ensure that the consistency is not too dry i'm tired of seeing weird over-absorbed risotto should be like the rice is suspended in a thick custard that holds it all together but not runny necessarily once your beauty is done turn off the heat and stir in two tablespoons of unsalted butter until fully melted and emulsified and a third cup of grated grana pidano or parmigiano cheese once that's done add a thick mound of your risotto in the center of a flat plate give it a few taps on the palm of your hand to get a nice even relatively round circle on your plate hit it with some additional grated parmigiano-reggiano then fresh cracked black pepper and look if you're feeling mad luxurious you can also add a hefty drizzle of aged balsamic vinegar this one is a truffle balsamic from da boys at regalis now let's taste test this so we have a saffron risotto i actually uh started to run out of stock and i used a little bit of ramen that was in the fridge and i gotta say i'm already excited about that finish it with a little bit of black truffle balsamic from our friends at regalis uh shout out to them by the way that's not sponsored okay stop saying it is they're just homies and they send me stuff because we're homies anyway oh my god oh my god this is ridiculous this embodies what every human heart desires during the winter times and yet there's a quality of luxury to it yeah i don't really have much to say then this is a perfect food this is the simplest way to make it you can add all sorts of flavors to it but this is the baseline you want it doesn't just stop here what do you do with leftovers of risotto long story short it ends with cheesy fried balls so let's do that okay we have a risotto but let's talk about arancini orangini one of the two also known as fried risotto balls filled with melty cheese and dreams to make these you either gonna have to have leftover risotto otherwise you'll have to make a new batch specifically for this recipe which is completely worth it and i recommend it now spread that all over silpat or parchment set on a baking sheet cover it with plastic wrap and let that chill in the fridge for at least one hour or up to overnight once it's nice and firmed up get some of your solidified risotto shape it into balls that are about two inches thick and then flatten them into a nice thick patty then repeat that with all of your risotto and try to keep those balls even then get some low moisture mozzarella and cut it into three quarter inch cubes again keep them even just like your balls take a risotto patty place a cube of mozzarella that's for the new yorkers out there in the center and gently wrap the edges around and crimp it shut so you have a ball with no exposed cheese whatsoever and do that with all of your risotto patties now these guys are gonna get breaded katsu style which is very simple one and a half cups of all-purpose flour in one bowl two to three eggs beaten in another bowl and a package of panko bread crumbs in the final third bowl now run down your station in this order first coat every last inch of the ball in flour shake off the excess toss the coat fully in the egg wash and last toss in the panko breadcrumbs so you get a nice crumbed up looking ball geez that sounds gross but it's really a good thing once you're done and all of your balls are nice and evenly breaded heat up a pot filled with about two and a half inches of oil that's fry oil like vegetable oil or something like that once it reaches 350 fahrenheit add about three to four risotto balls at a time do a nice little dance and let that fry for six to eight minutes or until a deep golden brown fish them out of the oil with a spider and drain them on a wire rack set over a baking sheet then fry the rest of your balls and those are your beautiful get ready for this aren't you how did you do huh italians all right that was disrespectful i'm sorry serve these bad boys with a nice marinara or tomato sauce of your choice and let's see that cheese pull oh yes yum yum papa want in his tum tum anyway let's taste this it is time for the key [Music] it's literally just fried risotto balls stuffed with cheese and you just give it a little dunk oh my god look i've had orangini before so it's no surprise to me how freaking amazing this is it's crispy and crunchy on the outside creamy on the inside you've got that beautiful risotto which if you spent a long time on the love will reflect in this and it's all brought together by the tomato sauce that's all i have to say so i think we need an opinion from somebody who's never had one before [Applause] first impression is um wow it's like one of those things where there's like what do you even say i don't think i can say anything except just continue eating and y'all need to make this with that said risotto two different ways you've got the basic risotto you gotta have that skill set you can't skip that as a cook ever and then you have what to do with the leftover risotto there's no other way around it you gotta make that goodbye you wanna know what else has both creamy stuff and crispy balls in it b-roll [Music] [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our risotto two different ways well really one way and then we use the leftovers but the point is this is such a versatile dish it's not just like oh you got some rice and some stock in your no you can use different kinds of liquids it doesn't have to be chicken stock it could be beef stock it could be a ramen base it could be far broth you do something crazy with this the point is risotto is something amazing and that should be treated with respect but also maybe break the rules a little bit do something fancy use this moment to learn it practice it try the balls as everyone should and go on your merry way so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] [Music]

BUT if you make it at home using these instructions, I think you can shave it down to around 1 dollar per serving. Sounds...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, let me paint a little scenario you want to have a nice little night out go get some sushi 10 to 15 per roll and now you've spent 70 dollars you can have that same night but for this price right here and that is but cheaper [Music] so [Music] the average cost of most sushi rolls can range anywhere from 10 upwards of 20 maybe even 30 if you're getting a really fancy one at the end of the day what you're paying for is a product that most people think they can't make and that's just not true you just need a little bit of technique you need a little bit of care and you can make it yourself at home honestly quite easily just be patient okay i'm gonna try and be as flexible as possible but i will say that there is one non-negotiable that both myself and i believe that uncle roger would agree with so with all that said let's make this shall we okay for all the people who are new to sushi please understand that rice is the most important component of your life if you mess it up both papa and uncle roger will be at your doorstep waiting now look i've already done a guide on how to prepare sushi rice the link is in the description but for a brief recap need two cups of sushi rice always wash your rice and we're gonna wash it twice add it to your rice cooker with equal parts water and no i'm not budging on this i know it's butt cheaper please just use a rice cooker all right you're gonna make your seasoned rice vinegar which is super easy to make then once the rice is cooked you're gonna season it with your sushi zoo to taste and that's your sushi rice like i said before if you want to know the full recipe on this the link is in the description in my tamaki video so now we have our most important component the rice currently sitting at this price right here then just gather your rice up place it back in your rice cooker on the keep warm setting we've got three rolls for you classic spicy salmon tamaki a vegetable tamaki which i think might be vegetarian i'm pretty sure i don't ever trust myself to say that because i always forget that one ingredient and a pork belly makima to level things out let's start with the spicy salmon tamaki first thing we need to make is our fried shallots sure you can buy these but it'd be a whole lot cooler if you made them you'll need three shallots then slice your shallots as thinly and evenly as possible i really would recommend the mandolin in all seriousness put those in a medium pot with two cups of vegetable oil or just enough to cover place it on a stove set to medium high then begin constantly stirring the oil will slowly start to come up to light bubble then start frying violently and as soon as they turn golden brown immediately fish them out of the oil using a spider and drain them on paper towels these burn really easily so just try not to get distracted season them with salt while they're still hot now let those cool completely next you'll need half of an english cucumber but in order to get the length right cut a sheet of nori in half and cut the cucumber to the same width as the nori take that cuke and cut the cheeks off of it like this leaving the core behind then take those cheeks cut them into batons yes haha josh said cheeks very funny now for the salmon you're gonna need half a pound of sashimi grade salmon which surprisingly was only like eight bucks but you can switch this out for any sashimi grade fish you want or a cooked meat technically if you wanted to cut your fish using a very sharp knife using single strokes only into nice half inch cubes then in a separate bowl you're gonna combine a 30 cup of mayonnaise three tablespoons of sriracha one green onion thinly sliced salt and taste and one clove of grated garlic mix that together add in your salmon and toss to coat now to make your roll get yourself a sheet of nori cut it in half so you have two halves and repeat that so you have about eight to ten sheets take one of your half sheets dampen your hands with water and spread enough sushi rice along your nori to cover about three quarters of it you want the top to have a little bit of exposing oil next spoon on two to three tablespoons of your spicy salmon a cucumber baton top with crispy shallots and some sesame seeds roll that up from the bottom leaving a little tail of nori at the base and you have a lovely salmon tamaki for this price to make eight of them dude that means each tamaki's gonna cost this that's a big flex by the way uh these are hand rolls you eat them as a individual serving so just you know bite it like a burrito now you thought we weren't going to put fish you thought well you thought wrong aren't you kid just kidding we're not going to skip fish it's not happening salmon i think is going to be the closest most affordable raw fish you're going to get tuna is medium tuna is medium tear and expense so we want the lowest option with salmon spicy [Music] immediately it's already my favorite one so far the salmon's fresh it's spicy it's creamy salty umami what's the point of even going to dang restaurants sometimes you just want to make it yourself for this much money brother i've already made three of these now and look how much is left right and this salmon only costs eight dollars eight you're trying to tell me you're not gonna save money eat cooking at home get the hell out of here next up vegetable tamaki you're gonna start with two large portobello mushrooms and cut the cap into three quarter inch slices turn the slices flat side down and cut off the black gills of the mushroom then using a sharp knife score the flat side of the mushroom in a cross hatch pattern so it looks really cute and also so it cooks better do that again on the other side then fill a medium skillet with enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan heat it over medium heat until it is ripping hot then lay in your mushrooms avoid overcrowding the pan i like to use something to press it down this is a chef press i love these things use them all the time and let it sear for about two to three minutes give them a little flip to look at one of the most beautiful mushroom sears i've ever seen season the taste with salt and sear for another two minutes then remove the pan and repeat with the rest now in a small bowl combine a quarter cup of fresh mint leaves a quarter cup of fresh cilantro leaves and a quarter cup of fresh thai basil leaves toss it together until you've got a fragrant herbaceous forest of flavor now for assembly get a half sheet of nori spread out your rice add on an eighth of an avocado brush your avocado with soy sauce add your seared mushroom a nice cuke baton thinly sliced green onion and some of your herb salad oh and last but not least a nice handful of fried shallots then roll that absolute u-knit up nice and tight and marvel at its beauty but more specifically this amazing price for eight total tamaki meaning each tamaki will cost you this right here we got a tamaki hand roll we've done this before obviously but you know this is with the focus of it being affordable this is a vegetarian i think i think it's vegetarian and vegan i think i don't really think it that much through all i know is that it's mostly vegetables and there's no meat or animal products i think in here anyway a lot of people like josh why don't you give the vegetarians attention i'm doing it granted it's in the exact same format as before because it doesn't matter okay you can have this easy to make beautifully curated flavor for this price right here okay we saved the best for last a glazed pork belly maki roll before we start playing with our meat get yourself two nice large thick juicy goofy carrots peel them then julienne them as fine as possible i actually used a julienne peeler sure it's cheating but it works really well and it's fast link in the description for that place them in a jar so that they all fit nice and snug in there in a medium saucepan add two cups of vinegar one cup of water one tablespoon of salt and two teaspoons of sugar set that over high heat and as soon as it reaches a boil immediately pour that over your carrots ensure that the carrots stay completely submerged and let them sit until they reach room temperature bang pickled carrots oh and you getting out of splash of shiradashi for some umami and you know how papa feels about that next you're gonna need two pounds of skinless pork belly this one was much more than i needed for the record cut that in half so you get two even squares then slice that into two inch thick pieces so they look like these and then don't forget to take a pick for the gram obviously you can score the fat cap of your pork in a cross hatch pattern to help the fat render out then heat the pan over medium high heat spray it lightly with cooking oil you don't need much in here you just need it so it doesn't stick once that's screaming hot season your pork generously with salt lay them in the pan optionally you can add any spices you like i hit mine with some five spice and sear for about two to three minutes or until it reaches a beautiful golden brown then give them a flip once the other side is seared tilt the pan and crisp the fat cap up in the corner where all the fat is pooling just until it's nicely browned and looking like a snack now these are still raw in the center so pop that in the oven at 375 fahrenheit for about 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked through then optionally when they're done brush them with a little hoisin sauce you only need around a half cup of that once each piece is evenly coated in hoisin caramelize that glaze either under a broiler or if you're cool use a kitchen torch until it looks nice and glossy and icky sticky now we're almost there get one bunch of green onions cut off the root bottom and the green parts so you're left with whites and just a touch of green then heat two tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium-high heat until shimmering add your green onions and sear tossing occasionally for about three to four minutes or until you get some nice char and caramelization season that the taste with salt and set to the side all right assembly time this time get a full sheet of nori place it on a sushi mat add enough rice to evenly spread out to the edges leaving one inch of space at the top make sure you don't spread the rice too thick this was on the border of too much rice so practice until it's how you like it now snag a piece of pork belly cut it in half if it's really wide then slice those pieces in half lengthwise so you get two thinner pieces of belly place those on your rice at the bottom of the roll leaving a little bit of space from the edge layer on a couple pieces of seared green onion a generous handful of your pickled carrots optionally but very highly recommended some thinly sliced thai chili a handful of your herb salad from earlier then roll it up halfway give it a light crimp and then roll it up the rest of the way until the edge is closed and give it one more good crimp but don't you know strangulate the darn thing then take it out and look at that lovely log to slice get an extremely sharp long knife gently begin cutting until you reach about halfway down then use the length of your knife and draw all the way back to slice the rest of the way through the roll that way you get a nice clean cut then do that all the way down your roll and take a look at this beauty so we have this beautiful fancy roll that comes in at a price of this for six to eight rolls that means you're paying this for each roll it's pretty darn good deal if i ever see one last but not least is a classic makimono roll sliced of course i decided to go the meat route sacrilege i know i did a lot of things that are sacrilegious today but this looks damn good you got the pork belly it's glazed it's roasted it's fatty pickled carrot salty umami i had a splash of shiradashi because i like it grilled green onion you know you can't go wrong with that so without further ado that was intrusive i've never had something disappear into my mouth like that before the meat is fatty and hot and sweet the pickled carrots immediately cut the richness it's chewy i feel like this hits all the notes that i want on sushi great with fish too but you know there's nothing wrong with a nice fatty piece of glazed pork belly or barbecue pork belly if you want in a maki roll and it looks pretty did you want to give it a kiss if you want sushi and you don't want to spend a ton of money on it you've come to the right place you can have any of these rolls for this price this price or this price it's up to you you want to know what else is a thick log filled with various surprises and ready to be consumed [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made three different kinds of sushi rolls well tamaki and one makimono but you get the point at the end of the day i'm just trying to give you implications ways that you can fill a sushi roll but you can do it however you want fill it whatever you want you don't have to follow these recipes to a tea it's just a guide it's just to get you started if you just put vegetables in a sushi roll like it's rice nori vegetables cost you like a dollar stop making excuses darn it anyway if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time and the sun's going away bye [Music] [Music] you

It's fairly simple to make, yet oh so amazing. Obviously, garlic bread has had some serious clout since it's invention... okay maybe...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, this is a story a fairy tale if you will of three of the greatest foods in the world coming together butter garlic and bread okay so today we are making garlic bread if it's not uh evident already which it it should be it's a fairly simple thing this has always had clout since it was invented do i know it was invented not really let's look it up there's very little history there's literally one sentence garlic bread stems from bruschetta i find it hard to believe that this is based off of the point is that garlic and butter already make sense together and bread also makes sense with those three ingredients we combine them and make something greater than the sum of all of its parts we're not just gonna stop with just a simple garlic bread we have three for you so with all that said let's make this shall we right so to kick things off here we're going to start with a beautifully low effort garlic bread garlic bread in quotations really anyway snag yourself a solid loaf of bread or baguette slice it into slices or in this case slice your baguette in half spread a generous amount of softened butter on each slice make sure to coat it edge to edge then press it into a cold pan set it over medium heat and let that bad boy toast obviously if this is a slice of bread you know you're gonna butter the other side unless you wanna upset papa once your bread is perfectly toasted flip it and toast the other side again unless it's a baguette remove your toast from the pan and immediately cut a clove of garlic in half and rub the cut end all over the bread the crustier the toast the more garlicky it will be this is sort of scenting the piece of bread trust me it works then optionally spread on some more butter hit it with some flaky salt and that's it it's a low effort garlic bread now let's taste and see if this low effort toasty man actually tastes like garlic bread so this is for the people who want the low effort garlic bread now it's not a traditional garlic bread but nobody really talks about this and i don't know why it's toasted and it's scented now this is why i usually make my own bread because the spread kind of sucks but although this is low effort you get a very sort of subdued garlic flavor but in a good way almost scented with garlic you take a little bite and the garlic's like oh my god i love you so much and that's what the garlic says now let's make the real stuff next up we have the fan favorite traditional and simple yet somehow perfect garlic bread in a medium sized bowl add 1 cup or 220 grams of unsalted butter softened unless you want to have a bad time 4 to 6 cloves of finely chopped garlic a quarter cup of finely chopped parsley that's italian flat leaf parsley all right none of the curly stuff that's just nobody likes it a quarter cup of grated parmigiano-reggiano that's parmigiano-reggiano not parmesan all right the real deal stuff makes a huge difference anyway mix all it together until thoroughly incorporated and you've got your garlic butter now all you need is well bread for this one i'd recommend a large loaf of shabata then all you have to do is cut that in half lengthwise pop that bad boy open then using a specialist spread your butter on the cut sides of both pieces of bread make sure that you're coating this thing edge to edge you may not use all of your butter but you'll likely use the majority of it if you have any leftovers do yourself a favor and save it and finish it on some pasta or in some soup now place your buttered up bread on a foil-lined baking sheet and go into the oven set to 400 fahrenheit or 205 celsius for about 10 to 12 minutes or until it's lightly toasted and golden and the butter has soaked nicely into the bread pull it out slice it into one inch chunky pieces like this then serve it as is or hit it with some more parm serve it with marinara you know it's all up to you now just as the historians have said let us put this in our mouth we have our traditional garlic bread now we've all seen this it's in the restaurants it's in the pretty pictures on inky glam it's very basic you know it's butter garlic parsley you put it on bread you put the bread in the oven it's as simple as that without further ado this might be the best garlic bread i've ever had it actually tastes of garlic it's rich it's crunchy and you've got that parmesan cheese in the back it's like we're not going to end on some simple garlic bread i think we can take this a little further maybe a little bit more of like a fancy garlic bread okay last but not least is a bit of a fancier version garlic confit bread so first thing get a medium-sized sauce pot and add 1 cup or 220 grams of unsalted butter and 10 cloves of peeled garlic leave them whole don't slice them set that over medium heat let the butter melt completely and then once the butter starts to lightly simmer just let that cook for about 15 minutes swirling occasionally or until the garlic is very smooth and cooked through and a little bit caramelized and let that cool enough until it starts to become a paste i like to stir it in a bowl set over an ice bath until it reaches that proper consistency it's a faster way to get it to cool down than just letting it sit there which is annoying remove your garlic mash it up until it's a paste then incorporate that back into the butter next let's make our crispy prosciutto get three to four slices of prosciutto and ensure the deli person who slices it doesn't you know completely obliterate it like they did with mine here it's whatever lightly oil a medium-sized non-stick skillet add your prosciutto in one layer set the heat to medium and let those cook flipping occasionally until browned and completely crisp about 2-4 minutes drain those on paper towels and once they've cooled completely chop your prosciutto until you get a medium fine crumble like this then chop the leaves from one sprig of rosemary nice and fine combine the two place it in a bowl and oh don't forget to add an additional three tablespoons of finely chopped fresh italian parsley toss that together and place to the side now to your coffee garlic butter add two cloves of finely chopped black garlic half a tablespoon of sichuan chili flakes the zest of one lemon one cup of grated parmigiano-reggiano and two tablespoons of good olive oil this is actually a white truffle oil from the homies at regalis foods that's not a sponsorship by the way they're just homies and they send me this stuff and they're good people hit that with a generous amount of salt and black pepper then stir until thoroughly combined now this time we're gonna get a nice sourdough batard this one is about 10 or so inches long cut that in half lengthwise place it on a foil lined baking sheet cut side down and then into an oven set to 400 fahrenheit or 205 celsius for 8 minutes to get out of the oven flip it so the cut set is now facing up and let it cool for about 2 minutes then apply your confit garlic butter spread it edge to edge over each piece then give it a generous grating of some additional parmigiano pop it under your broiler for 2 to 4 minutes or until melty and deeply browned pull it out then let that cool slightly and top with your herby prosciutto mixture slice it into pieces and enjoy your fancy garlic bread with some nice jams cured meat or drizzle of balsamic it's all up to you you know you got options now let's taste and compare this with the others so this is a sourdough loaf of bread this is a fatty [Music] jiggle this is no longer garlic bread this is like ascended to something special you serve this with a charcuterie board you don't eat this by itself next to a crappy steak dinner if we're comparing these two options to that of the you know low effort garlic bread i think we have a clear winner and honestly to me for nostalgia for bonus points for simplicity for ease of use and deliciousness it goes directly to the og garlic bread now with that said let's not eliminate our new guy on the block this goes really well with something nicer this is like if you want garlic bread but you want a more adult version whichever one you choose whether it's the ultra easy ultra classic and the ultra fancified you're gonna have garlic bread either way and in my opinion that's a win in any situation you wanna know what else is soaked hot and packed with garlic b-roll [Music] or guys and that is it so we made garlic bread three different ways we had our ultra ultra low effort version which is barely garlic bread we had our second classic one and then our third which is sort of like a fancy off the beaten path of garlic bread one thing i would note about the third is i think it might have even been better if i added a little bit of raw garlic to it as well either way it was still delicious and i bet it would have been wonderful with a little drizzle of aged balsamic on there or some sort of uh tartness to it i hope you enjoyed this and i hope you're eating more garlic bread because of it so with all that

It's our first cake to cross off the list on the but better series, and I think we've got a good shot. 

Recipe: https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/d...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, before we discuss molten chocolatey whatever all i've got to say is we've outpizzaed the hut you think we can't out domino their molten chocolate cake get out of here [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so we are doing the domino's molten chocolate cake with crunch or something like that something about crunch i don't know potato chips it's chocolate love cake we all know it we've had it before at multiple restaurants we've seen the whole like chef casper from the movie chef yelling at him saying this this video has two agendas obviously we want to be dominoes the second and the second is that we want to figure out if the ganache center or the under baked center is better so with all that said let's make this shall we because this dominoes i figured makes sense to just order it it'd be weird if we went there and we'd be like hey can we cake please whoa this has a four stars out of five this is the michelin one our lobby is closed for dine in service do people dine in at domino's you're dining no you're not you're stoned are you all serving the molten chocolate cakes this early i'll get two orders of them they're not very big then i'll do i'll do three of them then okay good upsell oh they're really small [Music] he woke up baked and i'm not talking about the chocolate lava cakes went to work and then i called and he immediately was like oh [ __ ] yeah you know they're small right hey goodbye i haven't even opened these and i'm already ready to go off gato avec and underneath that it says for those who don't know fancy speak chocolate lava crunch cakes sir this is not fancy speak this is just another nation's language for those who don't know fancy speak crunchy lava cakes dad they went on google translate typed this in and it's not even 100 correct and so the french people who are watching this are probably like we these look like two charcoal briquettes let's toss these under the grill let's make some burgers see if it oozes it's not oozing but it's it's molten this tastes a lot cheaper than i remember it tastes genuinely like hershey's chocolate syrup that's not a good thing if anyone's saying oh i love hershey's chocolate choc and the crunch is not really there i thought it was going to be chewy but it's just like crunchy because it's overcooked and there's no salt get some poopy on my finger it's not terrible but 100 not deserving of the clout we could definitely do this i'm going to give you two ways to flex on them okay folks we got two versions here it's the underbaked versus da ganache center versus dominoes let's begin with the sacrilegious under baked version first start with four six ounce ramekins grease each of them with butter then powder them lightly with all-purpose flour rotate the flour around the ramekin to coat all the walls then dump out the excess flour repeat that with all of your ramekins then fill a medium saucepot with about half an inch of water bring that to a simmer and in a medium sized bowl ideally glass you're gonna add 165 grams exactly of bittersweet chocolate around 50 to 60 cacao and half a cup or 115 grams of unsalted cold butter place that on top of your simmering water please make sure the bowl isn't touching the water okay this is not a skinny dipping zone let the heat melt stirring occasionally then while that's going on in a separate bowl add two eggs and two egg yolks begin beating those two together using either an electric beater with a whisk attachment or a good old fashioned elbow grease once that begins to turn a little lighter in color and the volume about doubles add in one and a half tablespoons or 21 grams of brown sugar three tablespoons or 43 grams of granulated sugar gradually till all of it is added half a teaspoon or three grams of fine sea salt and one and a half teaspoons or five grams of vanilla extract keep on mixing that chocolate and butter together until it's completely melted and smooth then add your egg mixture to the chocolate and fold fold fold until thoroughly combined finally fold in 2 tablespoons or 20 grams of all-purpose flour until combined and there you have your cake batter divide your batter evenly between all of your ramekins and place in an oven that's been preheated to 450 fahrenheit or 230 celsius for about 10 to 11 minutes be careful here because we want them to be under baked the outside should be set but the inside should be just a touch jiggly then just pull them out let them cool for one minute in the ramekin make sure they're loosened and invert onto a plate dust them with powdered sugar optionally brulee that sugar to a beautiful crisp using a blow torch then dust once more with powdered sugar and let's see that inside give it a cut spread it open and oh my this one is juicy now let's taste it so this is the under baked cake some people hate this see this has always been my go-to way of doing it i don't tell people this because people whine and cry and they're like but chef casper said in the movie that you have to put ganache john favreau i want to kiss him i'm both cheeks but this is fantastic there's nothing wrong with this at all compared to the dominoes this one actually tastes like chocolate you understand we have two different options right this one is basically like the kraft singles cheese and then this one is the fine gouda made in a farmhouse right outside of amsterdam smoking a pipe filled with artisanal tobacco there's a roast in the oven they've got a la cornu range there's lavender fields everywhere that's this one okay oh my god you see it's the steam from my anguish taste tester now tj get get over here there you go that's number one hello you want to blow a little okay keep baby safe that's number two oh hot the second one sucks it just tastes like sugar crunchy it's got a nice texture to it but that first one just tastes like rich chocolate it's got spongy soft cake to it you heard it here second one's trash hold on now we're not done yet next up is the internet's favorite the ganache version first we gotta well make our ganache it's real simple in a sauce pot add six tablespoons or 90 milliliters of heavy cream and a small pinch of salt place it over medium heat and as soon as it's hot and just barely simmering pour that over two and a half ounces or 70 grams of very finely chopped bittersweet chocolate let that stand for three minutes optionally you can cover with plastic wrap to help that insulate the heat then whisk all that together till melted and velvety smooth now just chill that in the fridge for about 30 minutes or until set now while that's setting we'll make our cake base which is very similar to the last one in your janky bon marie setup like last time you're gonna instead add four ounces or 115 grams of bittersweet chocolate a quarter cup or 56 grams of unsalted butter again steam stir heat until you know beautifully melted in smooth in a separate bowl add three whole eggs and don't forget to drop some shell in there to bruise your ego then beat that until lightened in color and doubled in volume then add a quarter cup or 60 grams of granulated sugar gradually a small pinch of salt and half a teaspoon or two grams of vanilla extract keep beating that together so you get a voluminous smooth light eggy boy again add the egg mixture to the chocolate fold together until thoroughly combined and homogeneous and add in a quarter cup or 37 grams of all-purpose flour fold that together to get a smooth batter then divide half of your total batter amongst four four ounce ramekins then to each of those ramekins add a thick and heaping teaspoon of your chilled ganache and try to keep that ganache an actual like brown ball rather than a craggly mess then divide your remaining batter evenly amongst your ramekins until each has had their ganache covered then just pop those in an oven set to 375 fahrenheit or 190 celsius for 15 minutes or until the cake is cooked through and of course the ganache is melted you don't have to worry too much about overcooking the molten center since the ganache is well gonna stay molten then just pull those guys out cool them for two minutes in their ramekins if needed run a knife around the edges and carefully invert onto a plate dust it with powdered sugar relay that brother again optional but a whole lot cooler if you did dust it again pop it open and look at that a little more molten on the inside a little more liquidatious if you will but let's see if the taste matches its looks oh my gosh in the movie chef he put ganache so that's the only that's the right way well there's many ways to skinny cat alright but we did it that way anyway to a piece of the haters i decide a winner on the ganache versus non-ganache i just want to say that the ganache beats this whether you have that or not undercooked or ganache doesn't matter this needs to go away more importantly we need a taste tester this is the uh ganache filling can't say that now i gotta why did i do that one of them has poop and one of them has pee number one number two i think i'm gonna go with the first one really you're picking the first one man these [ __ ] don't know there's just more chocolatey like taste to it this tastes like hershey's chocolate and this tastes like actual chocolate i like can't stand dark chocolate sorry it tastes like cocoa puffs what the hell did you eat this is way better dude everybody that watches the channel it only eats cocoa puffs and craft singles vikram is your man for anyone who has like the ability to translate information and then digest it and then output it and tj will come in and apply that for us thank you so much here's domino's now between the two cakes is the under baked or is the ganache better i honestly really like the ganache the most the taste and the little bit of crispy and crunchiness that's what sold me i like the underbaked one the most there's just more intensity to it the benefit is you don't have the extra step of making the goddamn ganache long story short we've come to a winner we have two different options you choose your own adventure but the true winner here today is us if you're not a dark chocolate lover add a little more sugar and you'll be just fine okay vikram you want to know what else is chocolaty warm and ready to ooze onto your plate geez that sounded a lot less terrible on paper [Music] b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made the domino's chocolate lava cake i did discover one thing about this which is it does make sense to me how somebody would maybe prefer a sweeter interior in their molten chocolate lava cake i prefer to actually taste deeply and rich of chocolate dark chocolate a little bit of bitterness but not too much and it's just very rich and decadent others may be more used to more sugary and hershey's flavor i guess i don't know the point is add more sugar but maybe also work on like what chocolate should actually taste like anyway this is obviously a childhood favorite for many so you can pick whichever one makes the best sense for you i'd still really like the underbaked one i'm not gonna lie with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] [Music] you

This is my iteration with 3 different options for the classic fried cheese. While technically only one...,2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, cheese is already a beautiful thing as it is but you bread it you fry it it's cheesy gooey do i really need to say anything [Music] else [Music] this is gonna be a little different today the apron is off so you know it's gonna be special we're celebrating 3 million subscribers together wow would you look at that well first off we're a little bit late and i apologize for that it's been very busy we've been trying to do a bunch of stuff i'm not gonna make excuses the point is i couldn't be more thankful and it's because of you guys because of the support of everyone who enjoys what we do thank you doesn't even suffice anymore now it's just we're gonna do more we're gonna do it bigger and better and all that to the house and studio tour this is the kitchen you know it you understand it you usually only see this plane but there's you know there's other parts that make up a kitchen pantry as of right now it's a massive mess we did our best to try and kind of get some sort of organization but you know sometimes it gets a little bit chaotic we've also added this to the door this was a buddy of mine cam he came up with this whole idea and i think this is great the way that i've tried to organize this is like this is all spices only spices and like a couple dried items like dates this is all flowers grains and sugars and nuts on the far right everything else is kind of just melted together it will get better we are technically on the second floor by the way plaque on the wall one million times three here's the craziest thing we received this what 12 months ago or less less than a year ago now we're at triple that it's been a wild year for a lot of people and i'm super grateful for what we've all gotten as a team and it's due to you guys so anyway first floor this is technically a townhouse it's not like a house house because there's multiple it's built tall and skinny um this is the guest room now there's a very special thing about the bathroom in the guest room this was for vikram when he started uh when he was looking for a place to live in houston i thought you know i want to give vikram a gift so i gave him a big gift the perk of living in a really tall town house that's this tall is a lot of them actually have the benefits what i'm trying to say is that is the benefit of having an elevator you put the tripod in here vikram mommy's here to greet us oh hello he's here this is vikram's favorite thing to do is be in a small space with me this is the uh this is our bedroom the bedroom after living here for i think six months now i've kind of got to a point where now i'm ready to actually already move out long story short we're building something very special back in austin all right finally the fourth floor you always have a bathroom in your office with a shower this is um this is essentially our two editing base we edit all the videos here tj also edits it on his computer on this desk over here this is where the voiceover happens it's the same mic that i started with since zero subscribers we've got to stop talking now because kate's about to take a very important exam and we've got to get to editing so let's move on to the recipe alright so we're going to start with old reliable the classic mozzarella stick with ranch specifically look you can use marinara but i'm a ranch with moth sticks kind of guy that's right judge me all you want on that note here's how to make the ranch real simple in a medium sized bowl combine three quarters of a cup or 116 grams of mayonnaise half a cup 125 grams of creme fresh 1 tablespoon or 25 grams of dijon mustard begin whisking that together then stream in half a cup or 120 grams of buttermilk now once you have that add half a bunch of finely sliced chives half a cup of finely chopped parsley three sprigs of dill also finely chopped and three cloves of garlic grated season that to taste with salt and pepper then whisk all that together and enjoy one of the greatest ranch dressings to exist on this planet maybe that's a little bit much but you get the point it's good now normally with these kinds of mozzarella sticks you need bread crumbs but as you know we make our own seasoned breadcrumbs from scratch you'll need about eight thin slices of a simple white loaf of bread line those on some baking sheets you don't need to coat them or anything and toss them in an oven set to 275 fahrenheit or 135 celsius for about 15 minutes also if your oven doesn't go that low then just put it as low as it can go after about 15 minutes or until it's very dry and crumbly let that cool completely then toss some of the bread in the food processor begin processing so it all fits nice and snug in there then add one teaspoon or five grams of salt one teaspoon or three grams of dried thyme one teaspoon or three grams of dried oregano one teaspoon or four grams of black pepper ground obviously and one teaspoon or four grams of garlic powder blend that together until you get a nice fine well uh bread crumb texture like you see right here and that's all it takes now for the breading station you'll need one bowl with one cup or 150 grams of all-purpose flour another bowl with your seasoned breadcrumbs and one bowl with three large eggs whisk together until combined and smooth then all you need to do is cut up two large blocks of low moisture mozzarella into half-inch batons remember to keep them even so that they fry evenly it's a simple concept then to bread take a baton dip it in the flour dust off the excess toss it to coat in the eggs and finally toss it in the bread crumbs to coat every crevice now just repeat that whole process one more time to double coat your mozzarella sticks if it's undercoated it will burst in the oil so always double coat now just get a pot filled with about two and a half inches of oil for frying making sure not to go beyond three quarters full in the pot heat that vapor to 350 fahrenheit or 175 celsius then just carefully lay those guys in the oil in batches and fry for one to three minutes or until they get a nice golden brown like this be aware that if you leave them in there too long the cheese will boil and start to leak out so try to balance that cook time now toss those on wire racks to drain as you're frying the rest and then you'll be left with beautiful sticks ready to serve with your wrench and enjoy a most sensuous cheese pull up this is where you cue the sexy music yummy okay the classic in me there's not much to say about this we all know what this represents all right this is childhood memories you live in america we got the ranch all right you could do marinara there's nothing wrong with marinara i know you guys are probably thinking josh i can't believe you're just doing ranch it's too much then go make a marinara josh i want your beer in there well then don't judge me don't judge me i'm gonna eat my feelings [Music] this has the classic traditional mozzarella stick flavor that you want but just up another level it's crispier because we made our own bread crumbs from scratch we actually control the flavor so you can make it taste like whatever you want you want like a chicken curry flavored mozzarella stick that's an idea why didn't i do that what the these are classic mozzarella stick but upgraded now next we've got something special okay next i decided to fancify this and make giant fried brie cubes because i can you'll need one large wheel of brie okay maybe not this large maybe like a quarter or half this size then just cut it into cubes that are roughly one and a half inches by one and a half inches two notes really keep these guys even i know i always say it but papa never lies and second is to leave the skin on so it doesn't melt too quickly when frying now we're gonna prep these katsu style here we have one bowl filled with one cup or 150 grams of all-purpose flour another with one and a half cups or 140 grams of panko bread crumbs and another with two whole eggs beaten together beautifully now first coat every single edge inside nook and cranny in the flour shake off the excess then coat in the egg and finally toss in the panko insuring to really press the panko so it sticks on every single side then place those on a tray and repeat with the rest of your cubes take your tray put it in the freezer for one hour no more no less if they freeze they won't fry properly we're just firming these brothers up then in that same oil setup heat the oil to 360 degrees fahrenheit or 180 celsius and from cold fry in batches for three to four minutes or until deep golden brown and the cheese is completely melted on the inside you can always do a test one first to get it right then fry the rest then drain each batch on a wire rack as they finish frying and serve immediately i mean look at this that is ooey gooey hours right there now some might look at this and go oh a cube a fried cube no no this is a cube of fried brie now i'm not actually going to ranch this one because i've been eating these all day it's ooey gooey on the inside literally like like ah it's so hot don't do that just be careful okay i mean it's ridiculous it's super rich really really intense ultra cheesy fatty crunchy this would be a lot better rather than having this i would even serve this with like an aged balsamic vinegar it's for my buddies that regales it's an aged black truffle balsamic okay i'm just gonna take a little piece here and it's very thick holy dude dick you gotta try this dude boom stupid that's unbelievably stupid that's so good it is it tj the the acid the richness the sweetness the truffle brie crunch we got our verdict on that i got one more for you after this let's move on to that okay okay we got our two fried guys but i've got one more for you what about pan-fried cheese here we have a pan-fried samorza topped with homemade jam and caviar we're on the caviar kick with this one i'm sorry i had to do it you don't have to do caviar all right it's just yummy now what is gamorza you might ask sounds gross but it's a beautiful southern italian cheese similar to mozzarella but with more complex flavor and it's a little firmer and obviously pan toastable first cut it in half remove the waxy exterior then cut it in half again to form quarters then slice those into little wedges about three quarters of an inch thick now heat a dry non-stick skillet over medium heat until very hot add your cheese pan fry until golden about one to two minutes then flip and fry on the other side for about the same amount of time and repeat with enough cheese to fill a plate or as much as you want now plate it all up top some of your cheese with strawberry jam and a small pinch of fresh thyme leaves and then top the others with a tiny drizzle of honey and a little dollop of nice caviar it's flexy fancy makes an incredible amuse boosh for a party or a nice segue during a lovely evening netflix and chill now let us have our final taste test scamorza now they look a little flat but that doesn't matter if you've never had seared cheese before like halloumi you have never lived we've got two options here strawberry jam thyme and black pepper and then we have truffle honey and caviar not trying to flex it's just i happen to have it and so i thought i would put it on there people want to yell at me i think we'll start with the strawberry this is upsetting because from my perspective this is nearly better almost more exciting of a near eating experience than either of the mozzarella sticks because it's so intense when this is hot all i gotta say is you're gonna bust it over the next one is gonna be the truffle honey and the see the sheen on that you're a caviar person that's for you the caviar applies that extra saltiness that you want the brininess the richness now wait a minute what if we take the jam and the caviar and then make a little sandwich what if you do that [Music] that actually works it layers through the flavors with that done we have three different options for your mozzarella sticks obviously this is not mozzarella nor is the brie but the point is it's fried cheese and if you like fried cheese this is the only guide you're going to need you want to know what's better than mozzarella sticks a very special 20 20 year in review b-roll [Music] so one thing that i've learned about 2020 is not so much that it's like oh man we can't do anything about this it's more so just being understanding to other people's problems you never know what's going on with somebody so let's make 21 be a little more kind to each other let's be a little more loving to each other that's all i want to say let's hop over to the q a the cold brew gotta get nice and snuggly slides underneath this you gotta tuck yourself in it's question time oh my god yay it's so fun this comes from david noel spina should you have worked at a restaurant to open a successful restaurant that is a very good question successful is a subjective term successful in the sense of great food probably you should have worked in a restaurant if you really wanted to win on both the financial aspect but more specifically the food aspect because you're used to both sides and balancing the two when you've worked at one before assuming that you've worked a position that would teach you that it's hard for me to speak on that because i myself haven't opened a restaurant yet there's plenty of examples of businessmen and women and so on who have open restaurants and they've been financially successful but the food blows okay so oh here's a really good one this one comes in from sebastian mcconey real talk can you give advice about how to make recipes your own assuming he's how to create a recipe uh he's been teaching himself to bake and he's been getting really good results he feels like an imposter because he's mostly following instructions rather than applying technique and getting creative you have to learn everything first you can't just go out and just think that you're magically going to create a recipe how are you supposed to know how to make a nice cupcake batter having never made cupcakes in your life you have to have tried a multitude of recipes and then you provide multiple layers of context develop a basic understanding with all the different recipes you tried and then you apply all the knowledge you've learned from that to then make your own then you'll figure out how it works simple as that good question derek duker that's a balling name what is your favorite video you've ever made that's like asking who your favorite child is i mean come on that's that's that's ludicrous you can't ask that it's 100 the popeyes video uh that's what started it all with the whole but better series and i love that series in my mind it was more of like this seems like a fun thing to try and i feel like i could totally outdo these guys it's been a really fun journey sort of getting to that you know creative challenge and constantly pitting myself up against these companies who've had years and years to develop something perfectly and i give myself like a couple days to get it right not even sometimes just a day that's been a lot of fun this comes from fernando and he says uh what do you miss most about working at a restaurant that is a very good question fernando for one the biggest thing that i miss is the people i miss being with all my homies everyone's supporting each other and you know when you go through this you go through this together and now i have vickerman tj we're building our own version of our family here so i i think that that'll come back and i i don't feel like i'm going to be missing it for long moving forward but i definitely miss that like intense that cooking intensity of like dish after dish border after order and uh yeah it's just a special feeling that i can't describe unless you've done it before all right guys and that is it so we made our mozzarella sticks but wait again another moment to step back and say thank you guys so so much for 3 million subscribers we're so thankful the support is just unbelievably amazing and we're so grateful and just thank you just another thank you i know we've said it probably a million times in this video anyway point is thank you mozzarella sticks obviously these weren't all mozzarella but it's the essence of fried cheese it is it is what that represents the crispity crunch and then the gooey gooey cheese pulley center you know there's nothing better than that so whether you prefer it like a plain mozzarella literal stick with italian breadcrumbs or you want something fancy like a deep-fried brie cube doesn't matter it's all up to your own personal choice if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time you

Today we are taking a look at homemade Starbucks coffee drinks, but only 3 of the top seasonal choices. Except like… we’re...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, the last time we did this one i said i didn't really want to do it and i only did it because people wanted me to do it it's a lot of doing it and we're back on starbucks by popular demand and i think for good reason [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so it is the holiday season that's why i just you know it makes sense everybody was really happy with the starbucks video we did we've got three of the most popular drinks that starbucks has ever created i'm sorry if yours isn't on the list but with all that said let's make these shall we before we get started let's add the pumpkin spice latte i know you've been asking for it so here you go [Applause] good evening no okay we're back at starbucks i don't know why i feel like it was just yesterday that we did starbucks and obliterated them so we're gonna do that again but this time it's a holiday spirit i get a grande hot caramel brule latte a grande hot peppermint mocha and then one grande eggnog no no worries thank you so much so we've got our drinks we're gonna go back and taste test these and see how uh how they are we have three beveraginos here well first off let's take a look on the inside see how those look where's my whipped cream aren't they supposed to put whipped cream on this you have to ask what is this that's not even all the way full this is kind of sad there's this is what they all look like and then this is what the advertisement looks like what's the difference we'll start with the nog because i love eggnog this tastes nothing like eggnog 98 milk 1 coffee and 1 eggnog ok uh caramel brule latte that just tastes like sweet milk no brulee about that i can feel the fat on my lips this is what everybody is losing their mind about josh get you the peppermint mocha my expectations for this are astronomically high due to the volume of people that love this so much that's it that's what the hype is about there's a layer of oil on top of this there is literally a layer do you see that layer that separated layer syrup is a liquid it doesn't separate like fat does you know how fat and water separates that's a layer of fat see how i dip my finger and there's nothing on it but but shimmering i'm moisturizing my hands with it now i need to wash them oh yeah what is this oh my god let's just make this okay let's get this starbucks part two on the road we got three drinks eggnog latte peppermint mocha and the caramel brule latte thingy let me start by saying this i do not consider whipped cream on a latte to be legally allowed but in the starbucks tradition we're gonna do it uh so don't yell at papa let's begin with the eggnog latte first we're gonna make our own eggnog sorbot will just never compare in a medium sauce pot add one cup of granulated sugar three cups of whole milk and the beans from one whole vanilla bean add the whole vanilla bean pod too why not whisk it together set that over medium low heat then keep heating and whisking and once the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is hot but not boiling or simmering get a separate bowl and add five to six egg yolks depending on their size whisk the egg yolks together then add a small needle full of your hot liquid to the yolks whisk that in then keep doing that just until your egg yolks are tempered and by tempered i mean nice and hot add your yolk mixture back to the milk then add one teaspoon of ground cinnamon a quarter teaspoon of ground cloves one and a half tablespoons of ground ginger powder and two teaspoons of fresh grated nutmeg whisk all that together and continue heating over medium-low heat while continuously mixing making sure that this mixture does not simmer or boil please two things will happen if you let it simmer or boil for one papa will be mad and for two you'll cook the yolks and get a gross mess and cry in the corner you want the mixture around 175 fahrenheit the entire time anyway after five to eight minutes the mixture should have thickened and should coat the back of a spoon nicely like this strain that through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl set over an ice bath and start mixing that just until the mixture is totally cool then whisk in one and a half cups of heavy cream and a quarter cup of brandy cognac or bourbon you can skip the alcohol if you want but it's an iconic flavor addition now making the lattes pretty easy you'll need a quarter cup of whole milk add in half a cup of your eggnog now look you can heat that up over the stove but i chose to steam mine with my espresso machine steam wand once it's nice and hot go ahead and pull two shots of espresso from an espresso machine link in the description for the one that i used and alternatively you could use half a cup of cold brew concentrate that's been heated up or half a cup of a mocha pot espresso totally up to you then just mix your coffee with your hot eggnog mixture until thoroughly combined then pour that into a coffee mug top with a nice swirl of whipped cream and hit that with some additional fresh grated nutmeg or a dusting of cinnamon we'll taste test these at the end so let's move on to the next latte next up we have your precious little peppy mint mocha i don't know why people love this so much but anyway whatever instead of chemicals let's start off with a mint infused simple syrup in a small saucepan combine one cup of sugar and one cup of water whisk that together and heat that over medium heat until the sugar is completely dissolved and the mixture is hot and steamy then just drop in two bunches of fresh mint turn off the heat and let that steep for 15 minutes then remove your mint strain the liquid and bada bing bada boom you got a minty syrup now to make your latte heat up half a cup of whole milk until very hot then add a quarter cup or one ounce of finely chopped unsweetened chocolate mix that together until completely melted and combined you may need to hit it with a little additional heat if that doesn't finish dissolving then again pull two espresso shots or half a cup of your heated up cold brew concentrate blah blah blah mix that into your chocolaty milk and from there you'll add about two to four tablespoons of your mint syrup or until it reaches your desired level of sweetness and mint flavor mix that together until thoroughly combined pour it into your favorite coffee mug top with a fan of whipped cream and add some finely grated chocolate on top just for the flex okay last but not least is the caramel brulee latte and yes we're going to make little cream cheese on top so don't even go there on that note to make the crunchies in a medium sauce pot add 1 cup of sugar 6 tablespoons of water and three tablespoons of bourbon or just more water if you don't want the alcohol now whisk that together until combined then heat over medium heat bring it to a boil and let it boil until it turns a very deep amber color then immediately whisk in one tablespoon of unsalted butter as soon as that's combined pour that onto a baking sheet lined with a silpat or parchment paper and let that cool completely once it's cooled it should be nice and hard then snap it into pieces place it in a plastic bag beat that thing up until you get nice crumbles like these then just set it to the side now we also need a caramel sauce which is a very similar process get a medium saucepan add one cup of granulated sugar two and a half tablespoons of water and two tablespoons of bourbon whisk that together and this time set it over medium-high heat bring it up to a boil and let it boil and reduce until it reaches a slightly less dark amber color then whisk in four and a half tablespoons of unsalted butter one teaspoon of fine sea salt once that's combined turn off the heat and whisk in half a cup of heavy cream and one teaspoon of vanilla extract i mean look at that that is a beautiful caramel sauce now pour that into a container and let it cool don't worry if it looks a little runny because it's gonna thicken as it cools now to assemble your latte heat up three quarters of a cup of milk until very hot add in those two shots of hot espresso or your heated up cold brew blah blah blah and one to two heaping tablespoons of your caramel sauce or to taste now once that's thoroughly combined pour that into your coffee mug top with your velvety whipped cream and finish it off with a nice helping of your crunchy brulee topping and that right there is a salty bourbon caramel brulee latte now let's see how the taste of ours compare with little starbucks okay so in order to make this uh not weird and no mouth-to-mouth i'm gonna use a spoon so tj can taste test this afterwards so the eggnog latte i mean wow this is already my favorite drink of the winter look normally my order is this a quad shot ice latte with whole milk 16 ounces no sugar nothing else just milk and espresso this well if i wasn't on a diet i would have this every morning anyway the stupid peppermint stupid latte immediately immediately you've got that rich chocolate the peppermint's there it doesn't taste artificial like the other one this one actually has a fresh mint flavor but it actually co-mingles more properly with the real chocolate flavor all right last this is something to be sipped all right don't do this this is just stupid that's the special one oh between this and this my favorite out of these three split between the eggnog and the caramel brulee my personal favorite right off the bat caramel brulee it's the least sweet it's got salty caramel good for me now more specifically did we win which ones did we win i would say we won every single category but obviously i can't say that because i'm biased and josh you have to have somebody come taste otherwise you just always say you win can't always win that's not true you can always win and i hope that happens today so tj come on up have a little taste all right there we go so we're all set after this short break [Music] they're both like pretty decent but i'm gonna go with number two yeah like i mean they're both pretty good wait which is which one are you picking this one okay which these okay wait taste these again that's one okay and then that's two i just want to make sure that we got the right thing here because i'm like actually kind of surprised by that yeah this one that's one oh it is okay yeah we're going with one then this seems rigged but i swear to god [Laughter] here's number one okay so that's number one give number one a sip lickety split number two number two just as a reminder this one finally a win god damn this tastes like caramel this tastes like sadness it tastes like they just put a bunch of sugar in it here's number one so there's number one and two i think we got this one finally a win i don't really like either though but [Laughter] i'm gonna say three out of three i'm gonna say tj was just a little confused because the eggnog was on point that one was the best one nonetheless even if it was two out of three it's still a win grand total so but better starbucks part two the hot drink holiday edition [Music] you want to know what else gives you energy and happiness when ingested b-roll all right guys and that is it so we made our three holiday drinks hot latte versions of each they're all honestly relatively easy to make and i think if you really are craving something that has like a genuine properly conducted flavor then obviously making your own is the best if you are looking to just drive through a drive-through and pick it up then i'm sure there's many people who are going to comment and be like well doing this two minutes john it's like not really it actually takes like 30 minutes you drive like probably you know i don't know five to ten minutes out then you sit in line for five minutes and then you drive back for five to ten minutes so really when you weigh the time scale uh that argument's becoming less and less valid in my opinion i don't know i guess you could get it delivered the point is you can do whatever you want to do i'm not gonna try and force you to do anything but if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe

However, for this holiday season let's make it three different ways but also elevate it a bit and...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, is there really much to say about this it's chocolate it's chewy it goes in your mouth it's delicious but i think we can elevate it a step and make it a little fancier say a chocolatier version if you [Music] will [Music] okay so we're about to film another video but i have to say something really quickly very important and exciting announcement we have been featured on the burger show it is up now the link is in the description if you haven't seen it yet go down there and watch it me alvin kailan little homies making burgers so uh go watch it thank you okay so today we're making fudge now we're gonna do it three different ways we're doing a simple one that's ultra easy and we're gonna do a fancy one inspired by kind of like a french chocolate shop you got the hazelnut praline and all that stuff i won't get too far into it but the last one is a healthy version we'll see how it really stands up with the rest but with all that said let's make this shall we okay let's start with mr simple ultra easy plain fudge no candy making required start off with an 8x8 baking dish spray it lightly with oil add in some parchment paper to coat the bottom leaving some overhang on both sides then a medium sized sauce pot add 18 ounces or 500 grams of rough chopped chocolate this could be in the form of chocolate chips dark chocolate milk chocolate although i'd really recommend using 60 cacao dark chocolate then add 2 tablespoons or 28 grams of unsalted butter half a teaspoon or 4 grams of fine sea salt 14 ounces or 400 grams of sweetened condensed milk obviously i recommend making your own sweetened condensed milk which you can get the recipe from my pumpkin pie video finally add one and a half teaspoons or four grams of vanilla extract stir that all together set it over medium heat and let it heat while stirring often until completely melted and homogeneous don't overheat it now pour that into your prepared baking dish spread it out to the edges and let it sit in the fridge for three hours or overnight then all you gotta do is pop it out cut it into nice even squares and observe their lovely chewy and fudgy texture and yes after they've been cut they can absolutely be left at room temp they're delicious now next we're gonna get a little fancier hazelnut praline fudge first spread out one and a third cup or 175 grams of raw hazelnuts on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper place it in an oven set to 350 fahrenheit or 175 celsius for 10 to 15 minutes or until nicely toasted and their skins begin to come off now toss those brothers into a clean dish towel and rub together until most of their skins have been removed let those cool completely for about five to ten minutes then add them to a bag and beat them until you get a nice mix of fine and rough crumbles get a baking sheet and line it with silpat or parchment paper then in a medium saucepan add 2 cups or 430 grams of granulated sugar and half a cup or 120 milliliters of filtered water mix it together clean the sides of the pot and set that over medium high heat and bring to a boil then immediately reduce the temperature to medium and let that lightly boil you know sort of slightly above a simmer until it reaches a deep amber color then immediately turn off the heat and whisk in 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of unsalted butter then once it's combined add in your hazelnuts and stir together until very well incorporated now pour your hot praline all over the baking sheet spread it out nicely make sure it doesn't actually touch the pan itself or you'll enjoy the nightmare of cleaning that now let that cool completely until it's a beautiful hard candy like this it should be stiff and it should snap now break that in half and break that half into pieces pop it in a plastic bag beat it up yet again well would you look at that twice beaten hazelnuts my favorite until you get a medium crush looking something like this now for our fudge base we can keep that the same as before or you can candy make if you want but this is easier add the 18 ounces of chocolate although this time i used some nicer more expensive chocolate and i also replace the extract with one whole vanilla bean and then everything else is the same you mix it all together you melt down and then before you add your base to the pan stir in half the praline that's been crushed or more if you like then pour it into a prepared pan spread it out and cover the top with some additional praline because it looks nice and cute then pop it in the fridge to set then you slice it up and go to crunchy hazelnut praline town that almost has a fancy chocolatier quality to it okay i have one more and i never thought i'd say this but a healthier more nutrient dense with a vegan option fudge i know can't believe it here we are i did it because they yelled at me okay to make that you're gonna combine one cup of smooth peanut butter then whisk in a third cup of softened coconut oil that's the first my channel because i really hate it half a teaspoon of salt 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract a quarter cup of maple syrup or honey obviously not honey if you want it vegan all right don't hurt me with that bowl now whisk all that together until thoroughly combined add to a prepared pan same as before and then instead of the fridge now you're going to pop it in the freezer for two to three hours before slicing one thing i would note is if you leave it in the freezer too long it'll get too hard and it's more like snappy i'd recommend letting it come up to room temp a little bit before slicing once you've got your nice cubes let's see if the flavor will match up to the healthy quality or is it the other way around i don't know this is confusing to say you know what i mean i don't even want to eat this fudge anymore because it chipped my new knife this is the normal fudge look at these teeth marks if your fudge ain't making teeth marks you don't even have fudge i will say that it's very very sweet which fudge literally has to be that's what fudge is this is what shipped my knife so i hope that there's no metal in here because if i swallow it i'll die hazelnut praline fudge it has a very distinct sort of like sweet chocolatey flavor and then that intense crunchy nutty hazelnut last and definitely least rotation mark healthy sort of vegan fudge that's pretty good look at that because the coconut oil it's a little bit messy but flavor-wise i think i like this one the most aside from this i just wish i couldn't taste the coconut oil this is why i hate coconut oil see this is a problem there's a fudge for everybody here if you don't want to spend any time on it you just want fudge right freaking now you do this if you want something more special you do this if you want to make it healthy or vegan or whatever you do this one you get it you got it all right please enjoy i'm gonna go cry over this now what else is thick rich and chewy i was gonna say my but maybe that's too much [Music] one quick reminder do not forget to go check out the burger show that i was featured on it's up the description go there click it and watch the video all right guys and that is it so we made fudge three different ways easy fancy healthy now the healthy one actually was kind of good with that said i do feel like could have been better but for a healthy version not bad still high calorie but not quite as much sugar and it's got nutrients and blah blah blah blah blah if i was gonna pick one i probably would pick the fancy one oh look josh picked the fancy one what is it pies well the point is just that the healthy one i can just taste the coconut oil in it i don't know how i feel about it but if you're a fan of coconut oil you'll like it and if you want it healthy and you want it to taste good you'll still like it so with all that said if you

today we're gonna make a coleslaw that people will eat and desire every moment of their life so I don't think there's much else to say about that other than let's make this shall we Candace why does everyone want chicken right now what day is it Friday is for Holy it's not that good it is not this good I have to do this to make money and I don't even want to go send that if it isn't obvious my patience is being tested that is the coolest dog I would come just to see the dog can I get two uh box combos but no drinks thank you 1576 that was a good year it wasn't it was it was a bad that was a bad time you don't know what he wanted to be alive during then uh yes please thank you yes ma'am so we've got teens box got the Texas toast famous uh chicken doesn't look bad the sauce let's get a taste of the sauce real quick can't tell if there's MSG in that or not I have to figure that out got these fries who goes through the drive-through and you get this chicken tenders all right dip the chicken is heavily under season this one is the most under seasoned I've had from canes before it's Ultra dry and stringy like look how dry this is can you see that dry okay the sauce itself I don't know why people are so obsessed with this like it's good but it's not like mind-boggling not boggling bottling like your mind is in a bottle that's just sad Texas is this what you want to represent yourself with is this what you want to represent yourself with me nobody eats this it's disgusting but I'm gonna taste it anyway that wasn't the most viable thing we put in my mouth on this show that ruined everything at the end of the day this isn't that bad right it's not terrible I understand why people like it but it's so far away from really being good I think we'll take this one over now we can't start this without your precious cane sauce and look the recipe's already out there floating around the internet this is a slightly tweaked version in a bowl at three quarters of a cup or 150 grams of mayonnaise five tablespoons or 90 grams of ketchup one and a half tablespoons or 20 grams of Worcestershire sauce three cloves of fresh grated garlic one and a half teaspoons or five grams of salt kosha salt and fresh cracked black pepper to taste whisk all that together and put it in the fridge till you need it I will note that this tastes much more authentic if you let it sit for at least a few hours and ideally overnight right I don't know a single person that likes this law but you know what we're here to make that one of the stars of the show start with half a cup of mayo a quarter cup of Buttermilk one bunch of thinly sliced chives one clove of braided garlic a quarter cup of chopped pickled onions and yes I have a recipe for that link in the description the juice and zest of one lemon two grated carrots and two dill pickles that have also been been graded then just mix that all together and add in half a head of green cabbage that's been very thinly sliced season that the taste with salt and pepper and toss together until thoroughly combined I mean look at this a Sloss so gosh darn good you'll be slapping your name or something like that now let's talk chicken pendies look it's simple you need four chicken breasts cut them in half lengthwise like this fella right here then separately whisk together one and a half cups or 350 milliliters of Buttermilk one tablespoon or 10 grams of kosher salt one tablespoon or 10 grams of garlic powder and one tablespoon or 6 grams of ground white pepper do not skip the white pepper it's an iconic fried chicken flavor now once that's combined add in your chicken to its milky bath water cover it with plastic wrap and marinate for at least one hour or ideally overnight while that's marinating let's get our fries prepped yes we make our own fries let's go brother real simple you need two and a half pounds of russet potatoes peel them or don't peel them up to you just make sure you wash them then cut them into batons or just waste a bunch of money on this cool French fry slicer but would you look at that it came in handy didn't it anyway soak your potatoes in salted water for 30 minutes now while that's soaking let's go back to Frying our chicken in a medium-sized Bowl add in one and a half cups or 225 grams of all-purpose flour one tablespoon or 10 grams of kosher salt 2 teaspoons or 8 grams of garlic powder 2 teaspoons or three grams of paprika 2 teaspoons or 4 grams of ground white pepper whisk all that together until thoroughly combined next add your chicken to your flour toss together and press the flour into the chicken to make sure every surface is coated I know I say it all the time I want zero unflowered pieces on this chicken you got it buddy boy once all of your chicken is coated assuming you did it properly it should look like this with some nice flaky bits to it to get it frying fill a heavy bottom pot with about two and a half inches of frying oil like vegetable or Canola just be sure not to fill it over three quarters of the way up that's a fire heated to 350 Fahrenheit or 175 Celsius then fry your chicken in batches about three to four pieces at a time for five to seven minutes or until a deep golden brown and the inside is cooked through don't let your chicken sit in there forever right otherwise it's going to overcook it's gonna dry out real stuff and look at this beautiful flaky almost Angelic piece of chicken make Papa want to cry your fries should be ready to fry drain them from their water dry them thoroughly then lower your oil temp to 300 Fahrenheit and if it's too hot guess what you can just add a little bit of more oil and that'll immediately drop the temperature just frying facts for you today then in batches deep fry your potatoes for three minutes or just until they develop a skin and they're soft they won't develop color that's what you want remove from the oil drain over a wire rack set over a baking sheet and repeat with all of your potatoes increase the oil temperature to 400 Fahrenheit then fry in batches again until you get a beautiful golden brown like this about one to two minutes remove from the hot oil place in a bowl and immediately season with salt to taste then pour out onto your cooling rack repeat this with the rest of your fries remember to always season your fries when they're hot and fresh out of the oil gosh darn it otherwise none of the salt will stick and it'll be so sad I can't even describe it to you now for the most part we have our meal except one crucial piece that there Texas toast get a small pan and add half a cup or 112 grams of unsalted butter heat that over medium heat until melted turn off the heat and add one to three cloves of garlic grated swirl it around to incorporate and place to the side for the bread of choice I went with a nice crusty loaf of sourdough bread but you could also do brioche you know up to you slice that bad boy about one inch thick toasted in a pan with butter on both sides once it's toasted nicely brush it with garlic butter to my taste and finish it off with some flaky salt you know as we do around here at this point your house should smell magnificent and your plate is ready to be assembled in this order fries then your toast which has been sliced at a diagonal a Ramekin of your slaw a smaller Ramekin of your cane sauce and your luxurious fried chicken tenders look if Keynes wanted a spanking I have a feeling this plate might have just done that okay so we're done we got our chicken we got our fries the fries have been sitting for like two hours so no they're not crispy anymore but they would have been had we not sat fiddling around with this we got our coleslaw that is a coleslaw that I want to eat I took a jab at the Texas toast garlic butter flaky salt and bungee on the inside but on the outside oh chicken Jonas Chickie's really good I think it's like one of the best fried chicken I made so far somehow yeah I mean we obliterated here's my sauce sauce you know what shockingly similar almost identical actually except mine's better because it has the fresh garlic that's got some bitiness to it obviously the french fries would be crispy they're not anymore but they've both been sitting around the same amount of time if I were to try them both these are both cold fries and even in death mine wins which means that they're Immortals here's the Texas toast number one um texture aside I can taste the garlic on this one the garlic butter I know you don't like the coleslaw oh my God nobody eats it coleslaw uh I'm leaving that there for TJ tomorrow that's coleslaw number one that's really good there's so many flavors I know that one's yours don't say that well I need Hazard pay you don't have to do the whole thing oh it tastes like curdled milk you're dipped now give that a taste okay all right okay okay he really likes the sauce okay second second one's better I tasted a lot more than garlic they are very close like they both have the same hints of stuff surprisingly very very close chicken time yum yummy could this be Raising Canes hey buddy you're finding the metal this is a really good vehicle for the sauce the other one is kind of like when you put carrots and ranch and you're just gonna have it to have the the ranch nobody wants the carrots you want the ranch you want the ranch this this I want the carrots at the end of the day I don't think canes is the worst but better episode I don't know it's a lot of them dangan turned it up to 11. you want to know what else contains sloth that's actually worth something b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made canes chicken tender meal I mean look this was uh yet another pretty simple and easy one I'm not trying to flex I'm just saying that I think in general this is the type of recipe that you know you make a great buttermilk fried chicken you make a great sauce and lucky for us the sauce is already out there on the internet I just made some differences in the proportion you can use MSG if you want obviously that'll make it better but even without the MSG it's still gonna be better than theirs this is a win this is a big win it was a lot of fun it was delicious I feel sick after eating all that chicken but you know what I will go to sleep at night just fine farting or without farting but nonetheless

Turns out, I really think that homemade tamales are so easy that genuinely...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, i'm tired of people being like oh josh is too hard well i'm here to tell you this is easier than you think and it's unbelievably worth it [Music] okay so today we're making tamales it's happening it's finally time people have been asking about it over and over and over again which i'm surprised about because it's like why do you want this like random white dude to make tamales anyway we're gonna make this it's not as hard as you think we're gonna make tamales that's it all right let's make this shall we right so we're going to start this with my succulent meat like the filling for the tamales yanasti now snag yourself two pounds or 900 grams of boneless pork shoulder this is boston butt pat it dry with paper towels cut that into large two and a half inch cubes nice and evenly next add 3 tablespoons or 40 milliliters of high heat cooking oil to a 7 quart dutch oven or brazer not a brazier which is different heat that over medium high until screaming hot then add your pork and batches to avoid overcrowding the pan sear every piece on all sides for 2 minutes or until nicely brown like this right here repeat that with all of your pork and place to the side reduce the heat to medium and add a touch more oil to your pan if needed you know just enough to like coat the bottom then add in 1 sliced yellow onion and 4 cloves of sliced garlic season that to taste with salt and pepper and saute that for two minutes or until the vegetables begin to soften then add three bay leaves and one cinnamon stick stir that in then nestle all of your meat back into the pot evenly spaced apart along with any juices that collected on the side top that with two sprigs of fresh oregano and cover with five and three quarters of a cup or 1.3 liters of filtered water turn the heat up to medium high and as soon as it comes to a boil lower the temperature to low and cover with a lid and let that gently simmer for one and a half to two hours until the meat is extremely tender and pulls apart easily it should melt in your hand or wait no it should melt in your mouth not in your hand that's a wrap lyric it's fine if it melts in your hand too whatever now removal of your meat and only the meat try to avoid any veg getting in there then strain all the vegetables and herbs out of the broth and reserve the liquid now while your meat is still hot use two forks to shred it as finely as you can don't toss any of the fat leave it in there just shred that brother in don't be shy that melty pork fat is gonna mix in and emulsify and create something beautiful next de-stem and deseed three ancho peppers and three guajillo peppers if you want it spicier you can leave the seeds in or you can add something like habanero to this now place your peppers in a bowl and cover with enough of your hot broth from your pork braise from earlier just to barely cover the chilies press that down with plastic wrap to keep them submerged and let that sit for 5-10 minutes once your chilies are soft and easy to tear add them to a blender along with one and a half teaspoons of ground cumin this is toasted and freshly ground you know not the flex but and six cloves of fresh garlic begin blending that using your rehydration liquid just to loosen the blender once it begins to vortex nicely blend that on high speed until as smooth as possible if it stops vortexing add a little more liquid you get the point not too thick not too thin then drizzle in three tablespoons or 40 milliliters of a neutral tasting oil then once that's blended and emulsified season it to taste with salt now all you gotta do is add as little or as much of this stuff to your meat as you want i added around a half cup to my meat while i'm talking about my meat in this episode guys please all right stay calm tussle that together until thoroughly mixed and it looks like this sort of like a meaty ruby glimmering with pork fat in the distance now reserve the rest of your sauce for later we're almost there get yourself some corn husks you'll need 30 of them or so that's not very specific josh let's save 40 corn husks place those in a large bowl and cover them with boiling water and let those sit and rehydrate for about 20 minutes or until easily pliable in another bowl add 3 and a quarter cup or 395 grams of instant masa flour obviously fresh ground next to mall is better but we'll have a guide for that another time to that add one teaspoon or four grams of baking powder and one tablespoon or 14 grams of kosher salt whisk that together until thoroughly combined in a separate bowl add one and a third cup or 257 grams of room temp lard whisk that together vigorously really put some elbow grease into that until nice and creamy add in your masala flour mix and fold that together only to realize you should have gotten a bigger bowl as usual once that's incorporated add two and a half to three cups or 600 to 700 milliliters of your pork broth from earlier until it reaches the right consistency muscle flour is different depending on a lot of factors so just keep adding it until it looks something like this but don't overthink it buddy assembly is easy first take a couple of your dry corn husks and rip them into threads like this you'll use these to tie your tamales later then on a rehydrated corn husk mound a third cup of your masa mix onto that then using plastic wrap press that out until it's a nice circle about a quarter of an inch thick in the middle place a couple tablespoons of your meat in a nice line like this then fold one side over the meat release it a little and then fold the other side over that to squeeze those edges shut now once you've got a tube fold the bottom up and tie that with a thread of corn husk then either tamp the tops down or squeeze the top to close the masa around the meat now this is how i like to do it you don't have to tie them but i think it looks cute don't you want cute little tamales now all you need to do is fill a steamer pot with a half inch of water set a large steamer basket in your pot then bring that water to a simmer and begin steaming once that's going place some corn husks in the bottom and fill your pot with your tamales standing them up like this i added a ball of foil in case they didn't all fit which you can do but it turns out they fit perfectly so you know josh was right as always look at that then just cover your pot with a lid and steam your tamales for 45 minutes to one hour once your tamale is easily released from their husks they're done now all you need to do is enjoy these bad boys you can serve it with the chili sauce from earlier or you can make the jalapeno salsa for my breakfast burrito guide which i did do and that was very good now bust that husky open and go to town this uh didn't really roll off the tongue like i thought it would okay so we have our little parcel i mean look at him so cute i love you you roll it to unveil your little perfect little man i love him you don't really need a plate because the corn husk is your plate now give it a little break in half look at that let's give it a taste unadulterated without sauce first yes yes yes this already tastes like a classic it's not dry it's super moist yes i'm saying the word moist because this is moist you've got that rich melt in your mouth pork it's fatty it's salty it's spicy to kick it up a notch obviously we made a little bit of a jalapeno salsa here oh that's the finishing touch when you add a little bit of a jalapeno sauce or a pepper sauce it's so good that i have a lacquer where it's long story short these tamales are fantastic they're easy to make and you know what if you've never done it before this is something that you should be doing at least once a week once a month on the weekend family get together tamales from papa to you you want to know what else is ready to be bust open [Music] b-roll [Music] our guys and that is it so we made tamales from scratch well as close to scratch as we could aside from grinding our own masa from knicks to mall but these came out beautifully the pork was nice and rich and fatty it wasn't dry it wasn't chewy it just melts in your mouth it had a nice spice quality to it it was chili ford you know i couldn't complain also that jalapeno salsa was a perfect addition and the lights going on again so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time the sun's going away bye bye

Those ingredients are great but how about we take those classic ingredients, put them...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, so we know our classic breakfast eggs bacon toast bread but why not just take all of our favorite parts of a breakfast and put them in a tortilla to make the greatest burrito of all time [Music] okay so today we are making breakfast burritos but not just any breakfast burrito the perfect breakfast burrito the one that makes you call your mom and say hey come over because we have breakfast burritos that doesn't really it's something you got to call somebody about it because it's so good I don't know so we're gonna make three different kinds three different levels one of them will be a chimichanga style so with all that said let's make this shall we listen up really quickly I gotta say something the apron sold out in less than 24 hours I know a lot of you still want aprons so I just want to let you know that we've restocked them they are back very limited quantity this is the last run of it so if you do want an apron please get one now anyway thank you guys for the support and thank you so much for selling it out so fast it means a lot to me and I'm honestly pretty shocked by it so anyway on to the recipe all right let's start off with some Basics here first off tortillas if you've been around here long enough you know how I feel about store-bought papa says big no no make your own flower burrito size tortilla is extremely easy and I'm using the same recipe that's in my Chipotle burrito video link in the description for that it's simple you mix the dough you let it rest a little slap it around divide and roll it into burrito sized circles and then just pop them in a hot Skillet flip and that right there is a beautiful tortilla okay so we got tortillas but there's one more thing we gotta cross off the list before we jump into making and assembling these that is your lovely scrambled egg ah yes this is the internet's favorite thing to pretend that they know something about look a soft scramble would be nice but functionality wise it just won't do unless you want to fart out the other end we also don't want to overcook our eggs instead what I'd recommend is to do what I'll call a medium scramble form with functionality first start off with a non-stick skillet add in three tablespoons or 42 grams of unsalted butter place it on the stove over medium heat and once that butter is hot and boomlin crack eight eggs and whisk them together in a bowl until thoroughly come combined no salt yet now add your eggs to the pan and immediately begin stirring them as these cook you're essentially just going to continuously stir sometimes I'll let the egg sit for a few seconds and cook on the bottom then Stir It All In that's really all you gotta do just continue stirring and cooking over medium heat until they are just cooked through and hold together on a spatula but aren't complete rubber they should look like this then just season them to taste with salt and pepper and that is your scramble this will fill about four burritos now burrito number one is a classic bacon egg and cheese here I have some home cured and smoked bacon I made not too long ago but obviously you can go to the store and buy some I prefer making it because I can control the thickness but blah blah blah blah otherwise find the thickest bacon you can you'll need six to eight glorious slices I cut mine so thick that I decided to go ahead and slice it into lardons but you can also leave it whole in a single slice then just Place those bad boys on a foil and baking sheet and toss into a cold oven that's completely off close the door and set your oven to 450 Fahrenheit let those guys cook for 20 to 25 minutes or until beautifully browned and lightly crisp the other option would be to cook it in a pan if you prefer now to make a simple Pico get yourself a small bowl and add one large Ripe Tomato that's been diced one diced jalapeno you can leave the seeds in or leave them out depends on how spicy you want it half of a finely diced sweet onion a large handful of finely chopped cilantro and the juice and zest of one lime oh and a nice little glug of olive oil and salt and pepper to taste for the flex now give that a nice mix until thoroughly combined if you want to take it a step further you can also make a quick hash brown you'll need one to two large russet potatoes peeled completely grated on a cheese grater give them a little rinse underwater and then place them in a hand towel to wring out as much moisture as possible you want them dry then all you need is a medium sized Skillet coat it with enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan heat it over medium heat and once it's hot press in your potatoes let it cook for about three to four minutes then flip and repeat on the other side until cooked through and crispy on both sides now I bet that McDonald's hash brown recipe I made would also be dope now to assemble snag yourself a purdy looking tortilla put down a decent layer of your scrambled egg or as much as you like then hit it with your big old chunky bacon I don't know I'm feeling real Southern drawl today I'm around two slices per burrito some grated medium sharp cheddar and optionally you can melt this with a kitchen torch because culinary hype Beast top it with some of your pico de gallo and then layer on your hash browns to cover the entire thing almost like the roof to your house but potatoes now to channel your best burrito rolling skills roll that fatty up by folding in the edges while rolling it up from the bottom until tightly wound like this be careful not to tear it obviously once it's closed then just griddle that in a dry non-stick pan set over medium heat for about one to two minutes per side just to get the tortilla heated back up and lightly toasty then get yourself a lovely cross section and look at that hash browns cheese Pico cradled in a ring of velvety scrambled eggs okay so burrito number one look at that I mean this is just a picture perfect burrito this is the kind that you see at the gas station well that's not a very good comparison this is the artwork you see in the packaging at the gas station which is so perfect they have that perfect little cross section it's got like jalapenos bursting out but in reality nobody knows what it is toasted griddled homemade tortillas this is a very reminiscent moment of the breakfast sandwich video but in the form of it's all coming to me all the flavors that is fireworks babies singing the hash browns getting your gums so it makes it kind of hard to talk because then there's like a little hash brown like hey what's up chewy toasted tortilla the eggs are cooked perfectly they're salty and buttery and silky then you've got that like Classic Soft fluffy potato with a crispy outside hash brown and a little bit of some plants for nutrients and we can pretend that it's healthy because it has pico de gallo in it this is a beautiful breakfast burrito let's move on to the next one next burrito is a bit of a step up let's say sort of a steak and eggs meets the inspiration of a Philly cheesesteak uh emphasis on inspiration okay calm down Philly people all right it's not a Cheesesteak I know anyway let's start off with our spicy Mornay sauce which is just a fancy term for cheese sauce Begin by melting four tablespoons or 56 grams of unsalted butter in a medium saucepan set over medium heat once that's completely melted whisk in four tablespoons or 60 grams of all-purpose flour keep whisking and cooking for about 30 seconds then gradually whisk in one and a half cups or 350 milliliters of whole milk keep Heating and mixing and just until that's thickened then whisk in one and a half cups or 225 grams of grated gruyere cheese then just keep whisking until it's completely melted then turn the heat off and whisk in two and a half teaspoons of cayenne powder half a teaspoon of fresh grated nutmeg and salt and pepper to taste now just place it to the side and keep it warm for the peppers and onions it's simple heat a pan with 3 tablespoons or 42 grams of olive oil over medium-high heat then once that's ripping hot add in one sliced red bell pepper one sliced green bell pepper and one yellow onion also well sliced season that to tastes with salt and just cook for about seven minutes stirring and tossing occasionally until it's cooked through it's okay if you get a little bit of char I actually prefer that now last is our steaky boy I have tons of recipes for that in all sorts of places so I'm not going to get completely into it but it's real simple dry your steak season it generously with salt and pepper on both sides toss it in a screaming hot pan and sear it to get a perfect brown crust on both sides flip add aromatics baste repeatedly with butter just until it reaches medium rare rest the steak and cut it as thin or as thick as you like look at that beautifully medium rare I just want to kiss it or eat it now to assemble hit your tortilla with some eggs then your sliced steak a nice layer of your peppers and onions and a gen generous drizzle of your spicy cheese sauce wrap that up carefully because the cheese is a little runny and griddle it the exact same way as before and we can get a good look at the cross section look at that a perfectly cheesy steak breakfast so obviously we've got essentially a Philly cheesesteak breakfast burrito you guys say more oh wait hold up whoa I think we might have the show stopper here I don't think I've ever had a breakfast burrito this climactic and exciting to eat if the spicy cheese sauce which is essentially a morning sauce more Nay by the way and you've got that beautiful butter basted steak and the peppers and onions it's a Philly cheesesteak but then the eggs bring you to the front of the morning it's breakfast time we're enjoying our day with a cup of Joe and a Philly cheese steak burrito next one okay I've got one last option for you a breakfast chimichanga worthy of a kiss from Deadpool himself again assemble your burrito as before tortilla then your scrambled egg various fillings of choice here I had some seared ham lots of grated cheddar cheese some avocado flaky salt obviously a nice helping of Pico then roll that guy up nice and deut and get a large cast iron pan fill it with oil about one and a half inches deep heat it to 360 degrees Fahrenheit or 185 Celsius then carefully lowering your burrito seam side down and let it fry for one to two minutes per side or until crisp and golden keep flipping and frying the whole darn thing until it's perfectly crispy and browned or could be in the way yeah we haven't said that in a while so there you go that'll be a thousand dollars by the way then pull it out and let it drain on a wire rack set over baking sheet well that's cooling you can make an easy spicy Crema all you need is a quarter cup of sour cream a quarter cup of mayo two teaspoons of sambal one and a half teaspoons of smoked paprika salt to taste and two teaspoons of garlic powder mixed together till thoroughly Incorporated and I almost forgot you can add a teaspoon or two of your favorite hot sauce for some additional heat to assemble this guy simply plate up your chimney changa give it a nice drizzle of your spicy Crema top with a fried sunny side up egg some crumbled Cotija cheese some diced avocado arranged lovingly pickled onions because why not and finally garnish with fresh cilantro leaves my oh my she sticks the land look at this lovely creation but can we get a sassy cross section let's give it a shot the answer is yes I mean look at including the classy egg drip good God look at this body this is a chimichanga breakfast burrito a chimichanga a breakfast chimichanga the chimi mo Bamba this is gonna make your llama go whoa that's hamalama and nobody laughed I mean you've got the fried egg on top which like runs into the rest of it and then like the crispy exterior when I say crispy by the way I mean you understand we all have that one thing that we love to eat that we're not really proud to talk about I love tempura fried makimono the little sushi rolls rolled up and it's temper fried and crispy and like just oily and nasty but it's so good at the same time oh this is that in the format of a breakfast burrito with the pickled onions and the avocado and you have some homemade ingredients in this there is a freshness to it you won't feel horrible after eating this but it is so satisfying breakfast burrito winner I don't know you want to know what else is filled with copious amounts of breakfast dreams wound up into a voluptuous void of flour and fat b-roll [Music] foreign [Music] that is it so we made breakfast burritos three different ways we had our classic bacon egg and cheese a little bit of hashy brown wound in there and then we had sort of like a Philly cheesesteak inspired breakfast burrito and a chimichanga style breakfast burrito but let me rewind real quick a lot of people were like Josh that's not a Philly cheese steak what is that okay relax everybody from Philly gets so whenever someone uses that term it's just inspired by Philly cheesesteak in the form of a breakfast burrito that's all it is I want to just take a seat grab a bag and just breathe in it until your heart rate goes down because it's gonna be fine these three breakfast burritos were fantastic I was a big fan of each and every one you pick and choose your own adventure and which one you think will make you the happiest person alive with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and I will see you next also do I look like Lord farquaader I feel like I do with this new haircut it'll grow back up that's fine [Music] foreign

A homemade McRib, which is essentially just a rib sandwich isn't just doable... we can make everything from scratch and make it much much better.

Recipe: https://www.jos...",2022-12-04 21:59:44.386764, this is quite possibly the rarest fast food menu item in the world and it's back for a very limited time we're not gonna miss [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today is the day we are covering the mcrib hang on one second we're gonna get to the sandwich but with a video this important we have a very important announcement the winter collection merch drops today by the way vikram's editing this not me [Music] it's back i saw the news yes i keep my eyes peeled all right i see everything i don't miss anything but the mcrib all right well that's the subject we're talking about today this is one of those ultra cult foods because it's so rare i think it's been back like just a few times over the last like 10 years or something wild like that don't quote me on that because i'm not 100 sure but the point is it's basically a rib sandwich that's got barbecue sauce pickles onions and it's on like a hoagie style sort of bun thing shape right this recipe has been requested since the beginning of the butt better series so with all that said let's make this shall we okay fellas we're back at mcdonald's again wow it feels like just yesterday we were doing the hash brown and now this this is a special moment this is a little blip in time what if they don't have it yet i'm nervous oh it's there yo there's actually nobody here i thought there was going to be a big line i guess nobody actually cares hi uh can i get three mcribs oh my god i'm sorry thank you what the hell am i smelling stinky it smells like a creamy pickle is he already done damn i don't know they were that fast dog chill can a man inspect his mcrib we've got the bag why did they put the big mac bag they're supposed to give me the mcrib bag they didn't give me the mcgriff i've actually never had this before i'm kind of excited you're gonna say that this is what deserves clout this it's like it wants to talk or it's like been knocked out somebody like clocked this thing in the jaw and it's just like yummy is it bad no it tastes alright all i taste is barbecue sauce that is it there's a certain slimy quality to it it's a specialty item it tastes alright but i think that we need to make something that's actually worthy of the clout all right so to get things started let's discuss this almost hoagy-esque bread i decided to use sesame seeds instead of semolina to top these but that's optional and i just think it tastes better whatever let's start with a simple dough you'll need one and a half cups or 350 milliliters of lukewarm water around 95 fahrenheit or 35 celsius whisk in two and a half teaspoons or seven grams of instant yeast and let it sit at room temp for about 10 minutes in the bowl of a stand mixer whisk together three and a half cups or 525 grams of all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons or 7 grams of fine sea salt and 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of granulated sugar whisk that together until thoroughly combined now pop that brother on the stand mixer with the dough spiral attachment because i freaking hate the dough hook one start mixing that on medium low speed then add in your yeasty water juice stuff keep mixing that for three to four minutes or until you get a nice smooth elastic dough now while the mixture is still mixing go ahead and add three tablespoons or 42 grams of softened unsalted butter and you're gonna do that around one tablespoon at a time until all of it is added once the butter is incorporated fully and the dough is looking nice and homogenized fold it into a light bulb plop it into a greased bowl cover it with plastic wrap that's also been greased and give it a name that deserves respect then just let it rise at room temp for one to one and a half hours or until doubled now that your dough is all grown up and living a happy life punch all the air out of it place it on a lightly floured work surface and divide it into six even pieces and if you're neurotic like me you'll want each piece to weigh around 150 grams shape each piece into a light bulb by bringing in the sides to the center flipping it over so it's seam side down rolling it in a circular motion while maintaining constant contact with your work surface now once you have all your balls grab one of them and roll it into a six inch log pressing slightly harder when reaching the ends so that they look nice and tapered now once you've shaped all of your dough pour a quarter cup of sesame seeds onto a medium plate make sure they're nice and spread out in a separate bowl mix together one egg white and a splash of milk until completely combined then to coat your bread brush the top of your dough log with that egg wash carefully flip them over and roll the egg washed side around in your sesame seeds until nicely coated then place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and repeat that process with the rest of your dough then just cover that baking sheet with another rimmed baking sheet inverted of course and let them proof for 30 minutes as a side note i did use a second half sheet for the remaining two pieces of dough so i didn't risk them touching when baking but it's not a huge issue now while it's rising preheat your oven to 425 fahrenheit or 220 celsius then once your dough is proofed and the oven is hot get a nice razor lame or very sharp knife and score your dough lengthwise at a slight angle once each piece of dough is scored spray them lightly with water place them in your preheated oven spritz the walls of the oven with water not the glass window unless you want it to shatter that's up to you and bake for 15 to 18 minutes or until they emerge of a luminous beautiful golden brown then pull them out and let them cool on a wire rack until completely cool now let's talk ribs this can be done up to three days ahead of time you're gonna need a large rack of ribs either baby back or spare ribs i will say that baby back are a little easier to manage either way in a medium-sized bowl add one tablespoon of kosher salt two tablespoons of dark brown sugar two teaspoons of garlic powder two teaspoons of mustard powder two teaspoons of smoked paprika and two teaspoons of ground white pepper mix together until combined and before you season your ribs be sure to remove the membrane all right it's real easy just sort of finger your way under there then grab the edge of the paper towel and it should just kind of pull right off like that do not skip that all right it's not gonna cook just take it off then season your ribs all over with every last ounce of your spice mix rub it in nicely then lay your ribs on two large sheets of tin foil add a little splash of sherry vinegar if you like then tightly wrap it up so there are no leaks place it on a rim baking sheet and then into the oven at 300 fahrenheit for three to three and a half hours or until they're so tender that their bones just about fly right out when you move them now obviously while we're waiting for a ribs we should go ahead and make a barbecue sauce in a medium-sized sauce pot add one cup of brown sugar one cup of ketchup three tablespoons of blackstrap molasses a quarter cup of sherry vinegar one tablespoon of garlic powder one tablespoon of smoked paprika one and a half teaspoons of cayenne one tablespoon of worcestershire sauce one tablespoon of kosher salt and one teaspoon of fresh ground black pepper almost there now just mix all it together and place it on the stove over medium heat and simmer it for five minutes or until everything is dissolved and it's slightly reduced now optionally although worth it would be to cold smoke it with some apple wood chips like i did here i filled it with smoke covered it let it sit for 15 minutes repeated that two to three times or until smoky to your it you could also use liquid smoke but i didn't tell you that okay we're almost done once your ribs are ready and they're still hot carefully wiggle out and remove each and every bone until you have a literal boneless rack of ribs brush it generously with your barbecue sauce then use that piece of foil to carefully flip your ribs onto a foil-lined baking sheet and brush the other side with barbecue sauce you gotta be careful when flipping these because they will fall apart if you aren't and then you're gonna cry papa's gonna be mad it's not good then just pop that under the broiler for about two minutes or until the barbecue sauce is bubbling and caramelized give it one more brushing of sauce and broil one more time now we're ready to assemble slice one of your hoagies in half spread some softened butter on both of your cut sides and toast in a pan set over medium heat until well toasted very thinly slice some sweet onions and optionally you can place those in a bowl and give them a quick rinse with water that'll help remove some of their bite drain them well then as i've said many times before slice your pickles into lengthwise sheets like this these are dill pickles by the way then just get your toasted hoagie spread on some barbecue sauce cut your ribs so that they fit your sandwich properly then lay your portion ribs onto the bread top with your pickles shingling them across the entire sandwich and finally your sliced onions you can add additional barbecue sauce on top of that if you want then add the top bun to crown your king now that looks like a proper rib sandwich that anyone would slap their grandma after eating but also maybe don't do that alright i'm not advising you to do that don't ever do some of these things that i say it's a joke i mean come on look at this thing this or that all right that's all i got to say i cut it in half it might have done that if i had not cut it in half for the record that's ground meat this is a whole rib that we deboned ourselves it's juicy look at that you see catching that a little poopy on my nose come on do i really need to explain why this is better i shouldn't have to ah ah i'm speechless tender it's ribby it's salty it's rich it's fatty barbecue sweet i think if you wanted to finish this guy off with another like fat drizzle of barbecue sauce because i think that's what they do you could finish it off like that we needed our taste tester in here i ain't got nothing left to say no [Music] bigger i think i'm just going to feed you so you can't tell okay you have to open much wider than that man going with the first one i mean there's not really a competition here first one is just beautiful like the perfect bite this is a million times better on every front like they could make this a normal menu item it wouldn't have the height behind it yeah that's it that's the key they could make this a normal menu item there would be no height so anyway long story short mcrib butt better a legend will excuse me mcrib a legendary menu item for some reason taken by force you want to know what else got a rib based chin check don't forget about merch oh i know about to go to b-roll but i had to remind you it just dropped okay link in the description please please we worked really hard on this anyway back to b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made the mcribs sandwich and you know what we we did it we we more than did it for one it's already an automatic win with the homemade bread and the perfect ribs i mean that's the whole sandwich but it's already a win because we made those ribs out of actual ribs they're anxious succulent juicy fatty melt in your mouth this is a chin check for the mcrib and we we did it we did it and i feel very very good about it i couldn't be more happy let me know what you guys think how did we do let us know in the comments what else do you want to see on butt better it's been a while since i've asked you that and i'd like to ask you now i'm listening papa is always watching okay so just comment let me know you can dm me on instagram all that good stuff but anyway if you enjoyed this video or you

224,224,Perfect Shepherd's/Cottage Pie That Anyone Can Make,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zXQ9wX4cKlQ/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLCAK1xDPJSOSuyFmB_U6jk8LRdcYw,zXQ9wX4cKlQ,"8 minutes, 1 second","So to me, homemade shepherds pie is technically a casserole rather than a pie but that’s beside the point. Now, this is technically a cottage pie rather than a shepherd's pie since we're...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, so when people think of pie they think cherry pecan apple you name it this is a very special pie that in my opinion may just rise above those and the secret is that it's savory not sweet okay so today we're making shepherd's pie now i know many of you know this there's a bunch of different recipes online for it each of them being a little bit different but the goal of mine i wanted to be the easiest possible one that you can make that maximizes its flavor as much as possible that's my goal today and for those of you who don't know what shepherd's pie is it's basically a very basic meat mince filling which is then coated in mashed potatoes topped with cheese and broiled to crispy cheesy perfection so with all that said let's make this shall we okay so making shepherd's pie should be relatively quick and easy so there might be some room to make it a little extra special let's first start off with a simple mashed potato topping get yourself two and a half pounds or 1200 grams of russet potatoes give those guys a rinse and take off their little jackets and by that i mean you know peel them your joke jack you know it's like a jacket because yeah then cut your potatoes in half lengthwise then in half again lengthwise then cut across those two quarters to get roughly one inch sized cubes dump all of your potatoes into a medium sized pot add enough water to cover your potatoes season it generously with salt to taste and place it on a stove over medium-high heat now as soon as those reach a boil let them well boil for seven to ten minutes or until your potatoes are easily pierced with a fork but not you know complete mush now drain your tigers then in a separate small sauce pot add half a cup or 115 grams of unsalted butt er and half a cup or 120 milliliters of whole milk place it on the stove set to medium heat just until the butter is melted and the mixture is steamy hot now from here obviously you can mash your potatoes with a hand masher but for shepherd's pie you really want a fine mash that's why i like to use this potato ricer here which you can find in the links in the description then all you really need to do is toss in your cooked potatoes close the latch and push to get your tasty potato fluff poop stuff now repeat that until you've mashed all of your potatoes and from there you're gonna add your hot melty buttery milk mixture stir that in nicely then finish it with a third cup or 85 grams of creme fresh stir together again and lastly half a cup or 75 grams of grated gruyere cheese season that to taste with salt and pepper and mix until everything is thoroughly combined and you get a nice homogenized titer now to build the shepherd to your pie you must first choose your meat personally i like the ground beef version but it'd be a whole lot cooler if you ground it yourself so here i have roughly one and a half pounds of beef chuck roast which i sliced into nice long strips like you see here just a little easier to feed to your grinder additionally i also have about six ounces of a nice smoky bacon chopped into nice half inch pieces then just toss your beef and bacon together and simply run it through a meat grinder i really like this attachment that i have for my stand mixer it's like 50 bucks and it really gets the job done pretty quickly and if you want to grind your own there will be a link in the description for that otherwise you can just use pre-ground meat and papa will only judge you a little bit now once you've got your ground meat give it a nice kneading just like a piece of dough to emulsify it a little with the fat then get yourself a nice pan or medium sized pot heat that over medium high heat until extremely hot with no oil in the pan we want it nike add in your beef press it in and let it sit and sear for about three minutes then flip it like a giant burger patty to reveal a beautifully browned crust then repeat that on the other side now once you've seared both sides get a handheld masher and mash the beef to get it as finely as you can like you see here then let that continue to cook over medium-high heat now during this time you're going to see a lot of liquid come out then the liquid will evaporate and finally you'll be left with the fat that's good season it to taste with salt and pepper and let it fry on its own fat until it's nice and evenly browned yes there is a whole technique to cook ground beef beautifully now dump out all of your beef and place it to the side then add a tablespoon of butter to your pan heat it over medium heat until the butter is melted and bubbling then add 3 diced trumpet or 6 diced button mushrooms let those cook and sear just until they begin to brown then add 1 diced yellow onion 1 diced rib of celery 1 diced carrot and 4 cloves of sliced garlic season that the taste of salt and pepper and saute mixing occasionally for about two to three minutes or until the vegetables begin to soften nicely look we're making a casserole right not a puree so don't overcook the vegetables please now once softened toss in two tablespoons or 30 grams of tomato paste saute that for about two minutes or till it starts to caramelize on the bottom of the pot then deglaze that bad boy with half a cup or 120 milliliters of a nice red wine now look if you're a non-alcoholic type of person totally cool you can use additional stock with a splash of vinegar it's not the same but it's tasty and works just fine follow that up with two tablespoons or 30 milliliters of worcestershire sauce then bring that to a boil and add one tablespoon or five grams of fresh chopped thyme one tablespoon or six grams of fresh chopped rosemary then let that reduce until offset which is pretty much until almost all the liquid is gone then add one cup or 240 milliliters of beef stock season that to taste with salt and pepper let it cook for another minute or two to make sure everything's nice and hot and sweaty and finally the pista resistance 1 cup or 140 grams of frozen peas stir that together and let that cook just until the peas are hot now all you gotta do is dump your nice meaty pea mixture into a nice casserole dish something like a 9x12 spread it out evenly to the edges of the pan then press the meat down so it's nice and compact you really want your meat nice and tight then simply and gently lay on your mashed potatoes and evenly spread across the entire surface of your casserole once the entire thing is coated with a decent layer of potato go ahead and grate on half a cup or 75 grams of parmigiano-reggiano and half a cup or 75 grams of gruyere cheese don't be shy i don't want a skimpy little tiny bikini layer of cheese i want you to be sweating after grating this and optionally you can do the gordon ramsay thing and fork up the top of it then take that bad boy pop it in an oven set to 375 fahrenheit or 190 celsius for 20 minutes or until it looks freaking hot my guy i mean look at that it's just beautiful melty bubbling cheese a beefy boy just waiting beneath now one thing to note is that this is a little better if you let it sit for about 20 minutes before serving it'll hold a better slice and it won't be runny at all if you do that but none of us can wait and we have b-roll to shoot so cut it into a nice square place it on the plate top it with some chives which are pretty overused on this channel to be honest but you know whatever then just let this pie be your shepherd into flavor heaven we have here a beautiful pie of the shepherd now it is said that this dish was invented by one shepherd alone he had three sheep and i'm making this story up and i didn't think to think it through it's mashed potatoes on top of beefy yummy good there's a gummy like in another zone this is the perfect winter meal you get the pop and the sweetness from the peas within that rich anxious beefy flavor and yet it's not overly rich the potatoes help carry it through this is already sort of a nostalgic flavor profile i don't like that classic beef stew flavor but almost more exciting because you've got that cheesy potato it's a little crispy on the top the potatoes are smooth and creamy and just makes sense but it's a one casserole type thing where you have the whole meal in a single dish you scoop it out you put on your plate and that's the meal if you want to put extra with it that's fine but this already tastes like a perfect complete meal do you want to know what else is really just a casserole and not exactly a pie in my opinion [Music] b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made shepherd's pie it's a it's a basic thing to make you saw how easy it was you get some ground beef a little bit of bacon you saute it you got veg you got a little bit of tomato paste red wine it's delicious you're gonna be glad that you did it and uh and papa's gonna give you a kiss at the end so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] you
225,225,Making Butterfingers At Home | But Better,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dWWNUAaArOA/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBBdcPNs1vsr5AhRCN6IJjc58Wfpg,dWWNUAaArOA,"9 minutes, 37 seconds","Butterfinger candy bars seem like an impossible job to make at home. Right? Well.. turns out they’re actually kind of easy. Might go as far to say that they may even be… better.

Recipe:...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, there are only like two or three candies in the world that i think are the best and not only is this one of them but i think we can do much [Music] [Applause] [Music] better [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today we're talking about obviously butterfingers some people gonna be mad about this i know that there's all sorts of ongoing lists on the internet of this candy bar is better than this one blah blah blah blah blah blah whatever it doesn't matter point is butterfingers are one of my favorites it's one of my mom's favorites and i know many other people who love them this is a candy bar it's not quite as simple as some chocolate and some caramel and maybe some peanuts they have some sort of like a praline but it's layered and it's crispy and it's crunchy but it's also smooth and soft at the same time i don't know i think i would consider this to be an imperfect candy bar there's all sorts of things that are wrong with it it sticks to your teeth and it's too sweet and the chocolate doesn't taste like chocolate the list goes on and on but i'll go taste it and then we'll figure out what it's like so with all that said let's make this shall we so we've got the bar a little more anti-climactic than our typical drops so oh this is already broken in half classic there's always some 12 year old that goes through the convenience store and breaks all the butterfingers if you're watching stop it stop i've never really looked at the inside of one of these and i gotta say it looks pretty gross why is it orange shouldn't it be yellow since it's peanut butter let's do this i can't rag on these they do taste pretty good but they are sickeningly sweet i think this is gonna be a challenge for us honestly i'm not sure how it's gonna go but uh i think we can find out right about now so the time has finally come for buddy fingers yeah you like that one probably not they're surprisingly easier than i thought they'd be so let's begin with our peanut butter stuff first in a very large bowl add one and a half cups or 415 grams of smooth unsalted peanut butter add one teaspoon or seven grams of fine sea salt and whisk that together until thoroughly combined now i know this bowl looks a bit large but trust me you want mixing room next snag yourself an 8x8 baking pan spray it with oil to coat all sides and then press in a sheet of parchment paper leaving enough length for some overhang like this we all like a little overhang am i right folks am i right whoa stupid sorry now to make this even easier we're gonna make a honeycomb candy as the base of this to do that get a medium sized sauce pot this one is about four quarts then add in 1 cup or 210 grams of granulated white sugar 2 tablespoons or 34 grams of maple syrup half a cup 165 grams of corn syrup by the way if you don't want to do maple syrup you could just do all corn syrup plus the granulated sugar of course finally add in a quarter cup or 60 grams of filtered water place it on the stove give it a little mix to combine then turn the heat to medium high pop in a candy thermometer and let that bad boy get up to a nice boil now during this time i might fluctuate the heat down a little if it's coming up too fast or boiling too vigorously depends on your stovetop now once that mixture is boiling and has reached around 240 degrees fahrenheit or 115 degrees celsius pop your bowl of peanut butter into the oven and set the oven to the lowest temp possible we just need to warm up the peanut man a little bit now let your sugar mixture continue to simmer and once it reaches 285 degrees fahrenheit or 140 degrees celsius turn the heat off of your sugar syrup use pot holders carefully remove your peanut butter from the oven and separately in a small bowl mix together one and a half teaspoons or four grams of vanilla extract and half a teaspoon or four grams of baking soda then pour all of that mixture into your sugar syrup and immediately stir together vigorously now keep in mind that when you do that it will violently aerate and boil so be careful and make sure there's enough room now as soon as it does that quickly scrape your honeycomb candy into your peanut butter and fold that together over and over and over until thoroughly combined now keep in mind that it will not become completely homogeneous and it's gonna look a little thready like this which is good you want that just don't overwork it by mixing it too long now once it's looking good and starts to stiffen up immediately pour that mixture into your prepared 8x8 pan and gently press it out to the sides to evenly fill out the pan let me be extra specific make sure it is spread evenly this isn't a collection of mountains it's a butterfinger base now set that guy to the side to cool for one to two hours or until completely firm and cool once your filling is ready carefully lift it out of your baking pan place it on a cutting board now i'd recommend being precise here they're gonna look much better if you are get a ruler and mark cuts that are about one to one and a half inches apart then using a very sharp knife make scores across the entire surface following those markers try to keep these cuts as straight as possible then carefully cut across each and every one of those scores and by the way don't just press your knife straight down you're gonna want to do some sawing to prevent it from crumbling or breaking you should get a total of six to eight lovely long boy bars like these now you can either leave them ultra long like this which look cool or you could cut those in half for more individual servings up to you now we just need to enrobe these with chocolate which of course you're going to need to melt and temper first oh man everyone's getting scared now tempering chocolate oh god please have mercy josh don't worry i saw an easier method floating around on the internet that actually works quite well not as perfect as traditional tempering but saves you enormous time you're gonna need around 650 grams or one and a half pounds of chocolate dark or milk i used 60 cacao then you're gonna chop it into fine little shavings like this and i'm talking real real fine then just turn it and cut it in the opposite direction as finely as possible to get the finest chopped chocolate you can run your knife through it a few times the finer the better now place three quarters of that chopped chocolate into a heat proof bowl and place it in the microwave trust me i know it's a big culinary no-no but it has to be done for science and ease of use now microwave that at 50 power for 15 second intervals stirring in between each interval then just rinse and repeat that process until the chocolate is completely melted at that point you're then going to stir in the rest of your remaining chocolate that sounds redundant and it should melt completely at that point or at least 90 of the way there if it didn't fully melt then microwave it for no more than five more seconds at 50 power stir again and you should have a fully melted and relatively stabilized tempered chocolate it's weird but it works okay now we're ready to finish these guys off line up baking sheet with ideally a silicone mat link in the description or alternatively some parchment paper now place two long skewers on top of your bowl rottweiler spaced a little over an inch apart and then for the smaller bars drop them into your chocolate gently turn them over to coat each side and please be careful not to break them okay or papa's gonna come in and give you a little spank and you're not gonna like that one trust me then using a fork transfer them onto your skewers spoon a little extra chocolate on top and then using a spatula gently smooth out the tops don't press down a bunch we just want the tops to be smooth and flat then using a fork transfer to your silicone mat and repeat this process with the rest of your butterfinger failures this is going to take some practice it's not like you're gonna get it right on the first try but it's really not as hard as it looks i promise now for larger bars it's the same concept you're just gonna have to spoon to coat them in the chocolate rather than dropping them because they're a little bit too delicate to be dunked now once you've coated all of your bars and chocolate as is tradition around here give them a nice generous pinch of flaky salt along the entire length of the bar then just let them cool completely which will take around two to three hours and you should be left with a tempered chocolate perfect butterfinger bar now once your butter fingers are solidified you can trim the edges to make it nice and squared off like this guy now for storage you can leave them in an airtight container at room temp for a few days or in the fridge for a few weeks and i mean just look at these they're like gorgeous little glistening cigars started with sparkling diamonds awaiting to be consumed and the inside i mean speaks for itself you got the quit bitty quantity and it just it just looks actually looks quite similar so despite the fact that these are ready to be loved and kissed or something like that i don't know let's give these a little taste test so it's come down to this pretty proud this worked out as soon as i realized that a honeycomb kind of crunch would work well for this i knew honeycomb peanut butter hope that works and it did i think chocolate is tempered pretty well i would say make sure that you dip your chocolate at the right time if you dip it right away you're going to get a little bit of sort of stripy you know not proper tempering let it cool just for like a few minutes before you start dipping now salty crunch we did it we did it the texture it needs to be crunchier it's a little softer it's more flaky like a croissant the sweetness is perfectly balanced with the chocolate and the peanut butter it's salty it's rich i think we dang gun did this one brother but we have a special taste tester in the house but our fingers are her favorite it is my mom yay the mom is back number one don't be shy and there's number dos pink and chew just one the flavor is more peanut buttery oh you can take this off crispy you chose mine that was good it's delicious it has been decided by the mom the butterfinger fanatic has spoken and we've won this war yet again we can't stop it won't stop [Music] you want to know what else is long appears to be coated in chocolate and should be immediately consumed [Music] b-roll all right guys and that is it so we made butterfingers but better it was uh simpler than i thought it would be honestly i'm not trying to flex i'm just saying that it really is that simple you make the honeycomb candy you mix it with the peanut butter you put the chocolate on top somehow it just works the only key i would say is make sure to temper your chocolate properly i've told you many times before and i will say it again the point is if you've never made a candy bar before this is where you start and i'd be more than happy to be the shepherd to your chocolate bar dreams so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] you

First off, please no more thanksgiving leftover turkey sandwiches. We have 4 of the best thanksgiving...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, ah thanksgiving leftovers something that uh i think usually people miss the mark on and today we're gonna hit that mark okay so today we're talking about thanksgiving leftovers i know there's a bunch of thanksgiving recipes out there for leftovers but nine times out of ten it's like a sandwich with mashed potatoes and cranberries enough is enough we don't always have to just do that there are other options it just requires a little bit of technique a little bit of creativity and the urge to not waste ingredients which hopefully you're in that boat so with all that said let's take a little adventure and make these shall we all right so naturally when you're dealing with thanksgiving leftovers you'll probably land on breakfast first i've got a really easy one savory stuffing waffles so obviously you'll need some leftover stuffing three cups or 470 grams to be exact now just crush that up with your hands crack and beat together two whole large eggs until evenly mixed separately obviously then grate one cup or 85 grams of some nice parmigiano-reggiano into your stuffing add your eggs oh and don't forget to season with salt anyway mix until thoroughly incorporated from there all you have to do is heat up a waffle iron spray that guy with cooking oil and look if it's really big then this is only going to make one giant waffle for the record add your stuffing mix to your preheated waffle iron close it and let it cook checking intermittently until you get a beautifully crisp and golden brown waffle i mean look at that that's it i mean that's pretty much it all you gotta do is plate it up top it with a nice hot fried egg drizzle that with some leftover gravy don't go skimpy here put a lot then hit it with some fresh cracked black pepper and enjoy in its beautiful simplicity i just realized that we forgot to do a yolk uh runny yolk part so that's okay we'll just do it right here okay there are you happy of all you people who fetishize egg yolks you nasty nasty people you're literally just pressing it into a waffle iron gravy on top it makes a whole lot of sense to me i swallowed an air bubble oh oh god okay i'm better vikram just has to like watch me break down people always have a ton of leftover stuffing because it's just not the main event and if you have any leftovers whatsoever this is the way you should handle it all right next let's talk leftover turkey more specifically tom kagai or tom katurki i guess snack yourself a nice medium-sized sauce pot add two cups of turkey stock or chicken stock get one to two stalks of lemongrass bruise that guy up and rough chop it into evenly sized pieces rough chop six thai chilies slice a three inch knob of galangal if you can get it you can also sub ginger because i'm assuming a lot of you might not be able to find that and last you'll need five kefir lime leaves which unfortunately i lost the ones that i had in the freezer so you can totally sub like three or four regular lime peel from an actual lime not the same but it'll add a fragrant element that's reminiscent of kefir and last two shallots rough chopped as well add all that to your broth bring that up over medium high heat just until it comes to a boil and then immediately reduce to low and gentle simmer for about 12 minutes then straighten out all of the solids add your fragrant broth back to the pan bring it back up to heat and add six dried shiitake mushrooms and one pack of straw or hot chimeji type mushrooms let that simmer stirring occasionally until the shiitake are rehydrated and the hanshimeji are cooked through you can also use button mushrooms from there just mix in one can of full fat coconut milk and season it with 1 tablespoon or 15 grams of palm sugar or light brown sugar 3 tablespoons or 45 milliliters of fish sauce and 3 tablespoons or 45 milliliters of fresh lime juice mix all that together until thoroughly combined finally shred or chop up half a pound of leftover turkey meat that could be breast or thigh whatever you like add it to your hot soup and let it sit for about five minutes or until everything is nice and hot taste your broth and adjust seasoning with fish sauce lime juice and sugar you really want to balance this out right it's all about balance with this it should be a nice funky salty with heavy acidity and a light sweetness in the background anyway pour your broth with its veggies and meat into a bowl top it with some crispy shallots a lovely generous drizzle of chili oil and some nice fresh cilantro leaves and that is how you treat leftover turkey so essentially we've got a tomka guy here except it's with turkey so i guess it's a tom and kirky palm kakerki tomka turkey there we go that's what this is so inspired by tomka guy you got the lime juice the fish sauce the chili oil all these different sort of perfectly balanced flavors oh man oh god i i breathed it i messed it up it was so good i just started inhaling it and it went into my throat and my windpipe this calmed me down this soothes my soul i feel like i'm in a meadow i'm just kind of walking with a slight sway in my hips holding in but a small fart this is so shockingly easy to put together if you can find the ingredients this is so worth it and so satisfying especially for the time of the year you use up your loved or turkey and this is really just as good as any other tomka guys just got a little bit of a turkey plang to it yet another item of our thanksgiving meal refreshed now i know i said i was gonna avoid a sandwich but i couldn't stay away from a beautiful thanksgiving croc monster monsieur yeah you know we know how it goes when i try to pronounce so to make this start off with a small sauce pot and add 3 tablespoons of 42 grams of unsalted butter heat that over medium heat then once that's melted add in 3 tablespoons or 28 grams of all-purpose flour whisking occasionally for about one minute then slowly whisk in one and three quarters of a cup or 437 milliliters of whole milk keep whisking constantly and heating until that's nice and thickened then add one and a half cups or 120 grams of grated gruyere cheese keep whisking the heating until it's completely and totally melted then turn off the heat and whisk in half a cup of leftover gravy if you have it and season it to taste with salt and pepper and a small pinch of fresh grated nutmeg if you got it now get yourself two slices of bread and add any leftovers you want in there anything you want here i added some nice grated cheese melted that a little with a torch for the culinary hype beast moment some leftover roasted butternut squash some thanksgiving turkey breast a nice generous drizzle of gravy some mashed potatoes on the other slice some more cheese then crown your king get yourself a pan add in a little knob of butter and heat that over medium heat until the butter is melted and bubbling add in your sandal and toast it beautifully on both sides should be about two to three minutes per side once that's nice and toasted place it on a foil lined baking sheet cover the top with your creamy mornay cheese sauce you made a fatty grating of extra gruyere cheese and pop that bad boy under the broiler until the cheese is melted about two to three minutes then take your absolute unit of a sandwich slice that brother in half and watch a cheese pull that'll make you notice that you ain't never seen two pretty best friends when you take that first bite that's a stupid tick-tock reference i don't know so we have a sandwich but not just any sandwich we've got essentially a shoe at this point i'm not even gonna try to pronounce things correctly because if i if i don't try you get mad at me if i do try you get mad at me if i joke about it you get mad at me so really what i've learned is you just got to be yourself sometimes cheesy yummy boy sando this is inspired by a crocodile you could add a fried egg and turn it into that of madame and it's still cheesy i took a bite and the sun went away this sandwich hit me like the kroc mushroom the crocodile those two sandwiches a beautiful creation a beautiful simple french creation in my opinion one of the top three sandwiches of all time but this fits the bill and you can use up any of your thanksgiving leftovers just in this sandwich and then covered in mornay sauce and cheese if that's not wrong then i don't know what's right okay so i saved the best for last fried potato balls which are million times easier than you might imagine in a bowl add 3 cups or 750 grams of leftover mashed potatoes along with 1 cup or 95 grams of grated gouda cheese 1 bunch of thinly sliced chives salt and pepper to taste mix that all together and then remember that you actually completely forgot the bacon so separately get three thicky slices of either bacon or pancetta rough chop that into chunks then cook in a pan over medium heat stirring occasionally until you get beautifully browned little crispy bits of bacon drain that out of its fat place your crispy meat on a board and rough chop until you get fine little pieces add that to your mashed potato mixture and mix that together until well incorporated finally roll those bad boys into evenly sized 2 inch balls remember to always keep your balls even no matter what now once you have your balls of mashed potato whisk together two whole eggs in a small bowl and in a separate bowl add about one and a half cups or 180 grams of panko bread crumbs or as autocorrect likes to say panic breadcrumbs for each ball you're gonna roll them in the egg coat the entire darn thing don't get stingy here then take your egg coated ball and roll it into the panko breadcrumbs completely coat every single side leave no wet spots then rinse and repeat the process with all of your mashed potato balls until each and every one of them are coated beautifully get yourself a pot fill it with about three inches of high heat cooking oil like canola then heat that oil to 375 degrees fahrenheit or 190 degrees celsius once that reaches temp drop in about five to six balls at a time and fry for two to three minutes or until they are nicely browned and crispy like this guy right here immediately remove from the oil fish them out using a spider place them on a wire rack set over a baking sheet to drain and cool down a little bit and of course repeat with the rest of your balls now before we serve these we can also make a quick little spicy cream by combining a quarter cup of sour cream a quarter cup of mayonnaise two teaspoons of smoked paprika one tablespoon of sriracha and a tablespoon of spicy chili crisp oh and of course a little bit of salt to taste whisk all that together until thoroughly combined spoon some of that lovely spicy sauce in a small ramekin and get to dipping and flipping now next we have sort of like a croquette it's a fried potato ball mashed potato ball so you dip it a little bit of that sauce oh my god why was my deep so voiceless now or my voice so jeep just now this is something else first off you hear the crunch this has been sitting for an hour i cannot think of a better way to treat leftover mashed potatoes okay i'm tired of the whole like oh well i'll just reheat them and that's it fine that's easy but whoa you've already got half the work done for you you just got to mix something put it into this and then put it in the oil and fry it and get crispy delightful little balls of they're perfect oh you did something you get the best shot you really kind of have to have your back like this that's me all day yeah you wanna know what else is full of big holiday birds and plump mashed potato balls b-roll all right guys that is it so we made thanksgiving leftovers now i broke this up into a couple different parts you can obviously mix and match here but the point that i'm trying to make is you can be as creative as you want with these leftovers you already have a bunch of cooked ingredients don't just like throw them together in a sandwich you already have half the work done maybe you never wanted to make tomca guy because you didn't want to cook the chicken and then shred it in this and that but you already have the turkey cooked so now all you got to do is make the soup bake so you already saved yourself half the time guys take advantage of this moment please please i feel very passionate about this i'm tired of the turkey sandwich thing anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something

227,227,A Whole Thanksgiving Dinner for 35 Dollars | But Cheaper,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zlvvJI2NWTA/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAsPAFixDoOpjmjUplSA9YOW1xMgQ,zlvvJI2NWTA,"11 minutes, 55 seconds","Homemade Thanksgiving dinner can definitely get pricey, but I think we can make an entire Thanksgiving meal that serves 10-15 people for 35 dollars or less. 

Cody's Video: https://youtu.be/ZE7BYIu...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, thanksgiving dinner can be cheap or expensive but oftentimes it ends up being expensive because you buy more than you need but i think that we can make it for less than 50 and that is much [Music] i feel like personally i spend a ton of money on thanksgiving but supposedly the average is 50 for a 10-person meal that's not true there's no way that that is true every time i have thanksgiving for 10 or 15 or maybe even 20 people it's gonna be well over a 500 marker marker potentially into the thousand dollar marker because we're buying tons of butter and nice ingredients and yada yada yada yada the point is it can be cheap or can be expensive but we're gonna look at the cheapest possible way to make the nicest thanksgiving that we possibly can for this price so with all that said let's make this shall we really quick before we start the video i just want to remind everybody to go to the link in the description and watch cody ko and i's collab we ate pie we had fun it was great i showed him how to cut a slice of pie because he could use some work on that there will be a link in the description for his episode of sweet tooth so go check that out and we have a couple other videos together coming soon okay so a couple things to note you might have a smaller thanksgiving than usual which makes sense so this will account for about 10 to 15 people let's first talk turkey believe it or not i got mine for seven dollars because i bought it early and i bought it frozen which usually gets you a pretty insane deal otherwise it'll be around 17 so get your plump boy out address him of course and save the turkey neck that is uh a neck it looks a little funny but uh it that's a neck okay get your mind out of the gutter please now using good kitchen cheers very specifically good otherwise this will happen which is sad then you're gonna cut along both sides of the turkey's back to carefully remove the spine like this save that as well then take your turkey place it cut side down arrange the legs and press firmly on the breast to flatten the bird you've now spatched cocked yes that's a real term you're turkey instead of going back and buying stock just for gravy take the turkey neck and the spine place it in a pot along with one rough chopped onion one rough chopped carrot and one rough chopped rib of celery cover it with six cups of water or enough to completely cover the bones whichever comes first then place it on your stove over medium high heat and as soon as it comes to a boil reduce to low and let it simmer for three hours and once it's done just strain out all the vegetables and meaty bits so that you've got a lovely turkey stock okay so what about bread if you want the good stuff it's gonna cost you so instead i made my dinner roll recipe which is extremely cheap very very easy to make and well just feels good brother all you gotta do is rise the dough punch it down shape it place it in an eight by eight container proof it bake the brother hit it with a fat d of melted butter and finish it with flaky salt i mean it's a beautiful thing beautifully perfect and they cost a grand total of bada bing diss right here that's pretty good for a fine bakery style bun most cranberry sauces are usually as tasty as they are expensive and by that i mean they're cheap and they make papa sad so if you just use fresh cranberries you'll have a much nicer time in a medium-sized saucepot add one 12-oz package of fresh cranberries one cup or 130 grams of granulated sugar half a cup or 120 milliliters of filtered water and finally the zest and juice of one orange you can also use lemon if you prefer place it on the stove over medium-high heat stirring occasionally until it comes to a boil then reduce the heat to low and let that brother simmer for about 15 minutes or until thickened and syrupy then just let it cool completely and yes that's it you have a lovely perfect cranberry sauce now we've got stuffing or well dressing i don't know i find this argument to be very annoying oh josh it's not stuffing unless it's stuffed in the orifice of a bird blah blah blah it achieves the same thing really anyway i'm off my soapbox i'm sure people can get mad at me about that this is a perfect recipe where if you have leftover bread like i do then you're in a good spot to save a ton of money either way you'll need two large loaves of bread ideally sourdough it can also be a mix of two kinds like you see here then slice both of those loaves into 1 inch neat cubes give it a light drizzle of olive oil place this all on a baking sheet and place it in the oven set to 350 degrees fahrenheit for 15 to 20 minutes or till toasted and dry dump that into a large bowl and set to the side in a medium sized sauce pot add three quarters of a cup or 168 grams of unsalted butter heat that over medium heat until melted and bubbling then add five finely diced shallots three ribs of sliced celery and four cloves of rough chopped garlic season that to taste with salt and pepper and saute just until those guys start to soften then add 1 tablespoon or 6 grams of fresh chopped sage and 1 tablespoon or 4 grams of finely chopped fresh thyme along with a handful of finely chopped fresh parsley stir and cook until fragrant about 20 more seconds then add one cup of turkey stock or chicken stock if you didn't make it and you're trying to make me upset bringing it up to a steamy heat then pour that all over your toasted bread toss together until thoroughly combined now separately whisk together one more cup of stock and two whole eggs until thoroughly combined pour that over your bread and toss together once more then spray a 9x13 baking dish with oil add in all of your soaked bread and place in an oven set to 350 degrees fahrenheit or 175 celsius for 35 to 45 minutes or until cooked through and the top is beautifully browned and crisp that layer is a classy looking dressing with a bit more of a sophisticated flavor now the main event mr redundant thanksgiving turkey look i'm tired of it but we're doing it anyway start off with a medium-sized bowl and add three quarters of a cup or 168 grams of unsalted softened butter one and a half teaspoons of msg yes we're doing that one and a half teaspoons of kosher salt and three cloves of freshly grated garlic mix that together until thoroughly combined and you've got a garlic msg butter wield its massive power with great care and responsibility oh yeah now season your turkey generously with salt and pepper take half that butter and rub it all over your turkey really give your bird a nice little massage a sort of papa style massage i also like to put a little bit underneath the skin as well so it coats the meat while roasting normally i would place this on a wire rack set over a baking sheet to roast but for some reason i tried to fit it in a roasting pan with vegetables and well long story short if you do that it's going to take way too long for your bird to cook so i'd recommend a baking sheet instead so air can circulate around it anyway pop your turkey in the oven set to 450 fahrenheit or 232 celsius for 50 to 60 minutes or until the skin is a gorgeous golden brown and the deepest part of the turkey clocks in at around 165 fahrenheit let your bird rest for at least 20 minutes then carve it up and slice the meat into nice even pieces now for vegetable sides i actually prefer to toss this into the oven while the turkeys still roasting but either way get yourself one to two large butternut squash peel them all the way down cut their bottoms and tops off then cut that big filler in half remove all the seeds also known as the part that made us gag when we were kids i know you know okay if you know you know then just cut your butternut into nice even one-inch cubes like you see right here place them in a large bowl toss with enough oil to coat them season the taste with salt and pepper i actually really like these with a nice curry seasoning this one is a vodafone spice blend toss together again until evenly coated and seasoned now dump them onto a full-line baking sheet place in an oven set to 450 fahrenheit or 232 celsius for 30 minutes or until cooked through and lightly caramelized separately i do the same process with green beans get yourself one and a half to two pounds of green beans hit them with a nice glug of olive oil season them with salt and pepper to taste and obviously any other seasonings you want and roast at the same temp but this time for only 20 minutes or until nicely cooked with a little bit of snap left in them then just finish them with some lemon juice and flaky salt optionally so for your mashed titers it's real simple go ahead and peel two and a half pounds of a nice starchy potato like russet yukon golds also work fine cut them into one and a half inch cubes that are ideally nice and even toss them in a nice pot cover them with water season that water generously with salt then just boil those guys for about 10 minutes then drain your potatoes through a colander or a mesh sieve and place them back in the original pot that they were in in a separate saucepot add half a cup of unsalted butter and half a cup of whole milk set that over medium heat and let that heat up until the butter is fully melted and the mixture is nice and hot using a handheld masher crush and mash up your potatoes as fine as they'll go then add your milky butter mixture mash that in nicely then mix in a third cup of sour cream from there just season your potatoes with salt and pepper make sure your potatoes are seasoned nicely optionally you can add chives here too now right before the turkey is served you'll need to make your gravy it's really so much easier than people realize please make your own in a medium saucepan heat three and a half tablespoons of unsalted butter over medium heat then once it's completely melted whisk in three and a half tablespoons of all-purpose flour then just keep cooking and whisking for about 30 seconds just to cook out some of that flour then slowly whisk in two and a half cups of your turkey stock which is free it's free real estate what can i say keep whisking and heating until it thickens and you'll have a lovely gravy then just season it to taste with salt and pepper and optionally you can add some chopped herbs like fresh chopped thyme or whatever you're feeling what's the herb vibe today really and that is gravy now look i know what you're thinking josh what about pie well for one pumpkin pie isn't just the most common choice but it's also one of the cheapest options as well i use my pumpkin pie recipe which uses real pumpkin and obviously you can find that on the channel here or in the links in the description look at me always reminding you to tell you guys ago in the link in the description oh my gosh the plug now what we have in front of us here is a feast fit for a king well a frugal one but nonetheless he'd do be eating kind of good though for this price don't think he can beat it so this is butt cheaper at night we had all this made for the measly price said right here grand total that's not half bad i think we did a pretty darn good job it comes down to simplifying the menu and just using technique to make things taste great without a multitude of ingredients without further ado the thing that makes this meal special is a little friend i like to call msg the msg butter that i made in this in my opinion is the most applicable universal amazing thing in the world i could eat that alone all day cranberry sauce sugar orange juice and cranberries it's about 100 times better than that fruity sausage that slithers out of a can and plops onto your plate not to say that i'm pooping on anybody cause the cranberry sauce already did it for me but let's make it your damn self let's also introduce the turkey which also has the msg butter somehow the turkey tastes more like turkey second off not dry i'm gonna say this one last time a turkey should be perfectly juicy and flavorful and tender with or without the msg just cook it right okay i'm not gonna taste every single thing on this plate the stuffing is amazing the turkey is amazing potatoes everything is good oh i gotta eat this too obviously it's good otherwise i wouldn't be talking about it so you don't have to spend a thousand dollars or 500 or whatever on a thanksgiving meal for 10 to 15 people you can definitely do it for under 100 if that's not much cheaper then i don't know what the hell is brother the sun's about to go down so um i think it's time that we uh you want to know what else is full of a misleading story about pilgrims [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made thanksgiving dinner and it was beautiful it was a great thanksgiving dinner it wasn't like the basic choices of like the turkey and some salad and a little bitty mashed potatoes with a bland gravy we threw in some msg we got a little culinary you know like something like that i don't know what i'm saying but yes on an unrelated note i got my hair cut recently and everyone on instagram was saying that i look like lord farquaad if i look like lord farquaad let us know in the comments below but with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you

But it doesn't have to stop at pie. Maybe we take a step further with pecan pie ice cream?

Codyko's channel...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, you know there's one pie in this whole world that i consider to be one of the greatest inventions of all time this is it but we're not going to stop there i've got a little something special that we're going to do with it too let's go to our journey okay so today we were making one of my favorite pies of all time all through my childhood this was the pie tab i was always a picky eater when i was a kid even when it came to pie i never liked lemon pies i never liked chocolate pies obviously that's changed now but pecan pie is still at the forefront as my favorite pie ever now we're gonna do three things here i'm gonna show you how to make an incredible pie crust quite easily obviously the pecan pie and then third i'm going to show you what to do with the leftovers of pecan pie anyway with all that said let's make this shall we okay real quick i have to stop you we're in la right now we came to see a couple homies by the way we have been tested multiple times since this is a pie video i just want to let everybody know that i also did a pie video with kodiko which will be going up on his channel the link will be in the description on friday so keep your eyes peeled so we're going to begin making our masterpiece with well a pie crust i'm not a fan of crustless pie right they make papa angry anyway this is ultra easy and it needs only five ingredients start by mixing together two and a quarter cup or 337 grams of all-purpose flour with one and a quarter teaspoon or eight grams of fine sea salt and 1 tablespoon or 15 grams of granulated sugar give that some good old whiskey business and place that mixture in a food processor add in 1 cup or 225 grams of very cold unsalted butter which by the way has been cut into evenly sized cubes evenly sized butter means evenly sized aeration in the final product pulse that anywhere from four to eight times god dang it or until you get some evenly dispersed pea-sized balls in the flour and if you don't have a food processor don't worry a pastry blender or two forks work just fine then from there using a fork makes in half a cup or 120 milliliters of ice water obviously i strain out the ice i didn't get any cube particles in there now as soon as it forms a shaggy dough pour it out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for a few seconds and until you get a dough that holds itself together nicely like this don't over knead or the butter will melt and that's bad then wrap it in plastic wrap and rest it in the fridge for 15 to 20 minutes next dust a work surface lightly with flour dump out your dough and using a rolling pin roll your dough out nice and wide or until it's a little over a quarter of an inch thick looking like this it should be nice and wide and you'll likely need to dust it a few times while doing so once that's the correct size gently fold your dough in half then in half again to get this triangular piece center the point of your dough triangle into the center of a lightly greased 9x2 pie dish unfold and unfold again it's a neat little pie dough transfer trick i don't know it just works really well then press your pie dough into the pie mold filling out every little crevice letting the dough overhang do its thing because you know pi overhang is like life it's not worth focusing on the stuff that's not doing what you want it to instead focus on what you can and need to be focusing on in that moment in this case you're gonna press the dough into the mold evenly then you're going to address the overhang by trimming it all around the perimeter then finally using your fingers press and pinch a nice crimp along the entire edge to make a beautifully crimped pie dough see like life but more buttery from here you'll cover your pie with plastic wrap and rest it in the fridge while you make your pie filling you can also rest it overnight now in a medium sized bowl crack in three whole medium eggs whisk those eggs prematurely and then add a quarter cup or 75 grams of maple syrup one cup or 300 grams of light corn syrup three quarters of a teaspoon or two grams of fine sea salt three quarters of a cup or 190 grams of dark brown sugar 1 tablespoon or 13 grams of vanilla extract and finally whisk and stream in a quarter cup or 56 grams of melted unsalted butter that's melted not boiling hot just barely melted then just whisk all that together until thoroughly combined separately you're gonna rough chop two and a half cups or 287 grams of raw pecans they're gonna toast in the oven so raw is the best choice here and don't chop them too rough they should look like this it's a rough chop not a mince kisses from papa now grab your chilled pie crust evenly spread out your chopped pecans in the bottom of it then pour in all of your filling to fill that brother up then just gently pop that into the oven at 350 degrees fahrenheit or 175 degrees celsius for 40 to 50 minutes or until the pie is set and the top is lightly domed optionally halfway through its cook you can brush it with buttermilk for more golden edges and tent with foil if it starts to get too dark then just pull out your pie and let it cool completely to room temp i found that this is most enjoyable served either at room temp or completely chilled then all you gotta do is cut your pie i prefer to pop mine out of the pie dish for easier slicing slice the size of your choice plate it up add a nice fat quinel of whipped cream give it a light dusting of ground cinnamon for a little culinary flare and go on a pie journey that you shan't forget now we made our pie but what do we do with pie leftovers so the simple answer is well you can eat it but if you want to get a bit more creative use my mcflurry custard base place it in an ice cream maker that ideally works begin churning it and as soon as that ice cream gets to about 85 of the way done take a couple slices of your leftover pie remove the crust and place it to the side then finally chop up just the pie portion add that finely chopped pie to your churning ice cream base crush up the pie crust that you reserved then as soon as your ice cream is done churning place it in a piping bag and pipe it into a nice glass or bowl get it nice and tall sprinkle on your crushed pie crust and enjoy a beautiful cup of pecan pie soft serve yes this and this pecan pie in two forms i mean it's a classic an instant classic fireworks the christmas tree is up mom and dad are making out by the fireplace and it's really uncomfortable this is a pecan pie gosh darn it it's got all the classic flavors that you want yet elevated and it has that slight maple syrup flavor to it the crust is flaky and salty and buttery i don't know what else to tell you then this is a gosh darn perfect pot this is the real subject we're going to talk about pecan pie bourbon ice cream we got a little bit of the pie crust crumbled on top this is basically the mcflurry i mean i'm not going to take another bite because i need tg to come taste this big crimson's like what about me jesus christ that's a too big i immediately tasted the bourbon yep that's good wait don't take another bite now it's vicar's that's a funny spoon that did something we did something with that i could drink that we did something with something the funny thing is it's such a low effort way to deal with leftovers with this you just crush it up and put it in ice cream you don't understand okay we're not just putting pecan pie in ice cream we're elevating ice cream to a place that it has been before but if you haven't experienced it it's genuinely life changing this is the perfect pie a pecan two ways you wanna know what else is chewy sweet and full of nuts b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made our lovely pecan pie it had a gorgeous crust nice and flaky shiny crunchy crisp salty buttery rich and yet light at the same time and obviously the filling was nuts it's really not as sweet as you expect it to be yes it's sweet but there's a certain necessity to that that counterbalances the bitterness of the nut and the fattiness of it all it cuts through the richness and it also lifts it at the same time this is the perfect pie i've said it before i'll say it again and i hope that the ending was somewhat helpful to show you what you can do with leftover pie that's applicable to many other pies too give or take some ingredients but anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] you

I don't know why but we can definitely outdo them. We can make them completely homemade, better, and maybe save some time to make a specialty lobster roll...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, you know i don't know why people keep requesting this it's a biscuit big whoop but that doesn't mean that we can't make it so astronomically better than it's on a completely different existential plane [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today we are making the red lobster cheddar bay biscuits now i've done some research on them to me they look like cheddar biscuits with like potentially bay seasoning potentially chives and or other seasonings it's a very basic thing because of that we're not only going to just make these cheddar bay biscuits and make them better but we're also going to make arguably one of the greatest lobster sandwiches that's ever existed gonna be a little bit different but i'll just stop talking and let's make this shall we thank you for calling red lobster you're welcome [Music] there's so many layers if you would like to pay at the time of your phone i just want biscuits finally your estimated wait time is less than two minutes there's a wait time yeah it's uh joshua weissman they're like oh biscuits is it possible for me to just order a bunch of to-go biscuits okay bye love you she didn't say it back okay we're pulling up to red lobster oh we're stopping aggressively oh god oh god oh god i've never been so unexcited safety first this means lost the lady at the front was so nice and i very much enjoyed her so if she's watching this video i love you but it's the scariest to go area i've ever seen it literally looks like you're walking into a jail cell with a kiosk in it there was no one there there was just like this water overflowing in the back and the funny thing is i wasn't scared or nervous but i was sad so we've got the box why does it smell like pee here it is this is what it looks like it doesn't look bad although it's pretty soft it's more of like a bread oops gummy they're not bad they do taste good but for one i don't taste any cheese i don't taste any old bay whatsoever look they just taste like normal biscuits they've got like a little bit of cheese on top they're soft and they're salty i get why people like these they do taste good but they don't deserve the clout that they have at all so i think we should make something that is deserving of the clout making a biscuit is and should be a very uncomplicated thing to make so we'll be paying our respects and keeping this dough home style start by combining 2 cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour with 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of granulated sugar 2 teaspoons or 12 grams of fine sea salt 2 and a half teaspoons or 8 grams of baking powder half teaspoon or 4 grams of baking soda 1 tablespoon or 9 grams of garlic powder and 1 teaspoon or 4 grams of onion powder some people say that they have old bay in them but i actually didn't see those in the ingredients anywhere granted you can add a teaspoon if you want whisk all that together until thoroughly combined now separately cut up half a cup or 115 grams of very cold unsalted butter into half inch evenly sized cubes pour your flour mixture into a food processor add in your butter and pulse four to five times until you get pea-sized clumps of butter then add one cup or 80 grams of shredded sharp cheddar cheese pulse two to three more times to combine pour that mixture back into your bowl and mix it with about one cup or 240 milliliters of cold buttermilk try to avoid adding the buttermilk all at once you know feel the dough out you want to get to know this guy but most importantly you want it to hold its shape and not be too overly wet and sticky pour your dough out and knead until it comes all the way together dust that bad boy with flour and roll it into sort of a circular rectangular not really sure what shape this is and fold one side to the center and the other side over that push it lightly together then roll it out again lengthwise in the direction of the seams and repeat that letter folding process one last time then cover your dough with plastic wrap give it a personality and a respectful name and toss it in the fridge for about 30 minutes and up to overnight once you're ready to bake line a baking sheet with parchment paper then in a small bowl crack one egg and whisk together with a splash of buttermilk generously flour a work surface plop your dough down flour the top of it as well then roll it out into a circle that's about three quarters of an inch thick use a biscuit cutter cut out as many pieces as you can placing on your baking sheet as you go now look do not toss the scrap press it together and roll it out to continue punching out more dough until you ain't got no more scrap life brother make sure to line those all on your baking sheet with about one inch of separation then lightly brush the top of each of your biscuits with your buttermilk egg wash then place it in an oven set to 425 degrees fahrenheit or 220 celsius for 13 to 15 minutes or until golden brown like these lovelies they're glossy cheesy spiced up and ready to taste we have my refresh and then there yeah i mean visually this looks like a biscuit and this looks like someone had to come in on their day off and they had to make these but this is just how they look like little turds oh yeah let me tell you something flavor okay flavor immediately straight to the mouth you got the garlic you got the rich cheddar the butter real butter not fake butter and it's salty got a little bit of sweetness the outside is creepy and it's actually got some chew to it it's not just like soft it's flaky there's layers to it this is what a biscuit should be we'll let the taste testers decide it smells like peed isn't it it does smell like food there's a pea smell hot pee don't be shy you're being shy okay number two i'd go with number one this one just had more texture to it it had that shoe that you were talking about i enjoyed that a lot the takeaway is that if you're gonna be making this always eat it fresh obviously you could still win but if you let it rest and then you reheat it obviously the texture loses a little bit if we're comparing the fresh-made biscuits from what's this place called again red lobster but it's gonna be so astronomically better if it's fresh and obviously when you make my recipe you know i think we can take it even a step further lobster time okay so they taste amazing and it seems that we've already won for the most part but let's take it one step further and actually add lobster to this it is red lobster after all for four people you need about two to three live lobsters now hold on there do me a favor and go learn how to properly dispatch a lobster using a knife do not boil them alive all right it's inhumane it's not the right way to do it if you're gonna do it now if you don't feel comfortable with that then just go to the store and buy four lobster tails anyway toss your raw lobster pieces cloths tails and all into a pot of gently simmering water and let it simmer for about five minutes till red and just cook through then immediately plunge your lobster into an ice bath just till warm and manageable with bare hands you don't want it completely cold now work through all of your shells and do your best to pull out as much lobster as possible a little trick that i learned was to make a small crack at the end of a shell and then continuously tap the shell and often times the lobster will pop right out in one nice piece assuming you simmered it correctly now once you've got your lobster we're gonna make a simple bermante in a medium sauce pan add just enough water to cover the bottom of the pan like around a quarter cup place it over medium heat and as soon as it gets steamy hot but not boiling or simmering start whisking in half a cup or 115 grams of unsalted cold butter starting with just a single tablespoon keep constantly whisking that in reducing your heat to medium-low till that's nice and emulsified then start adding and whisking in more and more butter until all of it is added and you'll end up with a nice emulsified butter sauce remove that from the heat season the taste with salt and the juice of one small lemon mix in half a bunch of finely sliced chives then bring that up over medium heat just until very hot but not simmering or boiling chop up your lobster and add it and stir together with your bermante until everything is hot adjust any salt levels then get yourself a sliced cheddar bay biscuit top it with a fatty mound of lobster finish with some more fresh sliced chives top it with the other side of your biscuit and enjoy a potentially never seen before or tasted sandwich honey yes i wanna eat it i mean it's it's ridiculous this is the right kind of richness with a little bit of acidity from the lemon you've got the chives ultra ultra buttery and rich the sweet lobster honestly there's nothing wrong with this i'm sure that like lobster roll purists would be like gosh i can't believe you put lobster on a biscuit there's any biscuit that lobster belongs on it's this one right here just makes sense because i love him so much i'm gonna give him a little bit of butter thank you it's good for your health and since you just pooped you're gonna be ready to you're gonna be ready to poop after this all we've eaten today is torchy's tacos red lobster biscuits my biscuits and now this buttery lobster biscuit this is a formula for how you say diarrhea mwah so without further ado mystery crabs there you go there's some crunchy radish in there that's great it's so much better when it's like nice that lobster brings it home i'm gonna sleep after this this is really yummy and it's a winner and i'm sleepy and vikram's sleepy so now we go we're gonna go to bed and we're gonna cuddle okay bye you wanna know what else is full of butter cheese and hot steamy lobster b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made the red lobster cheddar bay biscuits and of course we went above and beyond we took some fresh lobster poached that bad boy tossed it in a chai bermonte place it on both sides of a biscuit and topped it with more butter and more chives and a little bit of salt and a little bit of lemon so good it's just righteous obviously that was inspired by a lobster roll it's really not all that different from a lobster roll i'm not sure how many people have thought of putting lobster on a biscuit but i'll be the first to tell you right now that there is absolutely nothing wrong with it and it is very tasty and i hope you get the chance to try it i do film quite a bit ahead of time now or almost a month right now maybe we have merch out by now but possibly not so if not i'm theoisowi but anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] you

I mean literally take bread, dip it in a simple custard recipe, and toast it in a pan. Doesn't get much easier...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, we've all heard the classic argument pancakes versus waffles but people we forgot about one important candidate french toast [Music] okay so today we're making french toast but not just any french toast we're not just gonna make one french toast like that no we're gonna do much more than that i feel like i broke my neck when i did that we're gonna make three different iterations we're gonna make a classic french toast a baked french toast and finally an ultra special french toast which i will describe later in the video now this is a beautiful example about how technique affects everything we have three recipes with nearly identical ingredients and yet completely different outcomes texturally flavor experience wise so let's do this right and make this shall we all right we got three toasts of the french variety to be making here but i'd like to post one specific and important point first that is what kind of bread are you going to use often times people might answer what they've got on hand but i'd venture to say that it's worth making a trip to pick up the optimal choice to me a nice brioche or holla proves to be the best choice for any french toast due to its superior flavor and ability to absorb moisture but you guys never listen to me so whatever you can also get creative and use something like a bunch of croissants or you can use literally any other bread like sourdough or loaf pan white bread you get the point anyway let's talk a classic french toast first very easy and fast in a medium sized bowl add three whole eggs and two egg yolks along with one teaspoon or three grams of ground cinnamon half a teaspoon or three grams of fine sea salt one and a half tablespoons or 23 grams of light brown sugar and a little pinch of fresh grated nutmeg whisk all that together until thoroughly combined then whisk in half a cup or 120 milliliters of heavy cream and three quarters of a cup or 180 milliliters of whole milk that's your custard now separately pick out your bread holler or brioche is good for this particular recipe and of course much better if you slice it yourself so that each slice is about three quarters of an inch thick once you've got eight to ten slices dunk your slices in the custard and let them sit for a few seconds to soak up the liquid separately in a large pan heat it over medium heat grease that up with some unsalted butter then once that's hot and bubbling lay in two slices of your soaked bread let that cook in toast for about three minutes or until you get a nice brown crust you can also add additional butter at this point if you wish then flip and repeat on the other side from there just transfer your finished pieces to a plate and repeat with the rest and obviously to serve this is pretty straightforward you add a nice pad of butter on top hit it with some maple syrup and you're ready to roll now let us taste test before moving on this is the ultra easy super traditional you know take the bread yep and you put it in the pan and then that's it very simple this is typically done with the old bread hence the classic name i believe it's pronounced which sounds like pample mu you know that you made a proper custard that soaked properly when it makes this noise you understand okay it's nice and soft you hardly put any weight at all and the knife goes right through custardy this is a classic this tastes like a complete classic but with the brioche or or holla you want to do holla it's just perfect it's got the crunch on the outside it's got the custardy smooth melt in your mouth inside it's sweet it's got a little bit of saltiness it's fragrant it's spiced this is my ideal classic french toast we're gonna go make the other one now next up we have a very special baked croissant french toast the custard for this is very similar in a bowl add five whole eggs one teaspoon or six grams of fine sea salt two teaspoons or six grams of ground cinnamon a quarter cup or 62 grams of brown sugar a pinch of fresh grated nutmeg 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of vanilla extract whisk it together until thoroughly combined and finally whisk in 2 cups or 480 milliliters of whole milk now separately in a small saucepan you're gonna add half a cup or 115 grams of unsalted butter melt that over medium heat until completely melted then add 1 cup or 218 grams of packed brown sugar whisk all that together continue heating until it begins to simmer and some of the sugar has dissolved and you get a homogeneous paste spread that on the bottom of a greased 9x12 baking dish then snag yourself about eight to ten good croissants or bake them yourself using my guide of course slice them all in half i mean look at that structure by the way shout out to magnul bakery in houston for these croissants they were incredible and it's one of the first times that i've actually bought croissants out in a while and it's just very amazed by the work they're doing there layer in and arrange your croissants into a baking dish make them look nice when layered by the way they'll just like throw them all in there and they look sloppy all right papa's gonna be matte pour all of your custard over your croissants and cover that with foil and let it sit for about 25 to 30 minutes to soak or you can let it sit overnight in the fridge once you're ready to bake pop it into an oven set to 350 degrees fahrenheit or 175 celsius with the foil on for 30 minutes then uncover your dish and bake an additional 15 minutes or until the tops are crisp and the custard is cooked then pull it out of the oven let it cool slightly for 10 minutes and dust the tops with powdered sugar it's a beautiful sight like snowing on beautiful mountainous peaks of buttery quiffy deliciousness now hit that with some fresh fruit of choice cut out some nice even squares and plate it up with an optional drizzle of maple syrup now i think you know how this taste test is probably going to go okay so this beautiful little concoction is essentially a french toast casserole but my friends with a beautiful lovely butter so one thing i would note about this french toast croissant casserole is the croissant is listen you understand whippy at the top nice and flaky still the bottom has some fat caramel so we got caramel syrup we might i did something because wow this is uh this might be one of the best french toast things i've ever made in my life this is like the filet mignon of french toast it melts in your mouth it's silky smooth on the inside but you can still detect those sort of like flaky layers of the croissant but each layer is custardy smooth perfection i don't know man i don't know that i could ever have french toast any other way without knowing that this exists long story short this will change your life hmm it's like melting but i can also bite it doesn't this heavenly bite now we could have stuck with two french toasts but no no no we need to add one last special one nutella stuffed churro style french toast it's a mouthful in both senses of the term mouthful first thing make a simple cinnamon sugar by whisking together three quarters of a cup or 175 grams of granulated sugar with two teaspoons or six grams of ground cinnamon till thoroughly combined uh don't inhale that though not a good idea so you're gonna use the same exact custard as the regular french toast at the beginning but this time you're specifically going to use brioche bread and you're gonna cut that bread into one and a half inch thick slices yes the thickest slice of bread you ever did see then using a knife cut a two inch slit at the bottom making sure to drive your knife about 70 of the way into the bread wiggling it around to create a little pocket on the inside then slip a piping bag full of nutella or any filling of choice really you could use anything even a lemon curd fill it up with nutella but not too much you don't want it to be like bloated and ready to pop just enough to fill it then just like before soak your bread in the custard pop it in a hot pan that has enough butter to coat the bottom and let it toast for three minutes flip and repeat on the other side now once your bread is toasted immediately toss it in your cinnamon sugar while it's still hot so that the sugar sticks coat every single side and edge then just put that huge caloric rich decadent feller on a plate optionally top it with some whipped cream and a healthy drizzle of maple syrup should you desire that oh and don't forget to take a look on the inside i mean you gotta make sure that that thang is thanging now let us commence on one final taste test that's a why does it look like that i like nutella stuffed things you know a donut for example a donut stuffed with nutella's great this almost is reminiscent of that it's it almost has a fried feeling to it especially with it being dusted in cinnamon sugar it's like a churro it's stuffed with nutella feels so right we just keep going up we don't stop we take it a step above everybody else almost said that's about better because this feels like about better feels like better french toast this this takes almost no extra time this is such a hearty bite of french toast it's it's still it's still got structure to it but again you have that classic soft custardy inside you bite through it there's crunch on the crust from the sugar and then the inside oozes with sweet chocolatey and nutella you go to the best brunch place in town for something like this but you saw how simple it was you know you want this and you know that you need it you want to know what else is square moist and steamy hot b-roll [Music] we're guys and that is it so we made french toast three different ways that were arguably great in their own way i don't know that i would say one is better than the other although experientially i did enjoy probably the croissant or the stuffed one the most but you know maybe you don't always want something that intense and that rich in that much so then you would offer the classic in that case i hope this is a good lesson for you not just in the world of french toast but like i said before in the world of technique and how important that affects stuff it is this heart and soul of everything if you don't have technique you have truly nothing or well maybe you know the point is it's important but anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time this is why are you covering your face [Music] are you serious right now why is everyone farting in here right now i'm trying to eat this french toast i can't focus on this because they're too focused on the fart back there who farted now both of you deeply inhale [Music] now [Music] you

It’s really easy, you just need some finesse and a little xanthan gum. 

Recipe:...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, okay look i gotta be honest with you didn't really want to do this it was requested by many many people and i just can't let the people down so if we're gonna take this on we're gonna do our very very best [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so we're doing starbucks drinks but better now before anyone asks about the pumpkin spice latte because it's just a reoccurring thing every year i don't know how people are not tired of it yet all i have to say is this it's not always about the pumpkin spice latte i really want to focus on the frappuccino here because this is something that for some reason a lot of people have a lot of difficulty making it separates it melts instantly there's a secret to it some people know some people don't most people don't and then of course we're gonna go through a couple other things like how to make nitro cold brew and then the stupid pink drink which i'm still against it and i'm staying against it but i'll make it for you anyway because papa love you with all that said let's make this shall we i'm not a huge fan of starbucks but where else can you just whip into a drive-through and go and get coffee right then and there we've been in line for 10 minutes and now we can't get out because we're locked in oh wow thank you okay so we've got the well we're not gonna drop this one i hate that noise this is worse than like pulling nails out of my feet we've got two fraps this disgusting thing and nitro cold brew now all these are awful it's been probably like six to eight years since i've had a frappuccino we got the caramel one first i'll be sure to mix it let's probably melt it a little yeah there's no coffee in this at all it's just like so sweet you hardly even taste the caramel for the record it tastes like good but like sickeningly sweet like starting my morning like this i can't imagine the mocha this one's a little more tolerable in the sweetness so these are both really milkshakes if anything don't taste bad but i mean like coffee no this has over 50 grams of sugar in it holy sugar the only reason i'm doing this drink or really any of this at all is because you guys have asked for it i hate this it's not that bad but it's just like tea with like milk or like coconut milk or something natural cold brew now this is pretty straightforward there's nothing else added to this i mean the nitro is there but the flavor is awful so we can do much better than this right so with any coffee we need to briefly discuss the fact that you can already be about 85 of the way to beating starbucks by choosing the right beans obviously you could go with a local small batch producer or you could go as far as i did and roast your own yes i'm gonna do it i'm gonna be using this jean cafe roaster but there are also 30 stovetop roasters that you can get on amazon too link in the description for all day now for this guy i loaded it up with eight ounces of green coffee beans these are nicaraguan and ethically sourced set the roasting tip to 455 fahrenheit or 235 celsius turn that bad boy on and let it roast for about 15 to 18 minutes i actually typically prefer to go by color i want a medium roast so i set it to cool down mode just slightly before it reached medium because the carryover heat is going to force it to coast just to the color that i want then bada bing bada boom i'm crazy because i bought a coffee roaster just to flex on starbucks oh p.s it's better to let these beans rest for about three to five days before using them anyway so once you've got good beans let's talk salted caramel frappuccino unfortunately for me now to make the caramel combine one cup or 125 grams of granulated sugar and a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of water mix that together turn the heat to medium high and bring that to a boil now just let that guide cook for about 8 to 12 minutes or until it turns a deep amber color like this be careful not to let it burn because it will happen quickly now immediately whisk in 5 tablespoons or 70 grams of butter 1 teaspoon or 4 grams of kosher salt the beans from one vanilla bean pod keep continuously whisking until everything is combined and emulsified that means no hot butter lying on top right papa will be very sad now turn off the heat stream and whisk in half a cup or 120 milliliters of heavy whipping cream until thoroughly combined oh and uh don't forget to splash tj with searing hot caramel on accident yeah that really helps lift the flavor then just pour this guy into a heat-proof container to cool it'll be pretty loose for now but as it cools it will reach the perfect viscosity who doesn't like that word right it's just like a nasty word viscosity next we're gonna make ourselves a very simple simple syrup by combining equal parts of water and sugar that's one cup and one cup place it over medium heat whisking continuously just until dissolved then let it cool completely okay so when it comes to blending a frappuccino it usually clumps up and you get this sort of like yucky poopy mess thanks to you guys i got a bunch of great dms from people who've worked at starbucks suggesting that it needs an emulsifier to avoid that simply put you're gonna need xanthan gum link in the description for that as well but most grocery stores also carry it if you're gonna make a lot of fraps then go ahead and place your simple syrup in a blender start blending and stream in exactly six grams of xanthan gum you'll get sort of a suggestive looking jelly otherwise you can add a tiny sprinkle of xanthan while blending to achieve the same results one last thing they usually use cold brew which obviously you can make yourself with little to no equipment but i actually opted for espresso for more depth of flavor and you can use an espresso machine like mine or you could use something cheaper like a mocha pot now we're ready to blend this little feller in a blender add two cups or 280 grams of ice half a cup or 120 milliliters of good espresso or cold brew concentrate three quarters of a cup 180 milliliters of whole milk or any non-dairy milk if you're one of those uh people that gets all farty from milk it's okay i think i do too it's fine three tablespoons of your caramel sauce and a quarter cup of your xanthan simple paste stuff then just let that blender rip and blend until nice and smooth again if you don't want to make the xanthan simple you could just add about a half teaspoon of purexanthin while blending then just get yourself a glass coat the walls with caramel try to make yourself a nice little pattern then pour in your frap leave about an inch of headspace then top it with a nice whipped cream and finish off the top of that whipped cream with a nice classy drizzle of your salty vanilla bean caramel it's already looking and sounding a lot better than its starbucks counterpart but let's see how the taste test goes okay so we have the starbucks stupid piece of i mean frappuccino oh yes try this one holy flavor we've got one that actually tastes like coffee it's not overly sweet if you were to taste these back-to-back you would understand what i'm trying to get at it actually has that rich salted caramel it's got deep coffee espresso flavor this is delicious and i do think that we've won but of course we need a taste tester and i need to get new straws a little backstory vikram does not like coffee here it is and here's the second one all right i will say the second one is a lot better the winner is really yeah no so we needed a coffee drinker in here to really have the side-by-side of a coffee drinker versus a non-coffee drinker this one number dose i'm gonna guess that yours was the first one because it was way better when we do butt betters it's always like you've got the in and outs and you've got the burger kings and like we use techniques to make them better i don't want to recreate this my idea of making this better would be making something that is not this but actually coffee because that is the whole point and to be fair i used to work at starbucks these are made with five percent coffee oh next up is something that i was forced to do by you guys which is the pink drink and is also sickeningly simple get yourself one cup for 240 milliliters of hot water dunk in a hibiscus tea bag and an acai tea bag before anybody complains i tried using pure sci powder and whole hibiscus and it was way too dark to achieve the proper color secondarily i was not a fan of this whole process and i will never be doing this again okay papa just do this for you once anyway once that's steeped for about three to five minutes remove the bags and add half a cup or 120 milliliters of white grape juice yes it's listed on the ingredients for the pink drink and add a little bit of honey to taste now finally pour that over ice top with a generous splash of coconut milk stir together and garnish with fresh strawberries now hopefully this tastes better than it looks so let's give that a little whirl i didn't even want to do the pink drink for the record i'm not trying to have a bad attitude i just think this drink is silly it doesn't taste bad though also this is like kind of separated and gross it either looks like dish detergent or it looks like fluids that are pink before we get demonetized let's taste this oh i still don't like it i get it it's like a fruity slightly creamy it's gotta drink this i don't really know what this is supposed to be that's the problem i can't recreate something that's not real i'll just let starbucks have this one because i just hate this so much the winner of the pink drink starbucks you can have this one please take the trophy because i don't want now to recover from the sadness of the pink drink i figured we'd do one last little thing which is a little trick to make homemade nitro cold brew simply get 250 milliliters of your favorite cold brew optionally mix in about 12 milliliters of maple syrup pour it into an isi canister link in the description pop on the lid twist on a fresh whippet let that sit and aerate for about three minutes now put on some smooth jazz get yourself a nice beer glass and slowly extract what is now your very first homemade ultra fizzy nitro cold brew and as it turns out it is even better than it looks okay so we've got nitric oil and nitrogen cold brew at the end of the day well let me sip it first oh yeah i mean look at that i mean this is still actually shockingly carbonated i didn't know that the whippet method works so well it's ultra smooth it's a little sweet it's like a lightly carbonated beer but instead of getting all silly you get energy nitro cold brew is only as good as the cold brew that's put in it i can drink starbucks's cold brew it's just extraordinarily flat and bitter in comparison to this which is smooth rich sweet but anyway we win this one for sure vikram brought up a good point actually he's gonna know which one he's sipping on which is why we create an illusion number put it in your mouth hole you just sip it just like a like a beer number two it's so quiet i mean they both taste good the first one was really sweet i'm gonna go with the second one because i like cold brews that don't have sugar i added sugar trying to fool him wait did i pick starbucks yeah you pick strawberry i added the sugar because i thought he would like sorry all right this  episode is over you want to know what else is an emotional roller coaster for josh to do because you ask him to do it b-roll all right guys and that is it so all right a little bit of a weird but better this time frappuccino i would say we won if you're a coffee drinker if you're not a coffee drinker then you're probably gonna prefer starbucks obviously because i wanted to taste like coffee the pink drink i just to me mine tasted good but didn't taste anything like theirs at all so we'll give it to starbucks i hate that drink last one is the nitro cold brew now because i thought well tj's probably gonna want it to be a little bit sweeter so i added a little bit of maple syrup papa kind of spanked himself there at the end of the day the nitro cold brew that you make is only as good as the cold brew that you have so the better the cold brew the better the nitro cold brew i'll just stick to my morning lattes how about that all right we will do much better on the next one i can assure you that with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time you

endless amount of sugar perfect for any nine-year-old obviously a toaster shooter comes from a traditional food it's frugal to me toaster strudels are a little more reminiscent to that of a danish almost but the crust isn't quite there and when you really analyze what toaster strudels actually are they're not that great so with all that said let's make this better shall we we are going to the coveted one and only wow i'm so excited to be here not really let's just get in and get out make it quick you walk in and the first thing i see is somebody with a mask that says senpai and then he tries to steal something and then a dog goes running across we just got here it's been five seconds toasty scrutiny oh we walked faster there he is a little fat man little fat man all right i guess we're gonna buy it i already hate it thank you okay so we've got the box oh this the guy you've been looking for so you put it in the toaster right that's what that's why it's called sister shooter we're gonna do our patented design here i'm running out okay so we have this i don't want to eat this and look the icing like just goes everywhere it doesn't even hold its shape who did this so here's the inside yikes buddy why is it so red i can't i don't know how i ate this because when i was a kid i hated cough syrup and that's like bringing back bad memories if we can't do better than this i don't know what i'm going to do with my life all right folks so you're going to need puff pastry to get this recipe rolling no pun intended now like i usually say making your own is always going to be better and i do have a guide which will be in the link in the description but if you go the store bought route i would recommend due for pastry let's first discuss fillings first thing will be one of my favorites strawberry serve with 2 pounds or 900 grams of strawberries obviously cut the tops off of each strawberry then cut all of them in half or quarters depending on how large they are you know sometimes you just get one of those gigantic baseball strawberries yeah you won't want to quarter that place all of your cut strawberries in a medium-sized sauce pot then to that you're going to add three cups or 550 grams of granulated sugar i know it's a lot just trust me mix all that together and let that sit for 10 minutes this is called maceration that's maceration for the nasty folks in the back we do that because it helps release juice and activates the natural pectin in the fruit now using a handheld masher mash up your strawberries as much as you can then add a quarter cup or 65 grams of lemon juice place it on a stove set that over medium heat and let that heat stirring occasionally until the sugar melts and much of the liquid has been released from the strawberries it's gonna be really soupy and that's what you want now increase the heat to medium-high bring it to a boil and let that little man boil for about 10 minutes or until it reaches 220 degrees fahrenheit or 104 degrees celsius it needs to be thick make sure to test the thickness and then you have jam then just let it cool completely at room temp or do what i did and chill it in a bowl set over an ice bath now for another more seasonal option let's talk apple filling start by peeling two honey crisp apples grate them on a box grater then separately in a large pan heat two and a half tablespoons or 35 grams of unsalted butter over medium heat let that melt and cook swirling the pan occasionally until you get a light brown butter then immediately add in your apples stir to coat with the butter then once those juices seep out and begin to simmer stir in two tablespoons or 30 milliliters of rum or whiskey let that simmer for an additional two minutes to cook off the alcohol then add one and a half tablespoons or 12 grams of all-purpose flour half a cup 100 grams of light brown sugar 1.5 teaspoons or 5 grams of ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon or 12 grams of lemon juice and a nice generous pinch of salt stir that together bring to a simmer and let that cook just until the apple is cooked through and thickened about three to five minutes okay so now we have all of our fillings as for puff pastry you'll need a full recipe of mine cut it in two pieces or 14 ounces or 400 grams of store bought now roll one of your sheets into a quarter inch thick rectangle that's about 10 inches wide and 12 inches long now from the bottom of your rectangle mark a small slit at three inch intervals across the entire dough from there just cut your dough into long strips using those markers as your guide you can also use a small box to keep your cuts nice and straight or just go by eye but you know we like it to look perfect once you have those strips fold them in half to make a light crease in the center then cut across that center so you have two evenly sized pieces repeat that with all of your dough now separately make yourself some egg wash by whisking together one egg in a small splash of water take two halves of your dough place a nice doll for your filling of choice in the center leaving a half inch border around the edges now look be very careful not to overfill these guys for one papa will be mad and for two if you do it'll keep the dough from sticking together and that's a no good now from there you're gonna give it a light brushing of egg wash around that blank border that you left take another half of dough gently lay it on top of the other and pinch the edges shut being careful not to shoot any jam out of the sides make sure those edges are completely sealed repeat with the rest of your little shrooty duties stupid stupid joke now the first couple are difficult to do but you'll get the hang of how much jam to put pretty quickly after doing a couple of these place all of your finished pastries on a couple of baking sheets and into the fridge to chill for 15 minutes then preheat your oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit or 205 degrees celsius once the oven is hot and your chili boys are ready place those guys on parchment-lined baking sheets brush the tops of each pastry with your egg wash from earlier and place in the oven for about 20 minutes or until a beautiful golden brown and cook through now while those are baking let's make our icing start off with two ounces or 55 grams of cream cheese in a medium sized bowl beat that together with electric beaters till light and fluffy then beat in an optional couple drops of almond extract or just spill it everywhere that works too [ __ ] beat in 1 cup 125 grams of powdered sugar until thoroughly incorporated then add in whole milk 1 teaspoon at a time until it reaches the desired drizzling consistency just please don't make it too thin now finally beat in the beans from one vanilla bean or two teaspoons or six grams of vanilla extract okay so once you've pulled out your lovely strudels let them cool in a wire rack just until they're warm then immediately drizzle them with a nice pattern like you see here i mean look this is the classic drizzle of course but you can do some other fancy drizzling pattern if you want i don't know we want a little nostalgia either way once these guys have been drizzled upon sounds weird you'll have a lovely bunch of homemade toaster strudels that we must know the taste to decide upon a winner but before we do that let's just take a look at the inside of this i mean look at that it's flaky it's airy look at all those lovely buttery layers jam i mean come on we we won but on to the taste test i mean visually these already look great you've got the layers two flavors we'll go with the strawberry because that's the closest to whatever that stuff is this isn't even really a fair competition it's almost like a croissant it's super airy crispy on the outside it's buttery it's rich it's got the sweet glaze that actually tastes like something other than just sugar the jam itself actually tastes like strawberries which it should as you know we should always have a taste tester so uh tj's chin today wait i want to eat this apple one for a stay over there if you're not a strawberry jam person the apple one is for you okay so tip is the other way no other way yep all right there we go so today there you go gooey goopy that was a bite hell of a bite right there why don't you chew that did you just swallow yeah should probably try chewing huh i tasted it though here's number two so we got one and two it tastes like number two [Laughter] that's not good i think it's too obvious it's sometimes we just go i think we go so above and the texture's so contrasty and different it's hard to do the whole blind taste test because it's it's so obvious this a poopy long story short we win yet again but better toasters thank you so much for coming papa love you you want to know what else is puffy and full of jam yup that sounded worse than anticipated [Music] b-roll [Music] so all right guys that is it so we made toaster strudel honestly was not that hard it's pretty straight forward you make some amazing jam always make it from scratch don't use the store-bought stuff you make it from scratch it feels better emotionally tastes better physically but most importantly you get the satisfaction of making something beautiful with your own two hands even if you don't make your own puff pastry it doesn't matter the point is that you at least still crafted it yourself but also i might judge you just a little bit if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music]

Is Chicago style deep dish pizza actually pizza? I don't think so... it's more of a casserole but regardless...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, if you saw the title and thumbnail of this video you know why you're here so uh let's not waste any time okay so the origins of chicago deep dish pizza is about as hazy as the answer to the question is deep dish pizza actually even pizza and oh yes i am gonna go there because well i'm really sure that it is now there's strong evidence the deep dish pizza was originally conceived a pizzeria uno in chicago either by its founder or its chef who knows so deep dish pizza isn't just about being deep and thick it's it's got a lot of other things to it it's it's more of like a casserole to me than pizza it's just not pizza i'm sorry but i would argue that it is very satisfying but there's one more thing that i think will keep you as satisfied as this pizza bundling your home and car insurance and that's where today's sponsor geico comes in just how deep dish combines what you love about pizza and a great hot dish geico allows you to combine their offerings with something that you love even more not only that but you could even save some money in the process for bundling made easy visit geigo.com today and click the links in the description to learn more now with all that said let's do this shall we so with all of our breads we're going to get our dough going first mix together 3 cups or 430 grams of all-purpose flour half a cup or 82 grams of cornmeal 2 teaspoons or 12 grams of fine sea salt and 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of granulated sugar mix that together till combined separately dissolve two and a half teaspoons or eight grams of instant yeast in one and a third cup or 300 milliliters of water around 95 degrees fahrenheit or 35 degrees celsius start mixing in a stand mixer on medium-low speed you can also do this by hand add in your yeasty water and a quarter cup of 56 grams of unsalted butter that has been gently melted but isn't flaming hot just barely melted mix all that together until it forms a dough then continue to knead for about five minutes or until nice and smooth place in a greased bowl and let that rise around one hour or until doubled in size now once you got the fatty sorry punch the life out of your dough dump it out on a lightly floured work surface and roll it out into a rough rectangle around 14 inches long slap on three and a half tablespoons or 50 grams of unsalted softened butter and spread evenly across the entire dough then tightly roll your dough up like you see here cut it in half and form those two butter snakes into balls place your balls in a lightly greased bowl side by side cover with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge for one hour they can't have pizza without sauce and in chicago they apparently like their sauce on the thickem wickham side anyway cut four slices of bacon into half inch wide lardons place those in a pot over medium heat and let that cook until nice and quickly remove from the pot and chop till very very fine in that same pot add a quarter cup or 56 grams of olive oil or unsalted butter heat over medium heat till nice and hot add in one onion finely minced or grated yes you can grate an onion it's just a bit of a experience five cloves of minced garlic and two teaspoons or seven grams of red pepper flakes cook and stir until your onions have cooked down and released most of their moisture add a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes season lightly with salt along with a small pinch of sugar to curb the acidity add your finely chopped bacon back and you could totally add some chopped oregano if you want bring that up to a simmer over a medium heat and reduce to low and let that cook down for about 15 minutes or until nice and thick adjust the salt levels to your liking and let it cool most of the way before using see i wasn't joking about a thicko mode sauce now i'm sure there's some chicago in watching this right now that considers this to be soup but you know i'm happy with it now you can use an actual deep dish pan but i feel like more people probably have a 10 inch cast iron skillet lying around somewhere so lightly grease that bad boy take out one of your dough boys roll it out until about 12 inches wide drape it in your pan pressing against the walls to form it like you see here then separately in a bowl mixed together one cup of grated compt compt compte the french cheese and half a cup of grated parmigiano-reggiano now this is where things mess with my head a little bit don't ask me why they do this ask the people of chicago so first uh lay down about half a pound of mozzarella either shredded or sliced followed by half of your comte mixture compt top with any meats of your choice you could do salami pepperoni cooked sausage you know the list goes on and on here i have a mix of pepperoni and genoa salami finally hit it with half of your sauce and spread evenly over your well it's more like a casserole or a pie than a pizza but yeah hit it with a light grating of parmigiano-reggiano and pop it in an oven set to 425 fahrenheit or 220 degrees celsius for 18 to 25 minutes or until the crust is a beautiful deep golden brown feel free to tent with foil if it's getting too dark now pull out your lovely little man and let it cool for about eight minutes then hit it with some additional fresh grated parmigiano a nice glug of extra virgin olive oil and let's taste this utterly delicious albeit strange chicago tradition okay so we have our this is a casserole let's be honest i'm supposed to be on a diet i am on a diet as a matter of fact and yet here i am you can see the crumbs nice and spongy you can see the crumble is nice and spongy you've got some nice aeration [Music] my first impression on chicago deep dish pizza was um negative to say the least my thoughts were like what is the point of this it annoys me because it's an inverted pizza you put the sauce on top like why chicago but you know what after eating it tasting it experiencing it like this making it myself it's been a while since i've had it and this really takes me back this is a wonderful bite of pizza if you're from chicago and you think we did a good job let me know if you're not from chicago you should make this because it's very worth it and you can do this look i'll be honest with you it's not one of my favorites but this is very good and yummy and it's a new experience for pizza okay gosh darn it all right i'm gonna stop spitting on this bye you wanna know what else is deep plump and full of melty stuff b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it thank you again to our friends at geico for sponsoring today's episode they're helping me with my culinary journey around the united states and they want to help you too by helping you save money on your home and car insurance so head down to the link below and visit geigo.com today now let's talk about this pizza for a second now that we've eaten it we've made it look it's still technically pizza it's borderline not pizza here's my shtick all right it's good it's delicious it's an enjoyable thing to eat i really don't like when people make blanket statements about food and cooking because the reality is a true master of food and cooking would understand that there's a million billion ways to do something and that there's never really one right way to do anything in life but i think it just goes too beyond what i perceive pizza to be i don't like the fact that the sauce is on top i just don't i personally think it's a better eating experience the other way around it's my own personal preference and it's how i would rather serve people who are eating my food nonetheless it is still completely delicious and satisfying if you've never had it before or you've never made it i would highly recommend it and this is a great place to start with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you
235,235,$50 Steakhouse Dinner Vs. $250 Steakhouse Dinner | But Cheaper,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/crUTaTP4dBM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLCXYwypDTMFVthPpdJ0NQRS5NDZOA,crUTaTP4dBM,"10 minutes, 53 seconds","Going to a steak house is great but it's also gonna cost you a pretty penny. I say we can do this full steak meal completely homemade, on a tight budget with results that are... dare I say...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, let me paint a little picture for you you go to a steakhouse you're with another person maybe your wife your lover your bff you order a couple steaks and a couple vegetable sides the bill comes back and it's 250 for that no but what if i told you we could do it for this price right here that is but cheaper [Music] one quick note before we start i have to tell you i was featured on harper bazaar's food diaries where like lil yachty went on there and he was like here's everything i eat in a day or binging with babish went on there he's like here is everything i eat in a day i'm on there i was featured and there will be a link in the description to watch it so if you're ever wondering what papa eats in a day aside from all the other crazy stuff like a regular day today click the link in the description and enjoy anyway onward with the video i want to make sure that i have what i'm saying backed up with a factuality with facts so let's go to a steakhouse and uh figure this out we're on the way to uh on a steakhouse well we'll order two steaks and a couple sides i'm expecting it to be over the 200 marker at the end of the day a reasonable meal you know sometimes we want to go out and splurge and that's totally fine steakhouse is totally fine i'm just presenting the idea of is it worth this price okay we're done we ate it was actually not bad the food was actually pretty good we got two steaks we got three sides i wanted to get normal asparagus they brought out fried asparagus whatever it is what it is the total price was 222 and then plus tip obviously you got to give it at least a decent tip so fifty dollar tip so the total comes out to 272.45 okay signed truly yours oh king i understand a restaurant's always gonna be more expensive but like you got three vegetable sides and two steaks for almost three hundred dollars i think we could do better than that okay so we're back you see what i mean right like you guys understand where i'm coming from with this you've got like steamed asparagus hollandaise very basic stuff a steak cooked with a little bit of butter and and that's it the astronomical price is i don't know why people still think that this is worth it look the restaurants that i've worked at the restaurants that i've been to for that same dollar amount you could have a completely different more intense more culinary experience probably for a little less so with all that said let's do this shall we okay so we're gonna do our best to keep the price as low as possible without skipping on too many of the classic ingredients but given what we're competing with i don't think that'll be too hard first things first we need to get our mashed potatoes mashed get three pounds of yukon gold potatoes peel the skins off of each and every lovely little feller cut those potatoes into nice two inch chunks toss them in a pot of water season that generously with salt and bring to a boil now those guys are going to cook for about 10 to 15 minutes or until easily pierced with a fork but not mush now while that's cooking add three quarters of a cup or 170 grams of salted butter to a small sauce pot i use salted just because it makes it easier to season them properly but you can use insulted too it's a correctional thing i'm trying to work some magic i don't know along with half a cup or 120 milliliters of whole milk place it on the stove over medium heat until hot and the butter is melted now drain your potatoes and in the same pot add the cooked potatoes back then begin mashing them with a handheld masher season to taste with salt then add your butter and milk mixture then just keep mashing until everything is as smooth as you can get it finally add half a cup or 125 grams of sour cream stir together until well incorporated and finish with half a bunch of very thinly sliced fresh chives season again with salt and pepper to taste and remember to season your potatoes nicely okay you're gonna need more than you think no more under seasoned mashed potatoes please it makes a big difference now next up is an old classic asparagus with hollandaise for the asparagus cut off the woody bottoms first then using a peeler peel the lower two thirds of each asparagus spear you don't need to peel all the way down to the core just the first little outer layer of skin i prefer to do this because it makes the bottom a little more tender and they tend to soak up a little more juice and seasoning this way now place this in a roasting tray drizzle with a little bit of olive oil to coat season a taste with salt add in any fresh herbs of choice i used fresh thyme oh and uh don't forget some fresh cracked black pepper too if you're feeling a little bit crazy today buddy sorry stupid joke then toss into an oven set to 400 degrees fahrenheit or 204 degrees celsius for 15 to 18 minutes or until cook through but with a little bit of that nice snap left right so on the hollandaise thing a lot of people struggle with this but i have a simple trick to make it much easier first add half a cup or 170 grams of salted not unsalted butter to a small pan we use salted just because sometimes seasoning hollandaise it doesn't dissolve and this way the salt is already dissolved now you're gonna heat that over low heat until very gently melted we don't want this super hot just warm and melted separately in a blender add three large egg yolks and half of a large lemon worth of lemon juice blend the yolk and the juice together on medium speed until it turns a pale yellow color then while continuously blending slowly stream in your butter now take it easy on this one alright don't just dump it all in if you go nice and slow then once all the butter is added you'll have a lovely hollandaise awaiting you below feel free to season it with a little pinch of cayenne potentially extra salt but you shouldn't need it then pour it into a small thermos close it and keep it warm make sure to always keep your holidays warm and use it within an hour of making it now we all know the classic steakhouse vegetables here we've got two carrots one zucchini and one yellow squash which to be honest at this point it's basically just yellow zucchini texture-wise i don't know it's a unpopular opinion but just cut those bad boys into strips by first cutting them into half-inch thick planks then cutting those planks into half inch thick bars now if your vegetables are too long obviously i cut mine in half here to make them a little shorter but that's up to you repeat that with all your vegetables and look at that now before you cook those let's first get our steaks put together you can choose whichever budget stick cut you want which you can see in my steak but cheaper guide there'll be a link in the description for that but i used these two thick new york strip steaks which totaled out to about 15 per steak because they were on sale i prefer to let my steak sit at room temp for 20 minutes prior to searing i know that's been debunked but i can't help myself either way make sure to pack your steaks completely dry with a paper towel you don't want any moisture left on them then get yourself a nice large skillet place it on the stove add enough oil just to coat the bottom place it over medium-high heat and once that's ripping hot in the oil is about to start smoking generously season your steaks with salt and pepper on both sides then add your steaks immediately to the pan and sear for about three minutes or until you get a nice gorgeous deep brown crust by the way make sure your steaks are at least one to one and a half inches thick otherwise they'll overcook during this part now flip each of those then sear for one more minute then add a couple crushed garlic cloves left whole and a fresh herb of choice this one is rosemary along with a quarter cup or 56 grams of unsalted butter then just baste your steaks repeatedly with that butter don't stop you know get a nice nice flow you want a little bit of foaminess when you're basting until it reaches your desired cook level i cook one of these medium rare and one medium which i don't consider to be proper but certain people like it not judging you i'm just i prefer medium rare i'm just i don't know now pull those steaks out and let them rest for five to eight minutes pour out any burnt oil that remains in the pan but don't clean the pan we want that beautiful beefy fond left in there then add two tablespoons of butter back to the pan heat that over medium heat once it's nice and hot add your vegetables from earlier season to taste with salt and saute until they're cooked to a nice snappy al dente about five minutes or so and we've got all of our stuff set up now all there's left to do is slice that steak of yours you can do it thick or thin up to you just make sure that the cuts are as even as you can make them plate up your beautiful vegetables get your asparagus laid out on a plate top with a generous dressing of your hollandaise such a beautiful site garnish it with some thinly sliced chives little sprinkle of cayenne and some fresh cracked black pepper plate up those mashed potatoes hit it with a fat knob of butter and fresh cracked black pepper some more fresh chives because i freaking love chives now that right there looks like a beautiful classic steak dinner meal with a total price coming to this number right here in comparison to this price from the steakhouse that we went to now i would note that when we went to the steakhouse we did include three drinks so you can take off about 35 from that oh and look at that still winning now let's see if the taste compares as nicely as the cost we got all this all right this is enough for two people three people maybe two huge new york strips a fandy of mashed potato you got a medley of vegetables and you have your classic old school asparagus with hollandaise i like to call these space potatoes because when you take a bite you're gonna go into outer space i have probably four or five videos on steak medium rare basted in butter it's my favorite way to go fatty it's juicy it's salty it's got that classic restaurant steak flavor it's basted in a boatload of butter vegetables you know their vegetables what we did our little filler by cooking it in the same butter that was left behind from the steak you got that brown butter flavor it's meaty beef fat in there and it's also like light refreshing at the same time and last but certainly not least artists you get a perfectly cooked little spear of asparagus the tips are a little crispy it's got some charred flavors to it all of this put together comes together at this price right here now wait you're thinking josh this is but cheaper how is it not one dollar if you think you're gonna make a steak dinner for one dollar you can get the you can turn 360 degrees and get out the point is this price compared to this price astronomical difference you can make it at home just as good as the restaurants this is the secret these are the basic techniques that you need to do to recreate it at home for much less of the cost but do you want to know what else is an extra thicky juicy steakhouse meal b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we went to the restaurant we saw the bill we came back we made the food we compared the prices it's it's astronomically different obviously when you make stuff at home everyone knows that that's probably going to be cheaper i don't want this to seem like some sort of a cop-out but i do want to paint one thing which is i like steakhouses i go there it's it's a fun time to be there with your friends your family i get it i'm not pushing them out completely i don't want to on them for no reason look there's nothing wrong with going to a steakhouse if you're the type of person that may not be able to afford right now to go out to a steakhouse you can have it at home for an affordable cost you can still have that experience for an affordable cost so whether you go or not that's up to you i'm not on anybody but i do want you to know that the option is there all you need is technique and a little bit of know-how want to see more requests for about cheaper we get a lot for butt better but what do you want to see on butt cheaper what do you want to see made cheaper what is something that's commonly expensive that you wish wasn't that price or you don't think is worth that price because i guarantee you we can make it for a lot less so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like

236,236,The Greatest Chicken And Rice Dish To Ever Live (Hainanese Chicken Rice),https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PKvItPZhHjM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLA7ZON9KahadW45AabF3dtuupj7VQ,PKvItPZhHjM,"7 minutes, 13 seconds",We all love a healthy dish of chicken and rice...but there is a very specific kind that I think could end them all as one of the best in the game. I'm talking real deal Hainanese Chicken. ...,2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, the combination of chicken and rice exists all across the world just makes sense as in together and who knew that there was an iteration out there that could be one of the most legendary dishes of all time so we are of course talking about hainan chicken this is the perfect chicken and rice dish i learned about it a long time ago i had to me one of the more proper iterations at one of the restaurants that i used to work at there's a lot of clout behind this dish for good reason it's a whole experience to eat this and you guys know how i feel about food eating experiences if you're an indecisive person this is the perfect dish for you because you have all the options in front of you and you can mix and match however you want the fun never ends so with all that said let's make this shall we as with any chicken recipe we must first address and study our chicken a light pat on the behind always helps more importantly start by removing any excess skin or fat and reserve that on the side there should be a good handful on your lovely bird next you're going to cover the chicken with a lot of kosher salt don't worry about over seasoning here then gently massage your chicken all over it's a spa day for mr chicky so treat him right and get every little crevice exfoliator this cleans up and smooths out the skin nicely like i said exfoliating do not skip after that rinse your chicken off completely then place your whole chicken in a large pot of boiling water be sure to pick one that's large enough to completely submerge the bird this one was actually barely the right size so barely taking my own advice uh sure let that come to a boil skimming any scum that rises to the top if after five minutes is very scummy you can drain it and bring it back to a boil with fresh water but this one didn't need that and it usually doesn't now once that starts to boil immediately reduce the heat to a nice gentle simmer and add in one bunch of green onions cut in half six cloves of lightly crushed whole peeled garlic and a four inch knob of ginger thinly sliced season lightly with salt and let it simmer for 30 minutes optionally you can add one ounce of dried shiitake mushrooms to this if you want the extra flavor now while that's simmering away get the excess skin and fat that you reserved cut it into small pieces sometimes if i have any skin on chicken thighs in the fridge i'll add that skin as well heat a large skillet over medium heat and add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan once the oil is hot add in your chicken skin and fat then let that cook stirring often until it's rendered all of its fat out is golden brown and nice and quiffy remove your lovely skin leaving the fat behind place it on a cutting board and chop very finely then add it back to your pan turn the heat to medium and add a three inch knob of finely chopped ginger one minute shallot and three cloves of minced garlic season that to taste with salt and saute until all the vegetables begin to soften from there add 2 cups of washed rice when i say washed i mean take your rice place it in a sieve over a bowl fill it with water agitate it drain it and repeat one more time if you don't do that i'll tell uncle roger and papa will no longer be able to protect you anyway add that rice to your pan let that cook over medium heat for about 30 seconds during often then add all of that to a rice cooker now wait from here if your chicken into pot is it ready yet let it finish then pull out your chicken and your mushrooms if you added them do not throw away the broth then rub your chicken down with some sesame oil enough to coat all of it tent it with foil and place it to the side then add two cups or 480 milliliters of your broth to the rice don't forget to finger test it obviously then close it and cook according to your rice cooker if you're a real g my rice cooker will be in the links in the description now while that rice is cooking let's make our sauces first sauce is ginger garlic chili start with one and a half tablespoons or 21 grams of granulated sugar dissolve that using two tablespoons or 28 grams of your hot broth then add 3 tablespoons or 50 grams of sambal 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of sriracha the zest and juice of 1 lime 3 cloves of grated garlic and a 2 inch knob of grated ginger whisk all that together and there you go next is a simple seasoned soy mix together a third cup or 78 milliliters of dark soy sauce 1 tablespoon or 14 milliliters of honey and 1

garlic season that generously with salt then add 2 tablespoons or 28 milliliters of neutral tasting oil juice of 1 lime and 2 tablespoons or 28 milliliters of rice vinegar whisk all that together and

Unbeatable right? Or maybe we can make a homemade hash brown that is easy and only 3 ingredients. Maybe we'll win this one at the...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, this one's a big deal we've competed far and wide against many opponents but this one feels like it might be our first real challenge or maybe not [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay welcome back to but better this is episode 21. as a refresher this is the series where we compete against coveted fast foods and junk foods to recreate that item using only classic cooking techniques with the intention to make them better we're going head-to-head with the mcdonald's hashbrown this is arguably one of the most iconic mcdonald's menu items in the world it's that classic sort of i don't know what oval shape i guess it's crunchy it's crispy it's salty it's kind of everything you want i'm not gonna lie this is something that i've actually enjoyed as a kid it has me a little bit a little bit nervous shaky no never we're gonna go in with our culinary mindset and win this one now with all that said let's make this shall we so we made it back to mcdonald's thank you i hate it hi can i get can i get four hashbrowns that's it thank you sorry i almost forgot to say thank you idiot he was so fast can i get a four hashtags uh or a third ring thank you i've always found this two window process to be very strange i feel like they added a step not taking away hi thank you jesus they're so fast i can't complain about that that's like that was fast oh he just spit in the trash can that was weird okay well i guess we'll go eat these hash browns now so we've got the bag i was expecting that to go like this wow josh how did you do that pal right so we're back with this design why do they do this it does it doesn't really doesn't look good it's like oh it's quirky egg mc almost everything we've ever done on this series i don't and have never liked nor have i really eaten that much except for chipotle and thank you for answering i guess we just finished each other's sentences i haven't had this in probably seven years this is what it looks like okay i feel like they're normally more brown than this this seems a little light and it's a little floppy oh my god you know this is not good i swear to god i was really expecting to like this i think that they didn't change their oil out three things one the crust is not as deep and crunchy as it should be two sad it's way too greasy three whatever grease they used here they did not dispose of this at the end of the night where it's been running for way too long and it's super bitter super bitter aftertaste but the salt levels are nice honestly i was actually kind of scared i wasn't sure we're gonna do this but we can do better than this look at the grease splatter on that yeah it tastes like just old grease okay this is a beautifully perfect recipe potatoes duck fat and salt that's all you need although duck fat is highly preferred you can switch it out for b-fat or lard but it must be a fat that can handle high temps and solidify when chill anyway you'll need two pounds or one kilo of russet potatoes rinse them and peel them like all their skins no skins at all please using a box grater grate each and every one of your beautiful little potato baby baby babies yeah then place your gratings in a large bowl you'll want to move quickly here to avoid any sort of oxidation next cover your potatoes with water and agitate them to rinse off any excess starch drain the water from the potatoes and place your potato shreds in a clean cloth how many times we're gonna say potato probably more than i would like to gather up the sides of your cloth wind it around to tighten the cloth around the potatoes and wring out the excess liquid it's gonna require some good old-fashioned elbow grease so really get that liquid out of there in a large heavy bottom pot add three and a half quarts or roughly three and a half liters of duck fat along with your potatoes and yes while it's all cold oh yeah and yet again realize that you should have gotten that larger pot that you were eyeing earlier the proper size for the pot was about seven quarts by the way now if the shape of that pot doesn't quite get the potatoes completely covered in duck fat you can certainly supplement additional vegetable oil just until it's covered place that pot under the stove over medium heat and let that heat up from cold stirring occasionally until it reaches 215 degrees fahrenheit or 100 degrees celsius once it's gotten there you now have duck fat confit potatoes immediately strain the oil out of your potatoes reserve your fat to the side then pour your drained potatoes onto a large baking sheet to spread them out season them to taste with salt and make sure to season them very generously we want them perfectly salty perfectly not too much not too little don't be afraid to taste it a few times while doing so once your potatoes are cool enough to handle line a baking sheet or in my case two-quarter sheet trays with wax paper then form your potatoes by hand into that classic hash brown oval shape onto your wax paper the dimensions were around two and a half inches wide three and a half inches long and about three quarters of an inch thick and make sure to pack your potatoes tightly together otherwise they'll open up when fry once you're done shaping all of your potatoes take those bad boys and place them in the fridge to chill overnight the next day heat your reserved duck fat over medium heat until it reaches about 355 degrees fahrenheit or 180 celsius carefully lowering your hash browns and fry from cold in your oil for about three to six minutes i don't recommend doing more than two at a time by the way the first minute of frying is its most crucial if the oil is not hot enough then it won't form a crust fast enough and it could fall apart once your hash brown is a gorgeous deep golden brown and nicely crisp transfer it to a wire rack to cool if you season your potatoes enough no further salt is required then just repeat your frying process with all of your hash browns and that's really it if you want any sauces with this you could make a simple herby mayo by combining a quarter cup of fresh chopped parsley one tablespoon of dijon mustard a third cup of creme fraiche half a cup of mayo and one clove of grated garlic and of course salt and pepper to taste you whisk that together you know or you could even make a spicy ketchup with one cup of ketchup three and a half tablespoons of sriracha and one and a half tablespoons of a hot sauce of your choice mix that together and that's the spicy cage up now let's look back at this hash brown this is a gorgeous piece of work right here i mean look at it compared to the mcdonald's there's definitely some similarities but i think we flexed on them so hard that before we taste and decide the winner we might as well go a step further and build a fancy restaurant version you know i'm talking like hit it with some dots of creme fraiche some guajillo sauce some regal cetera caviar i get mine from regalis the link is in the description some thinly sliced burgundy black truffle which is also from brugalis and finish it with a new assortment of fresh dainty little herbs now look that was just for the flex and i'm not sorry about it but i think it's time that we taste test and decide the winner i'll be honest with you i wasn't really sure if we were gonna be able to do this one but you know what just looking at these two i think we did it first off sound bite there are only a few times in life that you're able to enjoy something this good this isn't just a hash brown no this isn't just a quippy no this isn't just a butt better this is history this is a michelin star even though i don't actually have any michelin stars yeah i deserve one for this i i i met we won like i'm not i don't even want to i don't even want to sugarcoat this we won the shh out of this get the hell out of here yo get this dude get this dude yourself vikram i'm excited [Laughter] [Music] now we're gonna do a little twist here's number one i'm gonna put it anything that's number one here's number two you already know number one is better the funny thing is they've both been sitting equally as long mine just stayed crispy that long so anyone who's anyone who's like josh who sat and got sad no these these have all this one was fried when like virtually right after you got here okay this one this has been sitting here for an almost one hour so good you understand this sauce is also great this one was a landslide um i think this is one of my most prideful moments of all time but better episode 21 hash browns from mcdonald's get slapped do you want to know what else is beautifully crunchy and round for your mouth hole [Music] b-roll [Music] [Music] guys and that is it so we don't did it brother we don't want to do this this was a knock out of the park i could not be happier with the outcome and and also it even has sort of a fine dining element to it which i really really enjoy you got the duck fat confit potatoes which are then double fried they rest overnight i mean and yet at the same time despite that fancy quality it's literally potatoes salt and duck fat that is all you need that is it you don't need anything else okay so i don't want to hear anything josh is too expensive but josh is stupid i don't have this or dab if you have a pot some fat it's a potato and well a grater and peeler these are all basic things so the excuse is over you can now make a mcdonald's hash brown but 10 billion times better so you're welcome before we go i want to mention that we have merch coming very very soon i've been going back and forth with designs i've got a couple pieces of apparel that are coming out that are very relevant to the times the weather per se but if there's anything that you want to see on this merch let me know in the comments in the description put the comment in the place where it belongs all

A simple birria de res con consomme, atop a beautiful quesataco...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, this is a really special one not very many people have a local place that can make something like this for you that is until today or well you're the one who had have to make it but yeah today we're going to be making video tacos now let's talk about this there are a lot of ways to make this there's a very specific way that i prefer them which is with the consomme which is technically not like the consummate that i'm imagining the consummate i imagine is like clarified in french you essentially get a rich sort of slightly thick soup that you then dunk these meaty rich fatty cheesy tacos but we're not just gonna do tacos we're gonna make them quesa tacos it's a quesadilla and a taco what more could you possibly want you've seen images of this dish all over the web it's taking the internet by storm and there's a good reason for it it's one of my favorite taco dishes of all time so with all that said let's make this shall we right so beeria is traditionally served at celebratory occasions so that goes to show the amount of attention to detail and love that goes into this pay close attention first we're gonna snag us five ancho chilis five guajillo chilis and two chili de arbol de arbol if you want me to pronounce it all right take those dried boys remove their stems and de-seed them the original video is typically made with goat meat which is lovely but i decided to opt for beef on this hence therese de res you'll need one pound of boneless chuck roast three large beef short ribs with the bone attached or one pound of boneless short ribs and two large slices of ox tail about one pound as well see what we're doing it's it's even amounts one pound one pound one pound season those all generously with salt in a large pot add enough oil to coat the bottom something high heat like canola and heat over medium high heat until screaming hot add your meat in batches and sear about two to three minutes on all sides until you get a nice beautiful deep brown crust all over each piece of meat repeat with all of your meat placing it to the side as you work look color is so important here please no gray meat all right this isn't grey's anatomy now look at that lovely fond on the bottom of the pot that's what you want now to squirt of any burned oil left in the bottom add another couple tablespoons of neutral tasting fresh oil place that back onto medium heat then add one chopped yellow onion saute that just until begins to soften then add 1 tablespoon or 12 grams of tomato paste cook that down until the paste begins to darken and stick to the pan then add 8 cloves of sliced garlic saute until fragrant then add two and a half quarts or 2.25 liters of a rich beef stock please make your beef stock for this all right i'm tired of saying it it's the heart and soul to so much of the flavor here also uh you know maybe get a pot that's big enough because papa did not and now he has an extra dish to clean thanks to his negligence from there add your dried chilies then separately get a piece of cheesecloth and in the center add one tablespoon or eight grams of black peppercorns one tablespoon or five grams of toasted coriander one cinnamon stick and six bay leaves fold all the sides together and tie tightly with cheesecloth and now you have a little sachet of flavor toss that in your stew bring that up to a light simmer and cover it with a lid and braise for one hour stirring occasionally once that hour is up fish out them chilies then place them in a blender along with a cup or two of your liquid and blend until smooth you'll get a nice vibrant orange puree pour that back in your stew bring it back up to a simmer then place the lid on and braise for an additional one and a half hours or until your meat is so tender that it jiggles at the mere sight of your lips now remove the meat discard of any bones and shred the meat and fat together as chunky or as fine as you'd like i like mine sort of medium fine you know some chunks for variants but mostly nice and thready and emulsified with its fat season your leftover broth with salt leave it to the side it's also called consomme but not to be confused with the clarified french stock known as well consummate now we're ready to assemble our quesad tacos but first let me have a brief discussion with you in order to pair respects properly do yourself a favor and get oaxaca cheese it is in my opinion the best way to enjoy these you just can't have these without buhaka cheese and be sure to tear it into little threads like this both for easy melting and some childhood string cheese like nostalgia anyway use the freshest corn tortillas you can find corn tortilla guide coming soon i swear then dunk your corn tortilla in the broth completely which should have a vibrant thick layer of reddish orange fat floating on top that'll coat the tortilla nicely and when dunking try to be careful when you're holding onto these or else place it on a medium cast iron skillet set over medium heat top that with a generous amount of your shredded oaxaca cheese let that cook just until the cheese is nice and melted a blow torch helps too then on one side of your tortilla add a generous helping of your braised shredded meat drizzle a large spoonful of your consummate onto your meat really let it soak it up fold your taco over and let it cook for one to three minutes flip and toast the other side until both of the sides have been toasted nicely and the cheese is completely melted finally to serve these bad boys get a small ramekin or bowl fill it with your broth or well consummate top with some finely diced sweet onion and rough chopped cilantro and all that's left to do is get your melty meaty little man dunk it in your consummate and let all of your problems fade away these tacos are coveted by both the culinarian world and the internet for a very good reason so without further ado the proper way to eat these is to talk you want it to be messy all right don't be a little baby only a little baby can be a little baby you ever think about that okay i got kate to stop talking anyway i have to get in the mood again i'm sorry oh that gets you in the mood all right you have the exterior crunch and yet subtly soft soaked the spicy fatty stew the meat is ultra tender the cheese is ultra cheesy that you know it's a quesadilla in a taco quesada that's what it is i'm not gonna claim that this is ultra authentic traditional i'm sure that there's gonna be some grandmother that's watching this it's like oh my god this white guy is being white again all i have to say is you if you don't have something like this in your area this is as close as you might be able to get it home with pretty low effort that's something to be proud of i hope that's helpful but do you want to know what else is voluptuous juicy and packed full of meat [Music] b-roll all right guys and that is it so we made video tacos well queso tacos technically this is actually shockingly easy yes there's a there's wait time for the cooking but this this is something that everybody on the planet can make and should make really seriously if you've never had this before and you don't have the chance you don't have a local place maybe you live in canada and there's nowhere maybe you're like in i don't know some like midwestern state that people forget the name of but anyway you need to make this please take it from me this is a beautiful thing to make for your family for yourself it's enjoyable it's it's good times bro so anyway if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time oh wait i have to close the camera

But what if you could just take an extra 15 minutes at home and instead end up only forking over 2 dollars or less? 

Recipe:...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, so you go to go get pasta and it's 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 i've got three different kinds for less than two dollars per serving that is but cheaper so [Music] whenever i go out to eat i will order pasta if i'm at a great restaurant of course a good restaurant makes great pasta it's always worth the money but usually it's like 18 20 and you can make this stuff at home for a fraction of the price so it's a perfect but cheaper candidate while we're here talking about it uh you me and ntg oh my gosh [Music] romanticism we're gonna talk about three different ways to make a great pasta as cheaply as physically possible i could go on and on about pasta rather than talking about it i think we should be about it and let's do this shall we right so before we get started i'd like to mention pasta shape dried spaghetti works excellent with all these sauces and is an ultra cheap one to two dollar per pound option anyway sauce number one is a chef and home cook favorite marcello hazaan's classic onion butter tomato sauce in a medium sauce pot add a 28 ounce can of peeled roma tomatoes the sento brand cost me about three bucks but you could go even cheaper here if you want add in one whole onion that's been sliced in half peeled with the root still attached and 5 tablespoons or 70 grams of unsalted butter give it a light seasoning of salt to taste and a small pitch of sugar then place it on a stove over medium heat bring that up to a gentle simmer and lower the heat to medium low simmer that for 45 minutes stirring occasionally mashing the whole pieces of tomato against the wall of the pan until you get a lovely sauce like this then simply remove the onion discard it and adjust the salt levels to your taste from there you can boil one pound of spaghetti or bucatini to a nice al dente texture it should be al dente all right that's the right way and make sure to season your pasta water generously with salt i want this bad boy as salty as the ocean then toss your drained pasta in all of your tomato sauce with a little splash of reserved pasta water then plate that up and enjoy with some fresh shaved parmigiano reggiano should you desire it now not including the cheese this bad boy sits at a solid 1.60 cents per serving the cheese tacks on like another 30 cents to a dollar right so next up we've got a surprise alfredo which is shockingly affordable to make in a large saucepan add four tablespoons or 56 grams of unsalted butter heat over medium heat till melted and boom blend then add one cup or 240 milliliters of heavy cream bring that to a nice simmer and let that simmer away for about one to two minutes or till emulsified and beginning to slightly thicken then turn off the heat and whisk in one and a half cups or 110 grams of finely grated parmigiano-reggiano keep whisking until completely melted and emulsified then finish with two cloves of freshly grated garlic some fresh cracked black pepper and salt to taste separately boil one pound of a nice wide noodle such as pepperdill then just toss that with your sauce along with a splash or two of pasta water and serve that bad boy with some extra cheese and black pepper on top bone apple tea to you too last but certainly not least is both a friend to our wallet as it is to our heart and souls pasta how was that italians did i do good let me know can't wait to get yelled at very excited now go ahead and boil yourself one pound of spaghetti or does the italian say spaghetti all right i'm getting out of myself here don't forget to heavy season that water by the way now when your pasta is almost done in a large saute pan add a third cup or 80 ml of extra virgin olive oil heat that over medium heat till hot it's a lot of heating then add seven cloves of very finely chopped garlic and one teaspoon or 5 grams of red pepper flakes saute that beauty until fragrant and ice about 3 minutes now once your pasta is done reserve about half a cup of the pasta water drain your pasta and add it immediately to your hot oil turn off the heat and toss aggressively splashing with a little pasta water until you've got a nice coating of oil season that generously with salt to taste and finish with half a cup or 12 grams of very finely chopped fresh parsley pleat that bad boy up nice and tall feel free to grate some parm on top should you desire it and that right there is one of the simplest yet greatest pasta dishes of all time so we have three pastas that each have plenty of wallet saving potential and you can add your budget protein of choice if you wish but now i think it's time that we talk about how they taste it's a bust the time pasta alloy olio this is perhaps the most affordable easy to make pasta in all of history with all that said that puts this plate of pasta at this number right here this is something everyone should know how to make and if you don't already and i've talked about it before so has our boy babish baby i love you so uh let's dig in oh my god pasta alio aeolio encompasses although a tongue twister sings harmonies on your tongue as well that doesn't make sense it's got all the qualities you want in a plate of pasta it's rich but not too rich it's garlicky but in a subtle way there's a little bit of kick from the garlic there's a little bit of spice from the the red pepper flakes and there's a little bit of chew from the pasta it's a good pot this is what a pasta should be this takes 10 minutes take the damn time alfredo this is something that i think a lot of kids hold near and dear to their heart you know you go out with your your family it's a saturday night school not happening what even is school abc's i don't know but one thing you are looking forward to is the alfredo that's finna hit right in front of you that could have broken if your alfredo doesn't do that i don't want it on your first bite you're gonna ask why did i ever pay 17 for this so simple so easy ingredients that aren't really even that expensive there's nothing exotic about it and it's not that hard to make five minutes of boiling and simmering and stirring and you're that's what you're paying 17 for when you go out so this comes in at this price per serving now granted that's without chicken but like you incorporate chicken you might tack on a dollar or two to that big whoop much better than uh than 17. this is one that i've talked to you guys about before i hold this very near and dear to my heart a lot of the italian cooking that i learned when i was a young kid was from marcella hazan marcella shout out to her this is her classic everyone knows this the og onion and butter tomato sauce so simple makes you want to cry obviously the simplicity in the ingredients this is going to automatically make it cheap but the key point is this is a perfectly balanced like you take a bite and you're like balancing right but it's perfectly balanced so you're not doing that i don't know where i'm going with the analogy the sweetness from the onion combats the over acidity of the tomato so it's nice and smooth tasting it's salty it's got richness from the butter this is truly perfect tomato sauce and you can make the whole darn thing less than six dollars and fifty cents but you wanna know what else has nice nudes and is coated in sauce b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made three different kinds of pasta alfredo pasta argo olio and what was the third one again how could i forget marcela hazaan's greatest tomato sauce of all time it's so beautifully simple and cheap there's a message here and the message is simple ingredients cared for it's not supposed to be expensive it's just beauty and simplicity technique and a little bit of love bruv i hope you learned something also i i keep having the the conversation back and forth about being in the cabinet not in the cabinet we're out of the cabin again because sometimes we remember to put the camera here and sometimes we don't so you tell us what you want to see in the comments below so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you

container or a bowl add 150 grams of golden syrup then mix it in 50 grams of sunflower or peanut oil and half a teaspoon or two grams of consuelo also known as lye water this stuff right here specifically you can also get it in asian market or amazon you know lots of places whisk all that together and then separately in a bowl with one and a half cups or 220 grams of all-purpose flour add in your oily golden syrup stuff then just knead that together until completely incorporated and you get a smooth little dough now cover that with plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes and up to four hours now let's talk filling we have two options red bean paste or lotus seed paste both very traditional either way they both need to be soaked before doing this just be sure to split your lotus seeds and remove any green stems in the center now for the lotus you'll need 320 grams of lotus seeds and for the red bean paste you'll need about 200 grams of red beans also known as adzuki beans simply cover those with water then with plastic wrap and let them sit at room temp overnight fun fact lotus seeds are also the same thing that we all saw in that weird trypophobia ad on websites in like 2010 so there you go anyway once they've been soaked drain them of their water and whether you're doing red bean or lotus place whichever you're using in a pot cover with water and bring to a boil boil that bad boy for 45 minutes to an hour or until very soft and mushy gushy be sure to stir occasionally unless you want to scorch your beans which is a no no so don't do that next you're going to blend your red bean or your lotus seed on high speed until beautifully smooth this will take some power and try to resist adding any more liquid just utilize the tamper to get everything smooth okay a food processor works fine too by the way now for the red bean add your puree to a medium non-stick skillet set to medium heat and gradually add 150 grams of granulated sugar and 120 grams of peanut or sunflower oil mixing in between to incorporate until all of it's added continue mixing and cooking until it becomes nice and thick like you see here finally mix in two tablespoons or 24 grams of corn starch then just keep mixing and heating for a couple more minutes until thick and it can do this then cool that bad boy down all the way for the lotus seed paste add to your non-stick pan over medium heat again this time cook this guy dry stirring frequently until it starts to thicken a little and begins to stop sticking to the pan then add 200 grams of powdered sugar and 250 grams of oil peanut or sunflower alternating each until all of it is added and mixed in then just continue to cook and stir until thickened and lovely like so do some fun little tricks because this stuff looks kind of funny then let it cool completely once your moon cake dough is ready divide it into 40 gram pieces then roll each of those pieces by hand into nice little balls so cute a little baby separately roll out 50 gram balls of whichever paste you made make sure to weigh this stuff out by the way it's really important to the shape and size size batteries here today boys now in order to shape these you're gonna need a moon cake press they're pretty cheap and i got mine on amazon there'll be a link in the description for the one that i have now take one of your balls and roll it out in between two sheets of plastic wrap until it's about an eighth of an inch thick and four inches wide remove the top layer of plastic wrap place a paste ball in the center that sounds gross gather up the sides of your plastic wrap and squeeze the edges together to encase the ball in dough then feel free to remove any excess dough that's on the crease end lightly dust it with cornstarch placing the seam side down and press with a 100 gram sized mooncake mold just be careful to avoid squeezing the filling out once that's tamped down i like to press it an additional 7 to 10 times to really get that good print you know you want a nice print then just pop out that little man and look how beautiful it is place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and repeat with the rest of your moon cakes by the way you can definitely freeze any extra paste you have left over now once you have your mooncakes give them a light misting with water and place them in an oven set to 375 fahrenheit or 190 celsius for five minutes then remove and brush with an egg wash consisting of one egg yolk and one teaspoon of water be sure to brush them very very lightly like a microscopic layer of wash reduce the oven temp to 325 fahrenheit or 160 celsius then back into the oven for five more minutes pull them out and give them an ultra light brushing one more time if you over brush you're gonna lose the pattern all right now back into the oven for 10 to 13 more minutes or until beautifully golden brown like this i mean come on look at that absolutely stunning broth now let that cool completely on a wire rack and they're good to eat now but i'd recommend covering them in plastic wrap and letting them rest overnight and up to three days they get that classic mooncake softness that everybody loves so just a little tip of the day now with that said i think we need to taste this okay so normally you would let these rest overnight wrapped in plastic wrap because that's how you get that classic soft melt in your mouth crust that makes you want to cry but for the sake of time we're gonna go ahead and eat it now this is the red bean paste now obviously you could add a salted egg yolk to either of these whether it's the lotus or the bean you can add salted egg yolk to either i know people are going to be mad at me like yes you didn't add an egg yolk oh my god papa doesn't like the egg yolk hey that's my own personal preference and that's allowed oh well i'm i'm like at a loss this is the kind of thing that makes you go i can't believe i did that in front of my mom yay it's my helper for the day everybody get around them cause it's so exciting she doesn't like red bean paste but i made it though oh okay i like it josh it's good it's clean right i like this a lot that's the winner she likes it as for the lotus paste it's like luxurious this is the mercedes-benz the rolls-royce of moon cakes lotus seed most people don't even make their own lotus seed paste anymore i'm weird that's really tasty we got a low seed so whether you celebrate the mid-autumn festival or not it doesn't matter you should make yourself some moon cakes do it for the moon do it for you but for the most part do it so you could eat yummy yummy you want to know what else is a beautifully ornate little pastry maya b-roll [Music] all right guys so we made moon cakes i think they came out beautiful so we had two traditional fillings we have the lotus seed paste and we have the red bean paste now obviously you can use many many other things the world is your oyster if you want to do chocolate do chocolate you want to do matcha do matcha it's up to you but these are great bass lines to start at if you've never done it before i'd really recommend following along here and then freestyling as you go the one thing that i learned from making these was it's not really that hard but you really have to follow the directions that i've given you there were a couple tricks that i tried to make happen to make this a little bit faster and just long story short it didn't end that well as long as you follow along you're gonna have a great time so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] huh [Music]

Here it is to quell your hunger in perpetuity. 

Making a Chipotle Burrito at Home: https://youtu.be/n76noIAaAu...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, okay so the taco bell mexican pizza is leaving their menu permanently do i care no but i know there's a lot of people who do and i'd like to be of assistance [Music] okay so welcome back to butt better episode 21 time flies when you're having fun this has been highly requested as of recently i was never going to do this period but because so many people are asking for it and it's leaving their menu forever i thought you know what let's just immortalize a recipe that is the highest level that a taco bell mexican pizza could be in the form of well this video one one last thing i would notice it's just that in the world of traditional mexican cuisine this is not a real thing as far as what i've researched really all it is is maybe inspired by a tostada with cheese on it that's melted uh i don't know culturally speaking i don't know how i feel about this but we're doing it for you we're doing it for the people who've asked and we're doing it to help those who are going to be sad that this is leaving their menu so with all that said let's make this shall we wow it's the same taco bell kfc that we went to for the famous bowl stinky bowl here we go i hope it's not like the last drive three one two that was depressing can i get uh two mexican pizzas sorry what oh two mexican pizzas okay what else are you oh that's it sweet mix can be thank you i like the little mini laundry basket thank you why is it so big how big are these things it smells like kfc [Music] we're back with the phone so this is tough for a lot of people because this is supposed to be leaving the menu forever and people are sad about it really this is what you're sad about what is this it's a tortilla fried with okay i'll stop talking and i'll just try it so this is definitely flour tortilla so it's like nachos it's just like a big nacho okay two things if i were to decide on whether it's good or bad i would say it's in the middle it's not bad it's not good it's just kind of like yeah this is what i about what i expected so i'm not underwhelmed i'm not disappointed it just is what it is um this is so boring and such an easy thing we could make at home that we might as well actually make it exciting let us begin our journey with the sauce we've all got sauce in us so let's bring it out in a 12 inch skillet heat over medium heat add in six ancho chilies and five guajillo chilies dry toast those for about 30 to 40 seconds or till fragrant but not blackened then remove from the pan and separately you're gonna slice three roma tomatoes in half and quarter one sweet onion but leave the root attached so it doesn't get all floppy and annoying get enough oil in your pan just to coat the bottom and heat over medium-high heat till very hot in batches char each of those vegetables cut side down while tomatoes have fruit but you get the point make sure to do this in one layer until you get a light char on every surface once all that is charred rough chop your onion leaving the root behind this time toss that in your pan with a tablespoon of oil along with your tomatoes five cloves of rough chopped garlic one tablespoon or six grams of chopped fresh oregano saute just for a minute then add your dried chilies and only to realize your pan is way too small upgrade to a larger and more beautiful pan then add just enough water to cover bring that up to a light simmer and optionally you can add a cartouche which i did here but is not entirely necessary now just simmer that until all the veg is super soft and the chillies tear easily now fish all your solids out place them in a blender and begin blending on high speed add a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of white vinegar and potentially you may need to add some additional cooking liquid to loosen it properly once that's vortexing it's smooth stream in three tablespoons of neutral tasting oil continue to blend until beautifully emulsified then season generously with salt and about 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of grated pinella if you've got it now next we got our beans despite the lackluster sound of the name these are very special in a medium-sized sauce pot add three tablespoons or 42 grams of unsalted butter heat that over medium heat once melted in bubbling add two sliced jalapenos one diced yellow onion four cloves of rough chopped garlic then hit that with some kosher salt and saute for about three to four minutes or until softened then add two cans of black beans and one and a half cups or 350 milliliters of chicken stock bring that up to a simmer and let that simmer until your veg is completely soft i mean like mushy soft from there you're going to drain out your beans but be sure to reserve that by your bean juice now add your solids to the blender and blend while constantly tamping down using a tiny bit of liquid if needed to loosen but you don't want this too loose alright it's going to take a lot of tamping you know a little bit of an arm workout don't be shy so you get a nice thick and smooth puree adjust your salt levels and we're almost ready here now for your meat the easiest choice would be ground beef heat a dry stainless pan over medium high press in one pound of ground beef to coat the whole surface and let that sear until you get a nice brown crust flip and then repeat on the other side be sure to season it a taste with salt then using a potato masher mash the beef until you get fine little pieces like so let that continue to cook and render out its fat until nice brown and crispy or quit b whatever i don't i i feel like i say that too much now from here you can add any seasonings or spices you want i hit this with some dark soy sauce and two cloves of rough chopped garlic now if you don't want to use ground beef you can really use any meat here for example if you wanted to use a5 okinawa wagyu seared to absolute perfection and then sliced so beautifully that it makes it feel like life is a movie you could do that too not saying i did but i did and by the way if you want to know where i sourced this i got it from my homies at regales foods this isn't a paid sponsorship i just like them and i get exotic ingredients from them now as for our tostada use the same homemade flour tortilla recipe as my chipotle burrito video the link will be in the description for that this time it really will be okay get yourself a five quart pot and fill it up about halfway with canola oil heat that bad boy to 350 degrees fahrenheit or 175 degrees celsius then one at a time drop a tortilla in there laying away from yourself unless you want to get a nice little splash to the face with hot oil feels good that's a joke don't do that very dangerous fry that for one to two minutes or until it begins to get a little bit stiff then flip her over and fry on the other side for another minute or two or until the bubbling subsides and stiff throughout drain on a wire rack set of our baking sheet and immediately season these with salt while they're still hot and repeat with the rest of your hurricane tortillas okay so now we're ready to assemble grab a fried tortilla and spread on your black beans hit that with a drizzle of your chili sauce add your ground beef and top with another fried tortilla now on top that you're gonna add a generous amount of grated cheese this is a mix of cheddar and monterey jack not sure you could boil this that's that's that's very civilian of you but you could also just melt it with a big blow torch the link in the description for mine will be there as well add another drizzle of your chili sauce followed by some fresh crumbled cotija cheese pickled red onions and garnished with some fresh cilantro leaves now just by looking at these two i mean yeah tb is in trouble here today what do we even call mine i really dislike the original name josh's weird cheesy tostada that's much better than taco bells okay so visually yet again this is one of those things where we've got this beautiful tostada not much to say so listen carefully you know when you try something for the first time and you eat it and you're just like the flavor the texture there's depth to it i actually think this could use a little more sauce you know you just take it a little bottle of your sauce squirt it on there like that a symphony as usual i'm biased i always feel like we won so we need a taste tester vikram today is your day to shine man all right today you're gonna dodge a knife i peed only a bit so number one i'm gonna place it in your hand give that a little you can that's fine sure okay carefully all right yeah it was this one you already i mean it's so obvious which one's mine because it's so much fatter yeah this one has so much more depth i mean it's not a competition this is miles miles that i don't even like beans but these these are some good beans long story short ours is a little bit messier but at the end of the day we won i know the first thing people are going to say is like but josh i could just go through the drive-through it's so much easier no you can't because it's gonna be gone in november forever so you will make this right but do you wanna know what won't be leaving the menu permanently b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made the taco bell mexican pizza i can't believe i'm saying this ugh it wasn't that hard honestly this was a very easy one um it's it's look it's it's fried tortillas with cheese beans and meat uh did we take it way higher than it needed to be of course we did why would we not i think it turned out fantastic obviously the the the layers of texture and flavor were just way above the taco bell version and way more in depth there's no question about it but if you want to make this you should do it because it's really not that difficult to put together there's a lot of steps you can eliminate steps by having stuff pre-made if you want to do that like you could you don't have to make your tortillas if you don't want to we're working on a brand new series that we're going to be dropping as soon as we possibly can i'll keep it under wraps for now but we'll be you'll see it soon enough now with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time

NYC Cheesecake is the easiest and most delicious dessert you can make at home. With a few simple techniques...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, cheesecake has to be one of the most generalized terms in baking history a cake of cheese that could either be really problematic or really good let's just remember that there can only be one true king [Music] i bet you didn't know this but cheesecake predates new york by quite a bit and by that i mean the ancient greeks literally made cheesecake obviously not with cream cheese so it took a couple hundred years to uh get it to the point where it is today then around sort of 1872 so like a couple days ago a dude from chester new york came up with cream cheese completely by accident so you know we can thank him for both fantastic bagels as well as the cheesecake like i said there's many cheesecakes from across the world and we're going to be making an american classic but you want to know what else is an american classic well b-roll but also geico insurance they've been helping folks save money for over 75 years and they're pretty good at it now you can combine your home and car insurance which could save you even more now for bundling made easy visit geico.com today head to the link in the description to see how much you can save and with all that said let's do this shall we right so we're going to start off with a nice graham cracker crust if you want to make your graham crackers from scratch so you can flex on all your friends and remind them who the alpha of the group is then you can find it in my key lime pie video otherwise you're gonna start off with one and a quarter cup or 161 grams of finely crushed graham crackers to that you're gonna add two tablespoons or 30 grams of granulated sugar one teaspoon or two grams of kosher salt optionally some fresh ground nutmeg whisk all that together nicely then mix in a quarter cup or 56 grams of melted unsalted butter till thoroughly incorporated it should clump together nicely generously grease a nine-inch springform pan with oil this is a crucial step a non-greased springform pan will ruin your entire life guaranteed now pour all your graham cracker crumble into the springform pan and using a flat bottomed cup or a measuring cup press the mixture firmly to form a nice flat even surface like this this isn't the surface of the moon it's a pie crust keep it flat now toss it into an oven that's been preheated to 350 degrees fahrenheit or 175 celsius for eight minutes then remove it and let it cool completely for the batter you're gonna need a large mixing bowl for that maximum mixing space then toss in 32 ounces or 900 grams of softened cream cheese that's four eight ounce blocks total now using electric beaters beat that together with one cup or 220 grams of granulated sugar this is a lot easier if your cream cheese has been sufficiently softened now once that's nice and creamed add in four whole eggs one at a time blending them in between each followed by one whole egg yolk beat all that together till incorporated then add a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of heavy cream a quarter cup or 57 grams of creme fraiche 2 teaspoons or 7 grams of vanilla extract a small pinch of salt and finally 2 tablespoons or 20 grams of corn starch once all that is beautifully incorporated and smooth like this you're good to go pour your cheesecake mixture into your completely cooled or you'll make papa mad if no cool graham cracker crust make sure to wrap the bottom of your springform pan with foil to keep water from getting into it place your cheesecake into the bottom of a roasting dish or a large baking dish pour enough boiling water into your dish to come one inch up the springform pan place that lovely into an oven preheated to 325 fahrenheit for one and a half hours or till set but still slightly jiggly in the center now this is the biggest secret to keeping it from cracking at this point once it's done open your oven door and let it cool in the oven left in the water bath for 45 minutes or until the water bath is completely cool then remove it and place it on a wire rack to cool the rest of the way once that's cooled completely place it in your fridge overnight and up to two to three days before serving now at this point you just need to slice your cheesecake carefully and potentially stressfully remove your cheesecake from the springform pan and place it on a board to slice i'd recommend wetting a sharp knife with warm water prior to every slice then slice up your cheesecake and obviously you can eat it as is but we're gonna go above and beyond here to make a simple strawberry compote take one pound of fresh strawberries and cut all them in half obviously remove their tops too please then toss them in a medium sauce pot with half a cup or 110 grams of granulated sugar let that sit for about 15 minutes then turn the heat to medium as the juices leach out and it begins to bubble up let it boil and reduce for 10 minutes or till syrupy take a third of that and blend it in a blender or with a hand blender till smooth then mix that back in with the rest of your compote and serve on top of your beautifully smooth cheesecake now let's see how we did here so we've got our classic near cheesecake uh well i had to cut this one for the b-roll so i do this for you and because we don't waste food i'll eat that piece you're welcome this is probably one of the creamiest cheesecakes i've ever made in my life so let us begin this is the smoothest this texture this goes dummy it is so rich so creamy this is this is smooth i'm like tongue tied on this no roughness no crumbliness smooth through and through people think this is so hard but even if you're gonna make your first new york cheesecake of all time you've ever done this is the one all right one more thing nine times out of ten you're gonna have leftover cheesecake so what do we do with that well i'd recommend that you take that lovely leftover cheesecake cut off all of its crust then cut it into nice even one and a half inch cubes like so place those onto a tray and freeze until solid you can also leave them in the freezer until you want them now once you're ready get a medium sized bowl and combine one and a quarter cup 185 grams of all-purpose flour a quarter cup or 55 grams of granulated sugar 1 teaspoon or 5 grams of baking powder 1 teaspoon or 4 grams of salt whisk all that together till thoroughly combined then whisk in 1 cup or 240 milliliters of whole milk continue whisking until you get a nice well-hydrated batter like this then simply take your frozen cheesecake cubes dunk them into your batter and drop them into a small pot of oil that's been heated to around 350 fahrenheit or 175 celsius let those fry for about three to four minutes flipping occasionally or until beautifully golden brown like these that's genuinely it then just spider them out and let them cool slightly on a wire rack and to serve you're gonna top them off with a nice dusting of powdered sugar i also blended up the rest of my strawberry compote to use as a sauce to drizzle on these which was actually a very nice addition and i do not regret but aside from that is fried cheesecake even worthy enough to be eaten obviously it is but we're gonna taste it fried cheesecake balls if this isn't gluttony at its finest i don't know what is it's just kind of gross but in a good way it's almost like a beignet like a cheesecake filled beignet it has that classic cheesecake flavor that we experienced prior but redefined a new texture it's crunchy it's fried the point is don't let your cheesecake go to waste do something nice with it give it some love some little kisses by treating it this way well this looks sad now but then you have essentially deep fried cheesecake or a cheesecake donut if you will thank you do you want to know what else is cheesy and belongs in your mouth b-roll [Music] do all right guys and that is it thank you again to geico for sponsoring this episode they're helping me with my culinary journey around the united states and they want to help you too by helping you save money on your home and car insurance so head down to the link below and visit geico.com today so let's talk cheesecake for one we snapped on this we absolutely snapped i know a lot of people are scared to make cheesecake there's no reason to be it seems like something finicky and a lot of people try to skip the water bath and they're like oh no i don't want to mess with the water bath look it's really not that difficult it adds maybe two minutes to your whole assembly and cook time it's it's very very very not frilly and it saves you from having a cracked cheesecake let this be your pushing off point to finally make your own new york cheesecake and be proud anyway pride love kisses pop i love

243,243,$30 Charcuterie Board vs $130 Charcuterie Board | But Cheaper,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2oYRPD5UBPM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBrU7Y7jY-bsbpgWv3oaqWT2sIEpQ,2oYRPD5UBPM,"8 minutes, 55 seconds","Charcuterie boards have a tendency to be overly expensive. I’m talking about dropping between $100-$300 on a single board! And yeah, I understand the quality of food you’re buying is worth...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, i think charcuterie reports are associated with two things an 86 wallet and the benefit being a large assortment of food but i think you can still have that large assortment that fits within just about anyone's budget that is charcuterie but cheaper [Music] so [Music] okay so today we're working with charcuterie boards meat and cheese boards cured meatboards with the board boards usually whenever i personally make a charcoal reward and i'm going all out some of the stuff i'll make and obviously some of the cured meats that you know or take literal months i've yet to make my own prosciutto but uh that's that's coming trust me typically i end up spending anywhere between 100 to 300 for a giant spread and that's to feed a lot of people for the record but still i think at this point the assumption is that is a requirement if you want to make a charcuterie board and i'm here to tell you that that's just not true so with all that said let's make this shall we okay so we're first gonna break this down into categories meat cheese crunch pickle slash briny and sweet slash fruity let's first start with cheese for the more expensive side we've got gouda or ghauda for those who are dutch and are going to yell at me brie classic triple creme now this is tome right this is a french cheese it is made with goat's milk it's beautiful and it's expensive now on the cheaper side we're not really downgrading all that much you've got a beautiful block of cheddar this is a medium cheddar it's lightly aged this is a lightly aged gouda or chowda so you've got your herbed havarti i've already used the cheese where it's texture and flavor goes a long way with how much it costs and cream cheese which i understand you're like what is that doing on a cheeseboard we're gonna we're gonna be doing something fancy to it so with that said let's move on to the next part oh and one last cheese which is uh blue cheese yeah and uh you know i know a lot of people get mad at me for this and you know i just you see yeti for me and i don't like it okay and i know i'll be like josh so uncultured you don't like this moldy nasty farty stinky poopy cheese fart look i like stinky cheese as much as the next guy this just tastes like a stiff sock okay not good now let's talk about meats for the expensive board you might choose something like a nice genoa salami calabresi some aged prosciutto which all start at quite the price as you can see they're amazing and i would pay that but if you want a cheaper counterpart i think we can still have all those nice salty cured flavors and that can be acquired with some decent sliced ham or some mortadella and you've got versatility both in texture and flavor between those two and you can also control that cost by ordering at the deli counter now although not the same a nice summer sausage could take the place of the salami as a potentially cheaper option since you'd buy the whole thing and slice it to your liking now for the pickley briny part sure we can do some olives which you could go ultra expensive with castle vetraranos which i marinate in an infused olive oil i'm sorry i'm trying not to flex so much it's just culinary so vast and beautiful and i just wanna i just wanna show you all you could also go much cheaper with bulk deli marinated olives now for a pickle while cornichons are lovely to eat and look at they do get a bit more expensive especially if they're the nice kind the cheaper option would be to make your own pickles for a simple pickled onion just snag yourself a nice plump red onion slice it thinly and beautifully like so place all that in a 1 quart mason jar or any large container that isn't metal separately in a medium sized pot add 2 cups or 480 milliliters of white vinegar 1 cup or 240 milliliters of water and 2 tablespoons or 25 grams of kosher salt bring that up to a boil over medium-high heat then as soon as it hits a boil immediately take it off the heat and pour it over your onions it should just about cover the onions i also like to use some plastic wrap to adhere to the surface of the liquid to keep everything submerged then just let that bad boy rest at room temp until completely cool let's turn a lovely little pink color then store that bad boy in the fridge or you know use it okay crunch is one of the most important elements to any cheese board in my opinion nuts are an obvious option those can sit with pistachios candied nuts or even some fancy olive oil crackers which get extremely pricey now a cheaper option for your nut you knew was gonna happen would be just simple toasted peanuts which in my opinion worked just fine on a cheeseboard although they're not my top choice now for an intensely delicious and cheaper option i'd also recommend getting yourself a baguette and slicing it into rounds place it on a baking sheet and toss it in the oven around 375 till nice and toasted pull those bad boys out get a clove of garlic slice it in half to expose a fresh cut edge then rub that end all over each slice of the bread you're perfuming it then get yourself a tomato slice that in half and do the exact same thing just like scrub it all over there you know and it sounds weird trust me you're essentially getting a really lovely garlicky tomato toast that's deep and rich in flavor but not destructive on the wall last but not least is the fruity and sweet components now this could be in the form of a beautiful chunk of honeycomb which although beautiful and delicious this thing cost me like 15 alone personally i think a nice jam ideally homemade will fit nicely with any cheese board and i do have a recipe here both on my youtube and my tik tok sorry for the plug now look i like expensive bougie fruits on my charcuterie board so these lovely little champagne grapes are great but they're also well expensive if you want to keep that price low i'd really recommend hitting up the apple section not like iphones but getting yourself some granny smith apples they do two things they add a little crunch and they add a beautiful tart sweetness to your board now the last thing we need to figure out is this cream cheese situation you could serve it as is but you know for one ugly for two i personally think a nice little habanero serrano gas streak would fit beautifully on there it's easier than you think simply combine one cup or 225 grams of granulated sugar and one cup or 240 milliliters of water in a small pot bring that to a boil over high heat and let that boil until it becomes a little bit syrupy should look like this about five minutes separately thinly slice two habanero chilies one serrano chili thinly slice a shallot over a mandolin once your mixture is ready let it cool for three minutes then pour your gastric over your vegetables hit it with some fresh cracked black pepper and let it sit until completely cool it's sour sweet aromatic and lightly spicy and it goes shockingly well with cheese or really anything now at this point i think we can go ahead and assemble our boards the goal is to arrange the things that go the best together closest to each other if that makes sense but of course it gets a little bit cramped so just let everything fall naturally into place honestly everything should go well together here keep wiggling and maneuvering until your little man is nice and ready to go you'll know when it's done the board will call out to you now serve this to your guest toss an ice cube in your chardonnay that's a joke for all the moms out there and let's see if this affordable board can hold up a candle we have mr expensive right here coming in at this price and then we have mr cheap coming in at this price it's a spicy meatball of a difference sure you could probably pick out which is the cheaper one because you can see a block of cream cheese on here but in terms of how voluminous it is and visually it's a big thumbs up times two these are normally a choose your own adventure the point is to mix and match sweet salty crunchy fatty get a little bit of everything cracker little piece of gouda it's pronounced oh and i'll get a little bit of this honey and then maybe you win pistachio nut it's almost exactly the same as when you're watching star wars and people are in the cockpit and then they go on hyper speed they're like because it hits like all of your senses in your dopamine receptors like on to the cheap one cream cheese we topped it with a chili gastrique that's pretty culinary full flexion right there that experience alone is wonderful we got our tomato toast little piece of mortadella on there do a little cheddar that's a good vibe the depth of flavor in this is insane it has a sense of nobility to it almost even if you are a fancy person this has a complex flavor this has complex textures if anybody cheaper i don't know what the hail is okay so if you don't want to spend like over a hundred dollars this is the way to go but you want to know what else is covered with cheese sticky stuff and all sorts of random things from across the supermarket b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made two charcuterie boards one that was very affordable for this price and one that was much more expensive for this price now they're both equally desirable in their own way like i could definitely see a moment where maybe i want the cheaper one over the more expensive one if i want something a little more relaxed and less like you know the point is is i didn't need a ton of money to make that beautiful thing happen you just need a little bit of patience a little bit of love and a good old noggin i hope this one is helpful for a lot of people i know a lot of college students out there want to have their shark coochie board and sit back and enjoy and here you go that's a very relevant meme right now so

You see where I’m going with this right? I give you the FIRST EVER Beef Stroganoff Soup Dumpling, made by...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, so we all know the classic dish beef stroganoff we know what it looks like we know what it tastes like but what if we completely reimagine it to something that we've never seen before [Music] okay so why remake beef stroganoff because the us navy as in the u.s navy the navy challenged me to completely remake it in a way that's never been seen before thank you to the us navy for sponsoring this video so i get to be a part of a series called sailor versus and the navy challenged me to put a fine dining spin on one of their staple dishes although beef stroganoff and soup dumplings kind of seem like two completely different things they can also be one in the same you think of a soup dumpling you bite into it and all the juice maybe it's a little fatty maybe it has some meat in it you're gonna get that experience but it's gonna taste exactly like beef stroganoff now with all that said let's see if we can do this i'm here with cs1 noah reed a culinary specialist in the navy how are you doing today i'm doing wonderful chef joshua good morning oh wow i was addressed as chef i'm like little baby i appreciate you coming on to a video called to do this we were supposed to be in person i feel like it would have been cooler if we were in person but i appreciate you coming through the first thing i actually wanted to ask you if you could tell me about your career as a culinary specialist in the navy absolutely we're cs's culinary specialists and we cook the entire fleet of the navy we have a mission to fulfill and we feed for the masses anywhere between 100 people to almost 5 000 depending on the ship we're on that's crazy i can't even imagine that okay so today we're making beef stroganoff i believe why is beef stroganoff so commonly used and where does it come from in what you guys do day to day it's just such a good hearty meal really savory flavors in it for cooking in the navy it's all about morale eating chow is like their only off time to kind of relax so we really want to make good food that makes them feel good i feel like in a way that's kind of what cooking is all about it's like you're sharing a little bit of love with everybody absolutely so we're talking about beef stroganoff i love the texture of it i love the way it looks but i also think we could take it a step further maybe a fattier meat like short rib and braise it and shred it and then instead of coating the noodles we take a noodle and we stuff a noodle and then we make essentially what would be a soup dumpling of beef stroganoff i'm not sure how you're gonna get all the flavors i don't see how that's going to work i have a couple tricks up my sleeve although my sleeves may not be that long i believe that this is going to come together before we get all fancy let's first get some context for the traditional beef stroganoff start off with one pound or 450 grams of a nice steak here i have a little piece of picanha which is essentially top sirloin which is then gonna get scored and sliced into three quarter inch chunks get yourself a large pan add in enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan set it over medium-high heat and once it's ripping hot add your steak in batches searing to get a nice little bit of color on it about two minutes per side try to be fast about it all right we don't want well done steak then remove it from the pan and add two and a half tablespoons or 35 grams of unsalted butter toss in two teaspoons or five grams of coarse ground black pepper follow that up with one diced sweet onion saute for about two to three minutes or until the onion begins to soften then add five cloves of thinly sliced garlic saute again just until that garlic is nice and fragrant toss in one tablespoon or 14 milliliters of cognac or whiskey you can light it and get a little flame if you want to have a little fancy time but whatever then toss in two and a half tablespoons or 30 mils of worcestershire sub stop work worcestershire sauce then nine ounces or 250 grams of cremini mushrooms that have been quartered let that sauteing cook for another two minutes or until the mushrooms begin to soften then add one and a half cups or 350 milliliters of beef broth once that's reduced and thickened a little bit add a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of heavy whipping cream then reduce again for another five minutes or so until you've got sort of a thicker emulsified sauce now separately we have half a cup or 120 milliliters of sour cream that has been mixed with two tablespoons or 28 grams of dijon mustard now we're gonna add that to the pan but don't just add it straight there all right unless you want a curdled mess so take a little bit of the hot liquid spoon it into your cold sour cream mixture mix that together and do that a few times just until the sour cream mixture is nice and hot then add it to your stroganoff liquid stir together adjust the salt and pepper levels to your taste finish it with a third cup or eight grams of fresh chopped parsley add some boiled egg noodles or whatever noodles you like i don't know all right what do you want am i the noodle whisperer stir together so that's the basic beef stroganoff now let's taste okay so we have a fork fork goes in so you can taste every component in this right let me let me finish chewing give me a second right off the bat you've got the mushrooms which are nice and roasty and a little bit caramelized there's worcestershire sauce in there that's got just a punchiness to it just punches you right in the mouth but in the best way possible the meat's nice and tender it's juicy it's still medium rare we didn't overcook it i'm curious cs1reed what do you think of this one i'll tell you what josh that looks amazing that's some awesome looking stroganoff appreciate it man i really appreciate it what to you flavor-wise really breaks down a proper stroganoff really awesome flavored beef because you could have an awesome sauce awesome noodles if the beef isn't prepared correctly or seasoned correctly now you have just old beef taste this is a man who understands you have to treat your meat properly don't take that in the wrong context whoever's watching this you always in any context should treat it right all right we got mr traditional out of the way now it's time for a new player get a one ounce package of dried mushrooms these are chanterelles and cover them with one cup or 240 milliliters of boiling water cover that with plastic wrap and let that soak for about five to ten minutes once the mushrooms are nice and hydrated wring out all the liquid from the mushrooms place them on a cutting board and chop them finely and place them in a separate bowl now instead of steak you're going to get yourself two nice big meaty short ribs season them generously with kosher salt get yourself a five quart dutch oven add in your short ribs and sear them for two to three minutes on every side until you get a beautiful brown crust now remove them from the pan dispose of any of that oil that's been sitting in the bottom now it's gonna be very similar to the original version on medium heat add your two and a half tablespoons of butter followed by your pepper let that toast sounding similar then add in your one diced onion season that with salt add in your five cloves of garlic but this time they're gonna be finely chopped followed by your chopped mushrooms that you've rehydrated then add your mushroom soaking liquid 2 cups or 480 milliliters of beef broth now bring that up to a boil then reduce to a light gentle simmer lower in your two seared short ribs place a lid on top then drop that voluptuous beauty into an oven set to 325 degrees fahrenheit for two and a half to three hours once that's done remove it from the oven take out your short ribs get two forks remove their bones and then shred the meat as finely as you possibly can i mean look at that that looks awesome it's fatty it's tender it's full of flavor and it's moist once your braising liquid is nice and reduced toss in two tablespoons or 28 grams of a whole grain dijon mustard followed by a quarter cup of 60 milliliters of heavy whipping cream bring that back up to a simmer you're then going to sprinkle in one tablespoon or 14 grams of unflavored gelatin stir that in so it's nice and evenly distributed then add your sour cream to the mixture add back your shredded meat along with your third a cup and eight grams of fresh chopped parsley stir that all together season a taste with salt and pepper and that's gonna be our soup dumpling filling then just pour that into a shallow third pan or eight by eight baking pan cover it with plastic wrap you know let the plastic wrap suck shin on to there and place it in the refrigerator overnight once your filling is ready it's time to make your soup dumpling dough first wrassle yourself a medium sized bowl to that you're going to add two and three quarters of a cup or 400 grams of all-purpose flour add in three quarters of a cup 180 milliliters of hot water begin kneading that if you have asbestos hands like me now dump it out and knead by hand for about eight minutes or until get a nice smooth and elastic dough wrap it nicely in plastic wrap give it a face with some personality and some love and then toss it to the side and forget about it for 30 minutes take your dough divide it into four even pieces and each piece pat it down into a nice little oval shape then flowering when needed and then begin running it through a pasta roller on setting number one slowly working your way up to two then to three and then finally all the way up to five until you get a nice thin sheet that you can at least see your hand through then take a three and a half inch biscuit cutter and cut them into rounds see look at that it looks beautiful now once you've got rounds for all of your dumpling dough get your pan that you've solidified your stroganoff invert your pan let your gelatinized stroganoff fall out look at that beautiful then cut it into half inch little cubes get them as even as you can i mean doesn't have to be perfect but you know even is always better now to shape the dumpling it's very simple grab a piece of dough add in anywhere between two to three pieces of your stroganoff fold it like a taco pinch the center so you sort of got this like glued top taco then take each side bring them together to the center and then pinch them to that one center point on both sides so now you have an open sort of star then just close those edges all together so everything is completely and totally sealed and that is your dumpling shape now just rinse and repeat with all of your dumplings now from here all you need is a shallow pot of water bring it up to a simmer place the steamer basket on it add some cabbage leaves just so it doesn't stick then add in your dumplings with at least one inch of space in between all of them add on your lid and let them steam for anywhere between 7 to 12 minutes or until they're completely cooked open your seamer basket place them on a plate and enjoy a soup dumpling that's filled with hot rich and creamy beef stroganoff you don't need to add anything to this now let's prove why okay so the adaptation is a soup dumpling this is a new format of both soup dumplings and beef stroganoff marrying and creating two completely separate items in one let's take a bite textures right on spot so cs1 read i'm very curious what do you think of these we've got them all wrapped up everything's consolidated within this beautiful little package that is filled with hot and juicy beef stroganoff that is extremely unique that is some fine dining cooking right there but we need to have a challenge to see if you can hold up cooking for the masses how many people are we talking here probably push two or three hundred cs one reed i very very much appreciate you showing up and just watching me cook all day that's uh that's a big task to ask oh we'll uh rhyme there so i appreciate it and uh i will see you in that challenge but do you want to know what else you can turn into the form of a soup dumpling b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made soup dumplings that are well beef stroganoff and i think it worked so thank you again to the u.s navy for sponsoring this video and thank you to cs1 read for your thoughts helping us out talking to us about this keep watching for more exciting

gonna be the main event [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today we're making the arby's beef and cheddar welcome back to but better it's been a while since i've welcomed you back so i just wanna welcome you back i wanna welcome you back you know papa love you and he miss you and think about you every day go to sleep i think about you wake up i think about you what i've been really thinking about is this beefy sandwich long story short it's a beef sandwich it's comprised of an onion bun thinly sliced roast beef and a cheese sauce and sometimes zesty rant or what is it called it's called like red ranch whatever with all its head let's make this shall we there it is look it's a bit you know for the longest time i didn't know what the hell that shape was until i realized it was a hat or is it a boot what is that it's just a big hat where does beef sandwiches correlate with a big hat thank you for children rv for a moment please hey excuse me yep you said something i'm sorry about the way can we do a beef and cheddar sandwich thank you so much this is the most emotionally draining toxic experience in a drive-through i'm not trying to like play up how bad it is we pull up we wait 15 minutes they're like done i feel bad for the people in the restaurant i have heart for people that work in restaurants i know what they go through but then i was annoyed and then that guy whips his truck around his kid is crying so he obviously took it out on his kid and then he like pulls up and he's like the manager didn't even do anything let's go home and eat the sandwich okay so we have the bag it's our commitment to serve refresh and delight every guest they have a truly delicious experience when have you ever gone into an arby's and you're like god this was an experience if your food or experience did not dela you'd be happy to make your bread well arby's i hope you can make it right the classic beef and cheddar this is flatter than i imagined it you want to eat that come on no what is that i just smell bread i'm not saying it's bad it's just not good the meat itself tastes nice because it's salted and i'm pretty sure there's a lot of msg involved but you can you can go so much better the cheese sauce that's just not cheese and then the bun gum gummy i know vikram likes that word gummy maybe it's better with the rv sauce okay it helps um mask the lackluster flavor that this is long story short look is this the worst sandwich that i've had no but it is much lesser than what it could be so let's make it right all right there are many layers to this sandwich and it deserves the justice of making each puzzle piece with excellence first up let's talk about those onion buns now before we even make our buns let's get two medium sized sweet onions cut their tops off slice them in half then give them a good old medium dice like so then all you need to do is caramelize them in a pan which you'll do by melting a couple tablespoons of butter over medium heat in a medium saucepan add in your onions season it with salt and a small pinch of sugar stir together then add a lid and cook those while stirring intermittently until they're nice and caramelized about 45 minutes from there you'll need one and a quarter cup or 295 grams of water at around 100 degrees fahrenheit or 37 degrees celsius mix in one tablespoon or 12 grams of instant yeast set that to the side then in the bowl of a stand mixer combine three and three quarters of a cup or 612 grams of bread flour and two teaspoons or 14 grams of fine sea salt mix it together till combined then place it on your stand mixer and begin mixing with the dough spiral thingy on low speed then add all of your yeast water plus two whole eggs which are well ideally room temp then let that mix for five minutes or until nicely incorporated and you've got a smooth little mini then one tablespoon at a time add three tablespoons or 42 grams of unsalted softened butter continue to mix on medium-low speed until thoroughly combined smooth and beautiful now you can add your cooled caramelized onions if you put them in while they're hot then well i'm gonna have to i don't know like give you a spanking or something just don't do it make sure they're cool anyway once it's nice and incorporated place in a greased bowl cover it with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temp for one hour or till chubby like this as usual you know you've given it life and then you're just gonna punch it back down then divide into eight even pieces which should be around 110 to 130 grams each if you want to be you know real precise like me then take a piece of dough fold it together and shape them into balls the same way that we literally do in all of my videos with buns you know we should all be accustomed by now place this on a baking sheet one with parchment paper cover it with another sheet and proof for 25 minutes at room temperature then give each bun a nice brushing with egg wash optionally top them with everything bagel seasoning then toss them in an oven set to 375 fahrenheit for 15 to 18 minutes or till beautifully golden brown like this then just finish them by brushing them with melted butter and those are some real buns now let's see who really has the meats it's uh it's me i have the meats daddy's meat here we have a gorgeous eight pound prime rib roast to prep this chunky filler you're gonna need half a cup or 50 grams of finely ground high quality coffee mix that together with three tablespoons or 28 grams of kosher salt and a generous amount of fresh ground black pepper and i mean generous now snag your roast rub it down generously with your seasoning you'll have plenty left over so just you know save it and use it later you're welcome now from here you can either let it rest at room temp for about one and a half hours with the seasoning or place it in the fridge overnight before cooking now to cook this bad boy line a roasting pan with tons of fresh rosemary some halved shallots and any other aromatics you'd like to add i applied some coriander seeds and various other things to perfume the beef now finally place your beef onto the aromatic garden of eden you just laid toss it into an oven set to 450 fahrenheit or 2 30 celsius for 15 minutes then immediately drop the temperature to 325 fahrenheit or 162 celsius and roast for 11 minutes per pound around one and a half hours for this one or until the internal temperature reaches 120 fahrenheit or 48 degrees celsius then let it rest for at least 20 minutes minimum to keep it extra moist now while that beef is resting you're gonna make your arby's sauce simply combine one cup or 311 grams of ketchup we got a lacto fermented ketchup you could use just go watch it 3 tablespoons or 45 grams of hot sauce 1 tablespoon or 16 grams of brown sugar 2 teaspoons or 8 grams of garlic powder 1 tablespoon or 12 grams of worcestershire sauce sauce 1.5 tablespoons or 19 grams of water whisk all that together then place in the stove bring to a simmer over medium heat and let that reduce for about five minutes and take it off the heat and well that's it you know it tastes surprisingly similar to arby's sauce but with flavor now one last thing cheese sauce get a small sauce pot heat two tablespoons or 28 grams of unsalted butter over medium heat till completely melted then add two tablespoons or 23 grams of all-purpose flour whisk together and cook for about 30 seconds then slowly whisk in one cup or 240 milliliters of whole milk keep heating and whisking until that thickens then add one and a half cups or 135 grams of shredded cheddar cheese turn off the heat keep whisking until completely melted and velvety smooth season that bad boy to taste with salt and pepper and we're ready to assemble so obviously get yourself a bun you cut it in half and toast it beautifully you guys know how important good toasted bread is to me okay don't make papa cry then slice your beef as thinly as you can the thinner you can go the better but you know it does get more difficult the more you slice now on the bottom of your toasted bun apply a generous layer of your rb sauce gently layer your beef onto your bun almost sort of folding it on top of itself for that iconic look add a generous spoonful or two of your cheese sauce and crown your king for what i believe to be one of the most beautiful beef sandwiches i think i've ever made now it's time to put that beauty to the test i mean first off we folded our meat we'll let us be for ourselves for it we'll let it speak for itself this is one of those sandwiches you know we're like the first bite the meat is just so tender and juicy and meaty like it should be it's not like turkey breast that's beef flavored you take a bite and you're just floating away and i don't even know just it's just so juicy and good not only do we have the folds in our meat and we folded our bees oh man i mean i have my verdict but i think we're gonna need somebody to come in and taste testing you they're so cute thank you oh man for the man baby challenge we'll be dodging what we're dodging stuff this time vikram doesn't know what it is great babe the challenge that we're gonna be doing then get out i don't know why we did that your trophy yay so i'm gonna give you a sandwich and you're going to eat the sandwich okay sandwich number one yeah that's all you gotta do i'm gonna give you the second sandwich and then you good job he found his mouth without a doubt josh this one's yours this one's better yeah you know this one the first one tastes tastes like school lunch i was like where am i right now and it felt like the sixth grade all over again that was very good we win yet again right now the thing is at the end of the day the deliciousness factor is up here but then they make you sleepy either way one way or another we have the meats okay if there's anyone that has the meats it is us you got folded but better we win again but do you want to know what else is beefy moist and covered with cheese oh god [Music] all b-roll guys and that is it so we made arby's beef and cheddar sandwich this is the best rendition that i think that there could possibly be it is a beautiful homemade baked sort of brioche style caramelized onion everything bagel seasoning you have slow roasted prime rib on the inside come on cheese sauce i decided not to go with the red ranch and decided to go with a sort of arby's sauce because i don't fully understand or respect or i just don't like the idea of red ranch i'm sorry i'm just not going to do that right now if there's an overwhelming response for it then we'll do it but for the time being we're going to do our sauce that doesn't mean we're done with arby's long story short i think we did a beautiful job here so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time

aspect this is one of those things okay so today we're making mac and cheese but not just any sort of like mac and cheese and stir we're making it three ways one that's macaroni in the pot shout out to megan stallion and uh cardi b the second being an oven version and then the third being a healthy version which brings me to my next point this video is sponsored by thrive market you know we got

lifestyle so anyway with all that said let's make this shall we alrighty tidy so let's make our first mac and chee of the day make sure to season your water very generously with salt the italians will be angry if you don't and well so will i first start by boiling half a pound of macaroni or pasta of choice now cook that bad boy just until al dente drain it and hold it on the side to make this sauce simply melt 2 tablespoons or 28 grams of unsalted butter over medium heat then add 2 tablespoons or 18 grams of all-purpose flour mix that together and let that cook for about 45 seconds now from there you're gonna slowly add one cup or 240 milliliters of whole milk keep whisking over medium heat until that thickens nicely like so now shut the heat off and add 2 cups or 180 grams of grated cheese this is half raclette and half cheddar you know a little bit classy whisk that all together until completely melted and smooth like this i mean come on it's just a velvet gorgeousness i mean come on it looks like velvet i guess that's where the term velveeta comes from because it's like velvety but you know that mashup of words didn't work so well anyway it's velvety liquid smooth then finish it off by whisking in three and a half tablespoons or 55 grams of creme fresh for a little bit of a chef's kiss season that to taste with salt and stir your macaroni back in for symphony both in flavor and sound now that's macaroni in the pot now for the next one we're going to make a family-style oven version for the breadcrumb topping mix together three quarters of a cup or 58 grams of panko breadcrumbs why did i say that like the foot lettuce guy one tablespoon or nine grams of zatar two teaspoons or three grams of fresh chopped thyme mix all that together till combined then mix in 4 tablespoons or 56 grams of melted unsalted butter you know feel free to add some flaky salt or black pepper if you have that now for the pasta portion it's the same procedure as before but with different proportions first mix together three cups or 250 grams of cheddar and three cups or 250 grams of gruyere then in a large pot boil one pound of macaroni this time using a conchigli shape that's what i like boil just before it's al dente and slightly underdone drain it again then in the empty pot add a third cup or 73 grams of unsalted butter melt over medium heat sounding familiar whisk in a third cup or 50 grams of all-purpose flour cook for 45 seconds then this time add in three cups or 720 milliliters of whole milk whisk that till it begins to thicken then add 4 cups of that cheese mix that you made earlier whisk until completely smooth add your pasta back in mix oh whoa that doesn't usually usually happen um then from there you're gonna pour half of that into a four to five quart baking dish sprinkle on the remaining cheese mixture then pour the other half on top top that off with all of your bread crumb topping and place it in an oven that's been set to 350 degrees fahrenheit or 175 degrees celsius for 25 to 30 minutes or until bubbly and the topping is lightly golden like so now let's taste test these two first up we have the regular mac and cheese this is a simple one right we're talking a true mornay sauce it's a root it's milk it's cheese and you put macaroni that is true simple macaroni in the pot this is for cardi b and megan the stallion thank you so much so this has like that classic sort of like buffet style macaroni and cheese you go to a hotel and you're like oh my gosh i can't wait to go on the slip and slide but it ends up not being that fun but you have this macaroni awaiting in a big hotel pan and all the people are yelling and screaming anyway so second oh this is a really simple common oven mac and cheese you put panko bread crumbs on top we've got a mornay sauce but you see you flavor the panko bread crumbs and it permeates through the whole dish this one is ultra ultra cheesy like oh yeah that's the one this is the one it's like a big mouth singing to me like this is way better flavored texturally you get more volume you can cook a lot all at once this is all you get for this recipe granted you could scale it up but a little extra time anyway the point is you have two easy mac and cheese recipes you can either go the one step version or you can go the two-step version but if you just take that extra effort i promise you it will be worth it okay last but not least is the healthier low calorie mac and cheese from our homies at thrive market same as before you're going to go ahead and boil yourself one pound of nice shell pasta here i've got some brown rice pasta low gi gang you heard boil that according to the directions separately we're gonna make a low calorie cheese sauce which i didn't think was possible until i figured this one out so get yourself a head of cauliflower remove the florets place those bulbous veggie clouds into a pot filled with water bring to a boil and boil those puppies until they're well about as soft as they can get around 8 to 10 minutes i want them to be mushy go ahead and fish those brothers out of the water pop them into a blender start off with about a cup of your water that used to boil begin blending adding additional water if needed and once that's nice and smooth and vortexing add in 1 cup or 90 grams of grated cheddar 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of nutritional yeast 2 teaspoons or 6 grams of turmeric powder and salt and pepper to taste i'm using truffle salt because you know well why not blend till beautifully incorporated and taste salty to your liking now just mix that together with your pasta i'm always amazed by this although it's tasty you don't need a ton of cream and cheese to make something taste great it's all about good technique now let us compare our flavors right so the sun went away bummer so the color might look a little weird we've got essentially it's not vegan but i think it's vegetarian you use a vegetarian chia nonetheless this is a healthier version of a mac and cheese it's low calorie so you can eat a bunch of it if you're watching your macros and those are my guns low calorie here you go you know you watch me eat all these different things and it's about making things as great as possible but it's almost like people think i don't ever eat healthy food and two things food can be perfectly low calorie or healthy or whatever and still be perfectly delicious it just takes a little bit of finesse now look i'm not gonna lie is the texture of this exactly the same as mac and cheese of course not but the flavor itself is amazing very very very nice that truffle salt really helps and the cheese that nutritional yeast really helps lift the cheese flavor if you're on a diet and you're craving mac and cheese and you have a bite of this you may never go back do you want to know what else is saucy and full of cheese [Music] b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made mac and cheese honestly all of these options were fantastic i've always been more sort of a macaroni in the pot guy cardi b megan how are you doing but the oven version kind of surprised me considering i don't make it that often and it's really a solution to a lot of problems when making mac and cheese you can make more it's easier to serve and all those things so and it's a different eating experience and then the third one of course especially surprised me being a healthy version it's like healthy mac and cheese come on it's not supposed to be low calorie but it's a great alternative it still has that rich anxious sort of cheesy quality to it and also it had the nice macaroni texture it really wasn't that different at all um you know and i think that if you're trying to drop your calories you're trying to eat something healthier that's a great way to go thank you to our friends at thrive market for sponsoring this video don't forget to head to the link in the description to get yourself a membership

Sure homemade pizza will always be cheaper, but we really went barebones while preserving and maximizing flavor and it's ""easy to make"" factor. So basically......",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, so tell me this you got two options large pizza for 20 or an even larger pizza for six dollars that should be enough info for you [Music] okay so we'll come back to butt cheaper where we take commonly expensive foods like pizza and make them as cheap as we possibly can the average cost of pizza varies widely but on average most large pizzas are going to start at minimum 13 14 and if you're at a nice pizza place 20 30 i wouldn't be surprised wouldn't be surprised which is ludicrous to me and we could do way better than that 50 cents per slice thick i'm talking like one slices of meal pizza this is essentially sicilian style so i've mentioned this a few times at the end of my other videos and i really want to mention it here i'm currently designing a new apron with one of the largest most famous powerful design companies in the world for all the home cooks and even for people who do other jobs like it doesn't even have to cook the point is to provide value and we're making something really really special that's never been seen before i just wanted to put that out there it's a secret for now but i wanted you to know so with all that said let's make this shall we so obviously in order to begin we're going to need a dough admittedly this dough is similar to the focaccia but with slight yet important tweaks in the bowl of a stand mixer add 900 grams of bread flour and a hundred grams of whole wheat flour and before anyone asks yes you can do this by hand calm down i know it's about cheaper like it's gonna be fine mix it together until thoroughly combined separately get a quart container or a bowl and add eight grams of instant yeast and dissolve with 780 grams of water that's around 95 to 100 degrees fahrenheit or 37 degrees celsius whisk all that together and let that sit for a minute or two now with your stand mixer on low speed add that yeasty watery little man to your flour then let that mix for 10 minutes you may need to scrape down the sides to get any unhydrated flour mixed in make sure that there's no you know clots of random dry flour at the bottom after those 10 minutes are up add 20 grams of fine sea salt let that mix together and incorporate for 10 more minutes then finally add 20 grams of extra virgin olive oil increase this medium speedium increase the speed to medium low and let that mix for five more minutes or till completely incorporated now like usual we'll perform a light set of slap and folds by dumping it on your counter picking it up and slapping it down then folding it over itself like so repeatedly until it's smooth now look i know a lot of people might find this a little difficult at first it will feel messy but it will come together the more you do this and it shouldn't stick as badly anyway transfer that to a container that's been greased with olive oil this container has about five quarts of space in it cover it with a lid that's also been greased and set it in the fridge for anywhere between one and three days so we have the dough wait a minute wait your voice over and now it's coming out of your mouth and we're inner cutting this can be left at room temperature for uh 24 hours overnight right or you can go in the fridge just like the facade for up to 72 hours okay now once your long-awaited pizza day has arrived snag yourself a baking sheet hit it generously with some spray oil and a nice drizzle of olive oil dump your dough out onto your sheet gently stretch it as far as it will allow to the edges it'll naturally retract a little that's okay then cover your sheet with another baking sheet wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for one and a half to two hours or until it reaches the edges of the pan and it's nice and plump like this now while your yeasty boys are producing voluptuous pockets of air let's make our sauce heat a medium-sized sauce pot over a medium heat medium and medium really cute then add one tablespoon of olive oil i put a little more than that in here but for the sake of price you can get by with one tablespoon once that's hot add eight cloves of rough chopped garlic and one teaspoon or three grams of red pepper flakes stir that together and let that cook just until fragrant then add a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes stir that together again and bring to a light simmer then let that cook in reduce for about six to eight minutes stirring occasionally then once that's done season it to taste with salt and pepper and maybe a little pinch of sugar to help curb the acidity of the sauce then let that cool completely before adding to your pizza okay so it's pizza party time grab your sheet tray of dough add on a nice generous layer of sauce across the surface then sprinkle on two cups of grated mozzarella cheese i'd recommend braiding your own keep the price down then add on an extremely calculated layer of pepperoni and i say calculated because for some reason i i just it has to be in the perfect spot otherwise i won't be happy but put it on how you like now once your pizza is studded with me pop that bad boy into your oven that's been preheated to its max around 500 to 550 degrees fahrenheit or 260 degrees celsius then let that bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the crust is a beautiful dark brown and the cheese is melting and bubbling like this now we're looking at essentially a gigantic sicilian pizza for about six dollars give or take now let's see if the taste can surpass its price yay i got the last piece haha it's movie magic you're gay kids i'll tell you when you're older this is essentially a sicilian pizza this pizza grand total grand total cost six dollars bro 50 cents per pizza basically per slice not per pizza okay we got a four four inches this one's four inches by four inches we had some that were like six inches so we got like basically personal this is like a personal pizza right this is a big piece of pizza symphony a symphony ah that's very good you've got this like super super super anxious and rich chewy bread it's soft but it's crispy on the outside the olive oil it's rich and then the cheese hits you it's beautifully caramelized that little pepperonis on there optional of course depends on how cheap you want to go and then the sauce is like a little spicy it's salty a little bit of sweetness from the tomato why did i bite it like this who does that so if you have some or most of the ingredients this pizza is going to cost you max six dollars 50 cents per slice or 16 if you literally have to go buy every single thing but nonetheless you'll have those ingredients left over price point flavor everything put together this isn't just pizza but cheaper is this a butt better you want to know what else is plump and oozing with cheese all right b-roll and that is it so we made basically a sicilian pizza it's very very similar to my focaccia recipe not terribly different other than i changed some proportions and timing and all that to make the crust exactly how i like it changed a couple things about the dough a little bit about the timing and you've got a beautiful gigantic sheet pan pizza for like as little as six dollars upwards of 16 if you have literally none of the ingredients and you have to buy everything i just want to mention for those of you who are watching you know when i say it's if you have to buy everything you also have to remember that if you're buying every single ingredient like the flour and garlic and this and all these whole ingredients you have to remember that even after you're done making the pizza you still have those ingredients to use again elsewhere so it's hard to actually incorporate those prices because it's like well you're really only using a portion of it it's not like you're using the whole bag i'm off my soapbox let me step down get a man but anyway with all that said i hope you enjoyed this one this should be a helpful one this is such an easy pizza to make everyone can make this anyone can participate and it's it's so enjoyable to eat and you can make this over and over and you can feed a lot of people with just two sheet pans of pizza so anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] you

American Style),https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GLdl71cZXmY/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLCRzaMsEcXAJWyU4kXtO9e4PjjdtA,GLdl71cZXmY,"7 minutes, 33 seconds","Homemade pancakes are truly a beautiful thing in the morning. Now the only issue is finding a recipe you want to stick to. The Japanese Souffle pancake, or the traditional American ""flapjack""....",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, you know there's more pancake varieties than just about anything on the planet so i thought let's just condense this down to the two very best in the breakfast category [Music] so like i said before we're gonna talk about two of the best pancakes that being the all-american pancake that we all know and love fluffy get them piled and stacked as high as the eye can see and then the fluffy souffle japanese pancakes that we've all seen on the internet they've taken the internet by storm and i thought you know what let's make this very simple we're gonna make both of them we're gonna make the fluffiest easiest version of the all-american and then we're gonna make a classic japanese souffle one then we're gonna decide not only which is better but if it's even worth it to make the souffle so with all that said let's do this shall we so aside from the fact that we're gonna be ignoring crepes in this video please do yourself a favor and buy the best maple syrup that money can buy or well as far as your dollar can stretch that is now if you want to take it a step further you could smoke your maple syrup and no i'm not talking about the kind that would send you to the hospital i'm talking pour your maple syrup into a bowl cover it with plastic wrap and then attach a smoke gun this is the breville version i'll have a link in the description no this is not sponsored i just happen to use it i filled this one up with hickory smoke pulled its dangly thing out and bing bang boom you have the sweet nectar of the tree gods that also taste like a campfire so for our first pancake we'll make a traditional all-american flapjack look this is really easy in a small bowl whisk together one egg and one and a half cups or 386 grams of whole milk once those are thoroughly combined in a separate bowl add in two cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour a quarter cup or 62 grams of granulated sugar one teaspoon or four grams of fine sea salt a quarter teaspoon or one gram of baking soda and one tablespoon or 12 grams of baking powder give that some whiskey business by the way i still don't know why you guys get so stressed if i don't say whiskey business i mean it's i don't know anyway once that's combined mix your flour mix with the milky egg stuff and as you're mixing that together whisk in two tablespoons or 21 grams of melted unsalted butter and continue whisking until everything is combined and smooth it's okay if there's a couple lumps here and there now let that batter rest for about five minutes then preheat yourself a non-stick skillet over medium heat hit it with some spray oil and or a couple tablespoons of unsalted butter and once that pan is nice and hot spoon in quarter cup dollops of your batter i would say like three to four are good for a ten inch skillet and cook for two to three minutes or until golden brown on the bottom i usually go by firmness rather than bubbles showing up at the top of my pancake oftentimes that tends to lead to you know overcooking but i'll judge your dry ass pancakes respectfully now flip your pancakes and cook an additional one to three minutes or till beautiful golden brown and bouncy but not overly firm place those lovelies on the side and repeat with the rest of your batter and would you look at that those look like some flippin pancakes or flapjacks or whatever you want to call them doesn't matter to me now obviously you'll top that with butter drizzle it with some maple syrup or smoked maple syrup if you're truly a culinary hypebeast like me and enjoy but before we do that let's talk about our competitor here the japanese pancake these are really easy to mess up so please pay extra special attention here papa's watching start off with two whole eggs crack those bad boys and separate them out into two medium bowls one for the yolks and one with the whites to the two yolks you're gonna add one tablespoon or 14 grams of whole milk one teaspoon or three grams of vanilla extract whisk all that together until completely smooth then you'll sift in a quarter cup or 30 grams of cake flour three quarters of a teaspoon or three grams of baking powder and half a teaspoon or one gram of fine sea salt make sure to sift that out nicely and whisk all that together until thoroughly combined and place it aside separately begin beating your egg whites with electric beaters and once they reach a soft peak begin slowly adding two and a half tablespoons or 35 grams of granulated sugar a little bit at a time until all of it is added keep on whipping until you get nice stiff peaks be careful not to overbeat this you want to be nice and glossy like this not a separated chunky mess now fold in a quarter of your meringue into the yolk mixture till thoroughly incorporated then the next fourth and fold again till uh incorporated and repeat two more times until all of your meringue is added and you have a lovely fluffy mixture like this don't you beat out that air okay that sounds weird carefully transfer that mixture to a piping bag with a round tip attachment or just a plastic bag with the corner cut out and heat yourself a non-stick medium skillet over low heat until nice and hot spray that with some cooking oil and wipe off the excess now pipe two evenly sized mounds only using half of your mixture to do so pipe those evenly otherwise they'll cave in and i'll have to come in and yell at you for a little bit some people like that so i don't know maybe do it on purpose splash in a spoonful of water in the blank areas of the pan immediately cover with a lid and let that steam and cook for five minutes then lift the lid and you'll notice it might have spread a little that's okay pipe another large mound that is evenly shaped onto both of your pancakes add another spoonful of water cover and cook for an additional three to four minutes take the lid off and now your moment of truth you're gonna flip these but wait the trick to flipping this is not a traditional one you have to sort of coax it into rolling over onto the other side like this you have delicate bb souffles here keep daddy's fingies nice and relaxed when you do this now add another spoonful of water cover with the lid and cook for three to four more minutes you may have to just time a little bit overcooking your undercooking will mean a totally sunken souffle and that's depressing now finally take your pancakes out of your pan plop them onto a plate but gently top with whipped cream some nice butter and a generous dusting of powdered sugar and screw it maybe some more smoked maple syrup too for the flex let's taste test and see who the real winner is okay so we have two pancakes that are relatively well simple none of that sort of like nutella stuffed cookie butter pounded their pancakes for a normal pancake you just throw together put in the pan these are in my opinion the perfect pancake the souffle pancakes after all that work really better come through they're pretty good i know i'm gonna catch flack for this one but these souffle pancakes are overrated they're good and they have like a nice airiness they almost like melt in your mouth which is really cool but not worth the effort so at the end of the day this is going to be the only route that you want to go unless you want to spend time trying a new fun project you want to have it then you might as well just make some regular pancakes and smoke your maple syrup do you want to know what else is plump fluffy and covered in sticky stuff b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made japanese pancakes and we made regular all-american flapjack pancakes whatever you want to call them at the end of the day i love how simplistic and easy a pancake is to me it's something that should be whisked together tossed in a pan cooked flipped and eaten right then on the spot while it's still hot the japanese pancake isn't really that hard but the thing is timing that cook right everybody's stove top is so different it took me five tries to get the pancake to stay tall and i realized that it has a lot to do with how you cook it if you overcook it it's gonna fall down if you undercook it it's gonna fall down you have to cook it perfectly in the world of like making breakfast for your friends and family it's just not realistic it's very cool and they're beautiful and they're fluffy but let's just stick with a beautiful perfect pancake recipe that i have delivered to you here with all that said papa love you and if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time my voice cracked alright [Music] you

It's more of like an assembly than anything else. Sort of like a less stressful...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, so there's a number of things that we go out and order and everything to make and you might think well i don't even know if i can make that at home well the answer with this is you can it's easier than you think and it might just be one of the greatest things that you ever make [Music] okay so we're making one of my favorite things of all time fresh spring rolls not the fried kind now obviously we know the crunchy ones with vegetables and maybe a little bit of meat whatever these are the ones that are translucent you can see a little bit of the shrimp peeking through or sometimes there's pork or whatever and then there's rice noodles it's crunchy it's sweet it's a little salty there's just everything you want and obviously you can't forget the peanut sauce but another thing you can't forget is today's sponsor which is spam yes spam one of the most chef revered canned products of all time you might be thinking josh well wait you're sponsored by spam why uh well first off this goes way back for me i'm talking like down to learning about cooking learning about chefs and what they do and working with chefs many of my chef friends love this ingredient because it is so versatile you can see it you could base it you could do so much with it and here they are knock that off the bucket list we're sponsored by spam so really we have two recipes here we have a traditional one and then we have a little surprise from our friends at spam so with all that said let's make this shall we now the actual making and rolling of spring rolls doesn't really require much effort or time but we first have to make all the components first let's talk rice vermicelli noodles you can get these at asian markets or maybe if your local grocer is a homie you might be able to get it there too you'll need about five to six ounces of these prepare them according to the package directions these just say to boil for about six minutes now once they're done plunge them in an ice water bath until completely cold this feels nice then rinse them thoroughly that's it now let's make the peanut sauce that's peanut sauce yanaiste so you just start with half a cup or 148 grams of hoisin sauce a quarter cup or 60 grams of smooth peanut butter 1 tablespoon or 15 grams of sambal or any sort of spicy you like 2 tablespoons or 28 grams of rice vinegar this is a fancy yuzu rice vinegar 2 cloves of grated garlic and finally thin it out with a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of warm water whisk that together and then drink the entire thing just kidding that would probably not probably wouldn't feel great it's pretty intense uh next up is gonna be fried crispy shallots and they're very easy just get yourself about six to eight shallots cut their tops off and peel them but leaving them whole then i would really recommend using a mandolin over a knife and slice them a little thinner than a quarter of an inch once you have all your slices get a deep pan like a cast iron skillet and fill it up with at least one and a half inches of oil add your shallot in yes while it's cold then place it over medium high heat and while that's coming up you're going to constantly stir them with a pair of chopsticks you'll notice that they start to bubble and then fry and just keep stirring and frying you'll know they're almost done once they begin to stop bubbling so much and they start to color please understand these will color very fast and burn very quickly if you don't pay attention once the bubbling begins to subside and they're almost to a nice golden brown immediately remove them and drain them on a paper towel you pull them a little bit before because they will continue to brown after pulled out of the oil oh my gosh it's time for papa learning corner you know the reason why that matters is it's called heat carryover that's because heat continues to stay after you remove it from a hot area it's not like it just instantly goes away let this cool completely and you have crunchy shallots now these won't be used in the traditional shrimp one but the way that i like to plate up the peanut sauce is i like to take a small handful of toasted peanuts and a small handful of your crispy shallots place them in a bag and beat them lovingly with a mallet or a pot until you get a nice little crumble and i like to sprinkle that on top of my peanut sauce when serving but we're getting ahead of ourselves here okay so we have the majority of our components let's start with a traditional shrimp spring roll fill a medium sized pot with water place it on your stove and bring it to a boil optionally you can add aromatics like shallot or ginger like i did here once it comes to a boil drop in one pound of peeled and deveined shrimp cover with the lid and turn the heat off and let them poach for three to four minutes then remove them and immediately drop them into an ice water bath to cool and that's it you have beautifully poached shrimp now to assemble our shrimp spring roll first get a medium-sized bowl add in one to two julienne carrots i used a julienne peeler by the way for this one ew josh is cheating when yeah well you know what it was faster all right one to two thai chilies that have been thinly sliced a quarter cup or five grams of torn mint a quarter cup or five grams of torn cilantro and a quarter cup or six grams of torn thai basil hit that with the zest of one lime and toss together to combine now we're ready to assemble get some round rice paper sheets these are also available at asian markets also have a link in the description fill a large bowl with enough warm water to submerge it in and well submerge one rice paper sheet for about two to three seconds or until it becomes a little bit malleable pull it out place it on a cutting board add a few leaves of lettuce of your choice these are little baby boston leaves followed by your vermicelli noodles i mean look at those dangly boys some of your carrot herb salad followed by more lettuce and of course your poached shrimp which by the way have been sliced in half like so arrange your shrimp as you like to make a nice little design then fold the right side over then the left side over and well roll it all the way up it's kind of like a rice paper burrito in a way place it to the side and then repeat with the rest of your shrimp ones and you have a beautiful shrimp spring roll one of my favorite things about spring rolls you can do this this is the true original glizzy there was no other glizzy until this homemade spring rolls extremely easy but without further ado a little dunkaroo oh my [ __ ] fell out go back in here funny man stop looking at me vikram maybe it's because it has everything that i want in it but to me this is the perfect spring roll traditional it's relaxed it's great for when it's hot outside but you can also eat this during the winter and be perfectly happy all the flavors match beautifully one thing that i would note is when you make it yourself i mean you are essentially probably going to make the best spring roll you've ever had because you're putting everything that you want in it now tradition is great but what if we made a little bit of a upgraded version if you will this one's for the chefs get yourself one spam classic can remove your spam and cut it into quarter inch slices like so then cut those slices in half to get some nice little rectangles get yourself a medium sized pan heat it over medium high heat with enough oil to coat the bottom and once that's ripping hot add your spam in batches to avoid overcrowding and sear for about two minutes or till beautifully seared and crispy give it a flip and sear for an additional two minutes now another thing you can do is brush it with some hoisin sauce after you flipped it and brulee it with a kitchen torch to get a little bit of a glaze optional but uh recommended in a small bowl add 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of granulated sugar and whisk in 1 tablespoon or 15 milliliters of hot water whisk that until mostly dissolved then add 2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters of lime juice and 2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters of fish sauce whisk it together and adjust acidity and sweetness if needed i know i have more than three here that's because today the grocery store decided to only supply tiny little baby ugly garlic followed by two thai chilies that have been very thinly sliced whistled together and you've got a nakcham dressing now we're gonna assemble this similarly but with one small change get yourself one cucumber cut off the ends and cut it in half then using a mandolin or a sharp knife shave it into nice little ribbons like so almost like a pappardelle pasta now to assemble this it's very similar rehydrate one of your rice papers place it on your cutting board and evenly shingle four ribbons across the center of your rice paper keep them nice and uniform like this and press them down so that they stick then add your lettuce and your vermicelli noodles that look like i don't know like little intestines for some reason uh sorry that's gross your carrot herb salad from earlier then lightly dress those noodles in your nacho dressing more lettuce a generous handful of your fried shallots i mean look at that that alone would be a perfect roll add your seared and glazed spam i cut this one in half again so that it would fit a little better fold the right side over then the left side and yet again starting from the bottom roll all the way up and around to create the most beautiful almost green glizzy spring roll you know this looks so beautiful on the outside i think we need to get ourselves a little cross section and i mean other than that annoying noodle that's sticking right there that is one of the most beautiful cross sections i think i've ever seen now let's give these a little taste test we have the spam enhanced ultra glizzy goblin spring roll now this kind of has a little bit of reminiscence to the asian hawaiian combo of the spam misubi but now we've got sort of a vietnamese sort of combo going on with the spam [Music] sauce spam your chewing the fresh nakcham hits you've got the lettuce and then that salty fatty rich whippy and glazed spam hits you i mean i don't think you could make a better version of this there is a pork version of a spring roll this out does that by a million and billion petrillion is that a word turn number not a is that a number i don't know the difference i don't know different numbers but really whether you're more traditional you know you want the traditional shrimp lettuce a little bit of carrot nothing else cool then this is your your way to go but if you want to go on a roller coaster to flavor town then spam spring roll this peanut sauce is so good i don't have many words this is just so good honestly the spam one has more of an asian taste to it than this thank you for letting us eat jelly thank you but do you want to know what else is a green glizzy these are just making less and less sense every day [Music] b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made spring rolls first off humongous thank you and shout out to spam for sponsoring this video and for making these spring rolls one of the most delicious spring rolls i think i've ever made and you even saw vikram and tj both of them actually liked the spam one more we're really upping what we consider tradition and i think it's just one of those things you see respect being paid but you also bring in a new thing to sort of a traditional flavor and now you have these two combos that then make something greater than the sum of its parts kind of like how spam misubi was invented so i don't know if we invented a new spring roll but if we did hey remember the josh weissman coin and if you use it that'll be about 300 billion dollars so just just you know you could just keep a jug of this peanut sauce in your refrigerator and just maybe if you walk by the fridge you know pop the top take a little sip that's gross maybe not that but if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe

251,251,1 Dollar Fried Rice | But Cheaper,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2pfPNpFIKA4/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLDDoSXEubwR_MyfTx6CA6QM4xQOqw,2pfPNpFIKA4,"6 minutes, 49 seconds","Homemade fried rice is one of those cheap staples that every household in the world should know. It's fast, easy to make, relatively healthy, and well... it's rice and everyone loves rice come...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, so you want good take out fried rice we're gonna spend eight dollars when you can make all of this for about five dollars that's like a dollar per serving that's but cheaper [Music] fried rice commonly will get to go take out get delivered but we're talking anywhere between eight to fifteen maybe even twenty dollars which is just wrong it's something that can be done with leftovers and it's extremely extremely cheap and that is why it's on this episode of butt cheaper episode i don't know yeah hello what episode is it we figured out a way to get it essentially a dollar per portion now with that said that's if you have the majority of the ingredients if you don't have any of them meaning you have to buy all the ingredients then it's going to be like 20 for all of it and you'll then have all that stuff left in your kitchen that are usable through your time being live with all that said let's make this shall we now look we have an important conversation have despite the fact that rice is considered to be one of the most inexpensive ingredients in the world it can also be the greatest part of a meal by simply using proper technique now regardless of how you choose to cook your rice do me a favor and wash your rice i know i've complained about it before don't complain about it again so however much rice you're using get yourself a metal sieve place it over a bowl fill the bowl with water gently agitate in the water drain that water and repeat that one more time oh that actually reminds me the optimal choice for fried rice would either be a medium grain or jasmine rice or my personal preference which would be a short grain rice like sushi rice saying rice so much i might as well just count the amount of times that i say it so the first and most obvious method of cooking would be a rice cooker it massively reduces the chance of air and cooks rice perfect every time it's usually going to be about a one to one ratio of rice to water you'll put your rinsed rice in your water close the lid and well just press the start button and if you have the same model as mine you get to enjoy the song of its people now once that's done fluff it up with a spoon and you have beautifully cooked rice now the second method is considered a mortal sin by many people which is rice in a pot to make that you'll get yourself a medium sized pot with a lid add in one cup or 200 grams of cleaned rice and top with one and a half cups or 350 milliliters of water place it on the stove set the heat to medium high bring it to a boil then reduce immediately to a simmer cover it with a lid and let it lightly simmer for 15 minutes then remove it from the heat and let it steam an additional 15 minutes you pop that lay it off flip that boy up and well that's rice now the last and final method and this is like if you just are praying for some other method of cooking rice you don't have a pot but maybe you have a baking dish get yourself an eight by eight baking dish and you're gonna add one cup or 200 grams of cleaned rice spread it out nicely separately bring 2 cups or 475 grams of water to a vigorous boil then pour your boiling water over your rice cover it tightly with foil place it in the oven at 375 fahrenheit or 190 celsius for 25 to 30 minutes pull it out take off the foil and look at that you steamed rice in the oven now weird but it works now since fried rice is commonly made with leftover rice i'd actually recommend that you take your rice and then put it in the refrigerator and let it chill completely okay thank you for your patience now let's make our fried rice first let's begin by making our scrambled egg so get yourself three eggs cracked season it to taste with salt whisk them together and then in a non-stick skillet heat one tablespoon or 14 grams of unsalted butter you can also use oil once that's melted and bubbling add in your three eggs and let that cook over medium heat bringing in the sides occasionally until it's most of the way cooked give it a little flip let it cook the rest of the way on the other side then place it on a cutting board and give it a rough little chop now get yourself a small bowl and to that you're going to add 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of granulated sugar 3 tablespoons or 42 grams of soy sauce 1 tablespoon or 12 grams of white vinegar give it a little whisk three cloves of grated garlic and a one inch knob of grated ginger mix all that together and place to the side next begin heating a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat add in three tablespoons or 42 grams of a high heat cooking oil like vegetable oil once that's nice and hot add one diced carrot let that cook in saute until it's a little bit soft and starts to color then add in one bunch of green onions this is just the greens that have been sliced into about one inch segments let that cook until those greens get a little bit of color then add the whites of those same green onions which have been finely sliced you see we use the whole thing nobody has to cry so let that saute for an additional minute or so then add in 1 cup or 135 grams of frozen peas now look we don't want to overcook these i'm tired of disgusting mushy peas just keep that on high heat and keep stirring just until they're hot but still poppy then add 4 cups of cooked leftover rice now keep the pan ripping hot while stirring frequently until the rice is nice and hot maybe got a couple little crispy bits too then as your soy sauce vinegar mixture turn off the heat and mix it all together once that's mixed fold in your scrambled egg now at this point you're done optionally you can season this with sesame oil and of course season it to taste with salt if needed now all this put together for one to two dollars per serving i think it's time for a taste test so fried rice we got it it's oh little sound one dollar per portion if you want to make a big batch and you live alone you're single maybe sad that's fine but it'll make you happy that you didn't waste money meanwhile somebody's gonna be like i can just get a panda it's like three dollars you could go to panda spend time driving there and driving back so that's gas grand total still more expensive and it sucks this on the other hand for one you made and you can take pride in that depth of flavor you got to cook a little that's all i have to say fried rice is cheap as hell but cheaper this is rice this is nice i got diced no no lice rice is nice it's no expensive it's very cheap then but you want to know what else is cheap and full of rice b-roll [Music] okay so we made fried rice dollar per serving or like five six dollars per serving if you had to buy everything which is still cheaper than going out think about think about that for a second so i know that we've had like a lot of conversations about whether i should be in the cabinet off the cabinet this is your final opportunity comment let me know i felt like different series we should be out here i love my people so much i got your little dining set ah if my neighbors are watching through the window they're like this guy we need to call the police if you want to see anything on butt cheap or anything at all comment as well so anyway if you enjoyed this video or you learned

And look at that cross-section at 5:55. An unbelievably simple dough making...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, what you're about to see is one of the greatest most hands-off breads on the entire planet so without further ado let us [Music] begin [Music] okay so we're making focaccia yet again i'm talking the ultra bubbly really aerated beautiful kind that you see on instagram and all the other places that yes that are internet the beauty of this recipe is it's done days in advance it requires very minimal prep time i'm talking mix let it sit bake that's pretty much it but you probably already have the ingredients in your pantry right now so with all that said let's make this shall we two things to note this is very simple but i refuse to give you any other unit of measurement other than grams because that's how this should be done so if you have a problem with it you could turn 360 degrees and leave i love that joke see it's funny because if you turn 360 you would be facing the same yeah anyway get yourself a bowl of large stand mixer to that you're going to add 825 grams of bread flour and 150 grams of whole wheat flour stone ground whatever you want mix that together until thoroughly combined now to the side you're going to get 830 grams of water that's been heated to around 100 degrees fahrenheit or 37 degrees celsius go ahead and mix in and dissolve seven grams of instant yeast you can also use fresh yeast and if you want a sourdough version you'll need about 150 grams of mature sourdough starter if you want to go that route now with the dough hook attachment start mixing on low speed now add all of your water to the flour mix and mix that for 10 minutes you may have to scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally because it can be a little finicky getting to the bottom make sure all that flour gets hydrated after that 10 minutes is up add in 20 grams of fine sea salt and increase the mixer speed to medium low and mix for an additional 10 minutes yes a lot of mixing you got to do it now while that's mixing finally you're going to add 30 grams of extra virgin olive oil and mix for an additional three to five minutes or until beautifully incorporated now look this is where things can get a little bit difficult if you've never done this before but you're gonna dump the dough out onto a unfloured work surface it'll be really sticky and all over the place i know and you're going to pick it up like this slap it and fold it over itself and when you pick it back up to repeat that instead of grabbing it by those two open ends you're actually going to grab it where it folded from the front and the back grab it flip slap and fold again and rinse repeat this is called well slapping and folding you're gonna do this for about two minutes or until it's nice and smooth and not so sticky then get yourself a container that's three to four quarts in size you can also do it in a nine by 13 inch baking pan spray it with oil and also give it a little drizzle of olive oil toss your dough in cover with a grease lid or greased plastic wrap and then place it in your refrigerator for 48 to 72 hours yes that's it well i mean that's all you have to do but now you gotta wait now this is gonna develop all sorts of gas and flavor and all good things gas and flavor don't really combine well but you get the point now once it's baked day pull it out of the fridge look at all those bubbles i mean come on then get yourself a baking sheet give it a nice little spritz of spray oil and a generous drizzle of olive oil now carefully pull your dough out of your container sort of scraping it down you really want to be careful not to degass it you want to keep as much of that gas in there as possible and see me kind of gently maneuvering into a rough sort of rectangle don't stretch it too much and get it just stretch so it begins to get close to the edges of your pan cover it with another baking tray and wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature for two to three hours there he goes what are these for [Music] now once it's big time make sure that you've preheated your oven to as hot as it will physically go 500 to 550 degrees fahrenheit is ideal now get your best olive oil any sort of flavorings you can add tomatoes you can add castlevator olives whatever drizzle it heavily with olive oil don't go too skimpy here now to help retain its gas i actually prefer not to dimple it too much but you can absolutely dimple if you'd like then add the toppings that you want here i'm just gonna be adding a nice generous amount of za'atar and maybe a little bit of flaky salt then pop it in your oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until your desired color is achieved it's good to get a little char on there and that is your beautiful focaccia now ideally this is better when it's nice and warm but make sure to take it out of the container and have it cooling on a wire rack so the bottom doesn't get all gross and soggy okay this is a boobily focaccia it's shockingly easy but it has more culture more class more love and it can be done sourdough you all know how i feel about sourdough you can see how aerated it is you eat it and then you're like yeah hello don't do this by the way hey grandma i made focaccia today you should come over bye if you've never made focaccia before this will be the greatest focaccia that you ever make period end of story and if you have made it before same thing now let's see if we can sandwich it so get yourself a segment of your focaccia obviously cut it in half or sandwich get some nice ripe tomatoes cut them thinly and always season your tomatoes with salt okay i'm sick and tired of sandwiches where you don't season your tomatoes stop it get yourself about 6 slices of prosciutto place them in a cold pan heat it over medium heat flipping occasionally until nice and crispy and golden brown yes fried prosciutto is the way now we'll make a little mayo for that you'll need about a third cup of mayonnaise and two tablespoons of pesto this is the one from my gnocchi video the juice of half of a lemon and salt and pepper to taste that's it give it a little mix and you have a beautiful pesto mayo now to assemble this you're gonna add a generous amount of your pesto mayo on both sides of the bread don't go skimpy here all right add some lettuce of your choice here i have some little baby lettuce he's gonna go night night really soon when i crunch down on its flesh add your thinly sliced tomato which has been seasoned right right you see i'm watching papa is always watching followed by your crispy prosciutto i mean look at that it's a glistening some thinly sliced fresh mozzarella cheese this is truffle mozzarella not the flex but hit it with a little glug of nice extra virgin olive oil some fresh cracked black pepper then some nice genoa salami not to be mistaken with gourlami and optionally some thinly sliced greek pickled peppers add a little more lettuce just for some extra texture and crown your king i mean look at that is a behemoth of a sandwich cut it in half and reveal what i believe to be one of the greatest cross sections we've ever seen on the show of all time i mean it's juicy it's lucy and it's goosey now let's give it a taste test shall we boil truffle mozzarella salami fried prosciutto tomatoes lettuce pickles yeah this is this has got to be one of the greatest focaccia sandwiches or any sandwich for that matter that i've ever placed in my mouth upon my tongue well come try it oh i'll hold the camera i'm gonna be the cameraman that's amazing this is the single greatest sandwich i've put in my mouth yeah good job this is vikram all day by the way but you want to know what else is bubbly crunchy and beautiful [Music] b-roll [Music] anyway we made focaccia it turned out absolutely perfect it's beautifully aerated and soft and light and yet it has a nice structure too that can hold ingredients together perfectly what more do you want like i said before i know i already have a focaccia recipe but this one is extra special there's extra care and you can even have a sourdough option for it if you so desire we'll leave it at that with a quick one

I’m not necessarily trying to say they’re...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, so people keep saying i look like the colonel first off stop second off that means if anyone can beat him it's me [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so we're making the kfc famous bowl i thought a lot about this people were submitting all sorts of things the double down classic bucket and for some reason the famous bowl was the most listed which hilariously i've never heard of before well go get the famous bowl will taste test as usual to be honest with you guys you might be thinking well it's just fried chicken right no it's not just fried chicken there's there's a certain formula the certain 11 secret special whatever spices i think we can crack the code and i don't think it's gonna be that hard so with all that said let's do this shall we kfc kentucky fried chicken we're going all the way to kentucky in our minds oh it's a taco bell kfc yo they they've got they've got some sort of deal to keep each other alive they're like police people say that i look like colonel sanders but i'm kind of like the ugly version of him but i make better food so it doesn't matter hi can i do uh three famous bowls thank you so we got this stinky bowl so we've got whoa that is the chunkiest drop we've ever had the bag the kernel looking um looking like a this is so this is the famed bowl i've actually never seen this in my life we don't have a spork but we do have this big fork this is a bork it smells nice i can smell the plastic they put this in when it was too hot you catch them you can smell the plastic this was 16 for three of these pretty good two things to know chicken not bad it's good it's crispy i seasoned nicely and the potatoes on the other hand garbage garbage i'm saying it the corn the chicken the cheese tasty gravy tasty fine i'll i'll let them have that but what i will not let them have is these garbage potatoes i dislike them so much my mom would make mashed potatoes on the side from scratch and then we would eat the kfc with that all in all the bowl's pretty good you can't beat this price but we can definitely beat this flavor before we begin let's prep our chicken in a medium bowl add 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of stone ground mustard 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of white pepper 1 teaspoon or 7 grams of celery powder half a tablespoon or 8 grams of paprika and one tablespoon or 14 grams of kosher salt whisk that all together with two cups or 480 milliliters of buttermilk now wrassle yourself one and a half pounds or 680 grams of skinless chicken thighs cut those into one and a half inch evenly sized chunks now listen folks please get your chicken evenly sized otherwise they're going to cook unevenly and i'm going to have to give someone a spanking or something i don't know toss all of your cut chicken into the buttermilk marinade cover and fridge that bad boy for anywhere between 1 to 24 hours let's talk mashed taters i'm very passionate about mashed potatoes so please be respectful to your root vegetables get yourself about 3 pounds of either russet or yukon gold potatoes cut them into chunks and place them in a pot of water boil them until soft and drain them obviously you can peel or not peel that's up to you now in a small saucepan combine half a cup or 120 milliliters of whole milk and half a cup or 112 grams of unsalted butter heat that over medium heat until hot and melted so i like to run my potatoes through a ricer which will be in a link in the description but you can also just use a plain masher once all of your teeters are riced or mashed go ahead and mix in your hot butter milk mixture not buttermilk but like butter and milk yeah along with half a cup or 110 grams of creme fraiche or sour cream season that to taste with salt and pepper and you got your titers so since it's illegal to have potatoes without gravy we're gonna make some now mine has a little bit of a secret i flavor my chicken stock instead of flavoring my finished gravy and by that i mean take two and a quarter cup or 530 milliliters of good chicken stock put it in a sauce pot along with five dried mushrooms of choice these are home-grown oyster mushrooms bring them up to a simmer and then immediately turn off the heat then add a whole head of garlic sliced in half and optionally a small bundle of thyme now let all that steep in the hot broth for about 10 minutes strain out all the solids then in a medium sauce pot heat up four tablespoons or 56 grams of unsalted butter over medium heat until completely melted then whisk in four tablespoons or 35 grams of all-purpose flour let that cook while continuously whisking just a few more seconds so now you've made what the flench call a roux take your warm fortified stock and whisk that into your roux until all of it is added continually heat and whisk until thickened and you'll have a lovely gravy season to taste with salt and pepper and a generous pinch of msg yes we do that when we're competing with kfc oh you better believe it okay so this is the easiest part let's talk corn then just take a small bowl and place it inverted in a larger bowl shuck yourself some corn break off its corn weiner sorry then place that flat side of the corn on that smaller bowl and cut off all the kernels and then i'll leave you with a beautifully bare cob oh this reminds me you can also totally use this cob to steepen your chicken broth that you use for your gravy if you were to desire that it adds a nice little sweetness now get a small skillet or saucepan and heat three tablespoons or 42 grams of unsalted butter over medium heat and just let that continuously heat and bubble until it begins to brown not burn just brown then immediately turn off the heat and add your hardcore corn toss it in the butter till hot throughout and season it to taste with salt do not cook the corn i want that crunch now the time that we've all been waiting for let's talk secret 11 herbs and spices now obviously this is quite a bit of spices so get ready for a worthy one here so first you're obviously going to need two and a half cups or 375 grams of all-purpose flour and to that you're going to add 3 tablespoons or 30 grams of ground white pepper two and a half tablespoons or 32 grams of kosher salt three and a half tablespoons or 21 grams of paprika one and a quarter tablespoon or 21 grams of msg one tablespoon or six grams of ginger powder ah still there okay one tablespoon or nine grams of mustard powder two teaspoons or two grams of dried thyme one tablespoon or twelve grams of garlic powder two teaspoons or two grams of dried oregano two teaspoons or five grams of celery powder and finally one tablespoon or 11 grams of fresh ground tilled cherry or the lassa berry black pepper it's a lot i know but we got to stay true here now whisk all that together until thoroughly combined and you have your secret kfc dredge now to dredge your chicken using one hand for wet and one for dry remove your chicken from the marinade and toss in the flour making sure to coat and press every crevice so you have a beautifully coated piece of chicken like this place that on a baking sheet that's been dusted with more seasoned flour than just repeat with all of your chicken now to fry that just get yourself about two to three inches of depth for your fry oil making sure it doesn't go beyond about halfway up whatever pot you choose heat that to 350 degrees fahrenheit or 175 degrees celsius then carefully lower in your cheeky then fry in batches until you get beautiful golden brown and crispy pieces of chicken about three to five minutes obviously make sure your chicken is cooked all the way through as well you know we don't no medium rare alright repeat that with all of your sweet kentucky fried placing them on a baking sheet lined with a wire rack to drain and that's your chicken so we've gone through the trenches of deep gravy up the hills of mount potato now we must assemble our famous bowl so sure you could just dump your potatoes into a bowl but be a whole lot cuter if you place your potatoes in a piping bag with a star tip and pipe your potatoes into your bowl like this you know for the fine dining flecks obviously now hit those gorgeous potato valleys with some gravy follow that with your brown butter corn then that beautiful crunchy chicken a little more gravy then grate some nice cheese on top don't go skimpy here this is a lovely aged gruyere and optionally albeit untraditional some very finely sliced chives now that looks like a chicken dinner if i've ever seen one so you want to talk famous bull let's talk famous bowl i think we don't even need to eat this to know that we've won let's be honest i said this the very first but better that we ever did you versus the guy she told you not to worry about if that's the situation just break up with her bro it's over she already picked the winner first off piped potatoes my god hey yo christmas check it sounds like i'm saying christmas i mean chicken winner this is this is nuts honestly this is i have to stop myself i'm sorry it's over so such a clear win i'm not even gonna really describe it but the potatoes are perfect they're rich but not overly so it's so good i'm not even chewing all the way ah both my sides are seizing up right now my body's shutting down because it thinks this is my last meal we won thank you so much i don't even want to bring on a taste tester but we will this is a man who values the kfc name and i respect that and so tj we got the gaff tape glasses this time this is a uh pre-manufactured idea we have the kfc we have mine we're gonna give him a little swisher rooney take your fork and i want you oh that's my arm this is number number one cool there you go go ahead and go to the second one my god no this one went these potatoes actually have like texture to them the other ones are just kind of like powder i'm gonna take my lunch break he's just kidding he's not gonna take his next break back to where we won butt better episode 18. i remember this time because we whipped their ass so bad at the end of the day if anyone's gonna be licking fingers it's gonna be kfc slobbing on mine yikes update time to turn the cameras off do you want to know what else looks like the colonel no not me please stop saying it b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made the kfc famous bowl did we win wow buy a line violence so good i can't even talk red anymore we won by an absolute landslide it was it wasn't even a competition sorry about it i don't even know if i would say that i was nervous but i wasn't sure if we would be able to get anywhere near it now do i think the flavor was exactly the same no it wasn't if it was it wouldn't be better but i do think that we got close to that sort of like spice profile and what is the secret what is that secret again oh man what oh yeah monosodium glutamate that does so much for the flavor of the chicken you cannot even imagine that's why the crust is so addictively good so regardless of the spices you put in there if you add msg i mean obviously it's gonna lift it so yeah but the spices we've chosen this they've got that sort of kick they've got that savory quality to them long story short kfc you're gonna have to lick this finger on here brother

That's the beauty of it. You...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, typically when i make pasta people are like gosh i don't have that fancy roller or this or that but if you're making gnocchi you probably already have the ingredients and you don't need any fancy tools okay so we're making gnocchi now i was gonna post a gnocchi recipe a long time ago i'm talking like years ago i never did fast forward now we're here wow very cool before we even talk about that i need to go over something okay the last video someone commented got top comment i don't know why asking me to make a book called something like a weissman once said or let me just level with you guys love the idea um how do i see this um no no no uh no gnocchi's super easy you only need potatoes egg flour and that's it actually oh and all salt after that you can make gnocchi so with all that said let's make this shall we gnocchi is so easy you don't even need a recipe matter of fact you shouldn't because every potato isn't exactly the same now start off with three big boy russet potatoes around 2 pounds place those in a pot and cover with good old h2o that's science for water bring it up to a boil and boil your titers for 30 to 45 minutes or until easily pricked with a fork but not total mush pull them out and peel their skins off you can do this by hand or you can use a peeler i peel them afterwards to avoid water log ow now from here we need to mash them while they're hot how you do that is up to you i personally think a potato ricer like this one works really well and getting it nice and fine and i'll have a link in the description with the one that i use but hey a good forkin or with a hand masher is also totally cool mash till completely smooth then let your potatoes cool just enough so they don't hurt your little thingies when you mix from there you'll add one large egg give that a mix till thoroughly combined and a generous pinch of salt then start mixing in some all-purpose flour a small handful at a time just until it starts to come together begin kneading and adding flour intermittently until it comes together to a beautiful smooth bouncy dough that shouldn't be too sticky like this you'll have added around one and a half to two cups or 225 grams to 300 grams of flour look doing it by eye you'll learn a lot better and it's more fun you gotta get a feel for the dough now once your gnocchi dough is ready divide into four even pieces then dust one of those segments of dough with flour as needed and begin rolling into a long tube sort of like a funny potato snake of sorts till it's nice and long and about three quarters of an inch thick and cut that into segments that are about one inch long using either a bench scraper or knife then continue that with all of your dough now to help speed this up you could totally bring the homies over and well obviously to kiss you good night but yes speed now once you've got your little gnocchi's you can either call it a day and use them as is or if you want to add some functional shape you can use a gnocchi roller or even a fork to press and roll your gnocchi to get this nice creased design now the reason i do this is because duh it looks cute as a cuason but it also helps hold more sauce and you guys know how i feel about sauce once those are done place the finished gnocchi on a baking sheet generously dusted with flour now before we boil and go to flavor town let's first discuss some sauces first up pesto i love me a traditional hand ground pesto but this more modern version has superior coatability simply take a 30 cup or 55 grams of pine nuts place them in a cold pan and heat over medium heat stirring often until lightly toasted in a blender you're gonna add two large handfuls about two cups of fresh basil three cloves of fresh garlic peeled obviously please 1 cup 90 grams of grated parmigiano reggiano a little bit of salt and pepper to taste your toasted pine nuts from earlier now begin blending that now you're probably gonna have to add a small splash of water just barely enough to loosen it don't add too much or otherwise it'll get too thin i added a little too much here oops once it becomes nice and smooth while it's blending stream in a half cup or 120 milliliters of extra virgin olive oil you can also add a little more if you want it creamier but i think that's a good amount right there and immediately place your pesto into a container now you can cool it down from here in an ice bath if you want to retain that color i'm using mine immediately so i didn't but just be aware that this oxidizes really fast now the next part's super easy take your gnocchi get some water boiling season your water generously with kosher salt toss in 10 or so pieces of gnocchi per person and you're gonna boil this for about a minute potentially less or until they begin to float then get yourself a bowl use a spider to remove your gnocchi place your hot gnocchi into the bowl along with a generous amount of your pesto to taste of course add a splash or two of your pasta water stir aggressively to get that nice and emulsified and that is your pesto gnocchi place your gnocchi in a shallow bowl along with some extra sauce add some fresh grated parmigiano reggiano a little bit of fresh cracked black pepper and that is a pesto gnocchi now let's taste this all right it's pesto time i feel like a lot of people are going to complain about this because they're like oh yes it's not traditional you got to do it with a mortar and pestle and italian grandmothers would probably be disrespected by this and i understand respect and understand all i have to say is i know that massimo batura one of the chefs of literally voted the best restaurant in the world three michelin star austria franciscana okay he does he blends his pesto sometimes and emulsifies it so if he does it it's okay also look how beautiful stunning first off stunning look at this this beautiful vibrance i mean that is that's how it should be i mean it's totally perfect melts in your mouth it's healthy i'm just making you want to cry tears of pesto that's emulsified perfectly into beautiful vibrant green sauce out of my tear ducts i mean this is actually like one of the better pestos i've ever had and you pick up a piece of when you pick up when you pick up a piece of gnocchi you get that like rich pesto through and through it doesn't miss anything there's it's not like falling all off of it i mean this is a better application because it sticks better calm and crazy now next up we're doing another non-traditional sauce which is sauce mornay get yourself a medium sized sauce pot to that you're gonna add one and a half tablespoons or 28 grams of unsalted butter heat that over medium heat as soon as that butter melts add in one and a half tablespoons or 17 grams of all-purpose flour whisk that together and let that cook and toast for about a minute or so keep whisking constantly and then from there you're going to slowly add 1 cup or 240 milliliters of warm whole milk whisking constantly keep going keep pouring and mixing until all of your milk is added and you have a nice smooth beautifully thickened sauce reduce the heat to low continue mixing once your sauce reaches a consistency like this turn the heat off and add half a cup or 35 grams of grated gruyere cheese and a quarter cup or 21 grams of grated parmigiano reggiano now i know i know it's not traditional okay i'll explain later then just whisk all that together until beautifully smooth creamy and cheesy finish your sauce with a little bit of salt and pepper to taste and a little bit of fresh grated nutmeg just a few minutes at room temp this will begin to sort of get crusty so just keep it heated and stirring until you're ready to use it make sure not to burn or boil it now again boil your gnocchi just until it begins to float pull it out put it in a bowl add a generous amount of your sauce mornay toss in a little splash of your pasta water and mix aggressively and look at this beautifully emulsified sauce looks kind of reminiscent to mac and cheese almost finish it with fresh grated parmesan reggiano and a little bit fresh cracked black pepper broth thank you ah yes another unconventional use of gnocchi you guys are probably really unhappy with me right now at the end of the day gnocchi we made i feel like relatively traditionally the sauces are up to you i made uh essentially what i would consider starts as a bechamel when you add cheese and then what does it become vikram what does it become tj what does it become nobody it's a no not a hollandaise vikram's like it becomes a mornay sauce technically french and we did make it we did make it the traditional french way but there's nothing wrong with putting that on yogi on beautiful pillowy voluptuous gnocchi matter of fact ah it went to the back of my throat oh essentially what we did make though is is mac and cheese for anybody was wondering what morning sauce really is it's a bechamel that you've added cheese to what is mac and cheese a best smell add cheese to this is maca gnocchi and cheese it's like mac and cheese but more sexy okay one more this one's gonna be a fried sage butter gnocchi nice and crispy too to do that get yourself a 10 inch non-stick skillet toss in three and a half tablespoons or 50 grams of unsalted butter set that over medium heat let that melt now once that's nice and hot and bubbling toss in half a bunch of fresh sage let that cook for about 10 seconds or just until it begins to get a little fragrant now on the side i've got my gnocchi boiling again once the gnocchi is fully cooked you're then going to remove it place it in a hot sage butter season the taste of salt give it a little toss now let that sit undisturbed for about two to three minutes or just until it gets beautifully crispy and crunchy and golden on one side flip and repeat on the other side now from there you actually can serve it directly out of the pan get yourself a bowl daintily place your gnocchi in your fried sage leaves into that bowl drizzle a little bit of the butter on top and finish with some fresh parmesan reggiano and that's all you need beauty and simplicity my friends stay in there we've seen this one all over the internet i'm so tired of the term sage brown butter but that's what it is but i'm also sick of hearing it all the food bloggers are like so today i mean sage brown butter cookies and i also made a sage brown butter pancakes this is uh basically a fried gnocchi fried in the pan it's not deep fried it's nice and glossy you've got some parmesan reggiano that you've shredded on top there we go and we get a little leaf of fried sage which crunchy and flavorful you know i hate on the sage brown butter and yet it always comes through the flavor texture the richness it's not too rich put more butter in here if you want and just have it like swimming in butter which is what most places will do actually but the gnocchi itself is like beautifully cooked the inside it's bouncy melts in your mouth it's rich it's developed a nice sort of like crispy crust i mean you could hear it here all these sauces are really easy to make but this one for some reason hits the home the best it's great for it's great for winter this is a little bit heavy for right now i'm gonna go to sleep now this is sort of like all encumbering very simple way to make your milk so go to bed have a good sleep wake up make some gnocchi stop saying that you're gonna make it because the time is now do you want to know what else this plump can be coated in sauce and then placed in your mouth b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made gnocchi the italian dumpling of voluptuous almost like a sleepover pillow that's just so perfect you want to sleep on it i might have had some complications with the power going out but that doesn't matter i know i did use a potato ricer you don't have to do that you can mash it with a masher you can use a fork you could squeeze it with your bare hands if you're a barbarian sure fine i'll only judge you a lot whatever method you choose you're gonna be satisfied it's a ton of fun to make with people and you can put it in any sauce you want it's just a chewy vehicle of pillowy goodness so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something yeah or okay bye papa love you okay that's it [Music] you

Crab meat is expensive... it's just a fact of life! But let me walk you through the easiest and cheapest...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, oh crab cakes so overpriced 14 to 20 for two cakes of crab so to that i say crab cakes but cheaper [Music] okay so when you order crab you're basically signing up to work for your food we all know this i don't have a huge problem with it but at the end of the day you'll have eaten a whole family of crabs by the time you feel full but the people of maryland have found a great workaround the fishermen at the chesapeake bay area are the best at getting to the crab meat they get that they put some magic in it and bam crab cakes or something like that i don't really know the full story but so the irony about crab cakes being so extraordinarily expensive is the fact that they are incredibly easy to make so really you're not saving yourself that much time you might as well drop to the lowest possible option in cost and then just make it yourself you know what else is easy bundling your home and car insurance and that's where today's episode's sponsor geico comes in combining your home and car insurance could save you even more for bundling made easy visit geigo.com today and head to the link in the description to see how much you could save but cheaper episode four so this is gonna be a little bit different how do we shrink the price of a crab cake as small as it will go so that's what we're going to do let's make this shall we all right let's talk crab here for starters the average crab cake costs about 10 to 12 per oceanic cake which is absurd so let's start at the heart of the conversation crab choice now we have two options here either fresh crab this one is dungeness and pre-picked crab now the pre-picked stuff cost me about like 24 for a full pound of lump crab yes this is real crab meat i checked okay don't at me now alternatively this fresh crab came in at about one and a half pounds for 19 now already it looks like the fresh crab could win but first we gotta dig in a little bit further so let's go ahead and break down all of that crab remove every little ounce of meat we can gently carefully lovingly as you know now once all that is done turns out we were left with barely over half a pound of actual crab meat which means that we paid 19 for half a pound of meat it's 38 dollars per pound bruv first off what in the quest is this trickery so pre-picked so peep this is really hard to say the crab that has already been picked wins this pricing round but where does it stand in the flavor department now to make them thicko mode cakes we're going to use the same recipe for both types of crab here so get yourself a medium sized bowl and to that you're going to add half a cup or 110 grams of mayonnaise 1 tablespoon or 15 grams of good mustard dijon ideally 1 tablespoon or 15 grams of wurst shark shire sauce sorry two teaspoons or 10 grams of hot sauce the zest of one lemon one teaspoon or five grams of sea salt black pepper to taste whisk that together until thoroughly combined then whisk in one large egg now from here just toss in your crab meat carefully fold it together we're not trying to turn this into shredded crab okay try to keep the chunks in there as best as you can now once it's mixed nicely add three quarters of a cup or 45 grams of panko bread crumbs or crushed saltine crackers again mix until thoroughly combined be really really careful at this stage it tends to tear up here so you know the gentler the better the gentler the better you want those nice chunks now take those bad boys and form them into eight even patties now here you can see me forming them into six that was completely by accident apparently i don't know how to count um this should make eight patties i was wondering why they were so large you can also do six larger patties if you want good job josh very good now since the other one only had half a pound of crab meat in it then we only had four but here's our crab side to side now obviously there's a little bit of a difference the fresh crab is a little more vibrant colored it smells a little more fragrant we're pretty much done at this point all you gotta do now is get a 12-inch skillet add in a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of oil for frying canola or peanut oil place it on your stove and set the heat to medium high once that oil is shimmering and is nice and hot now shallow fry those in batches to avoid overcrowding for three to four minutes or until beautifully crispy brown flip and shallow fry for an additional three to four minutes then take them out of the pan drain on a plate also i ran out of paper towels and the washing machine was broken so it's on a plain plate but really what what is going on today josh all right you good now that's it that's that's the crab cakes that's all you have to do now obviously i repeated this process with the fresh ones as well the fresh ones looking a little springier a little more nice and now we're ready to dig in now before we do that you can optionally make a little french remoulade and to do that you're going to start with a medium-sized bowl with one egg yolk in there two teaspoons or 10 grams of dijon mustard and the juice of one lemon and some salt and pepper to taste whisk all that together and then while constantly whisking slowly stream in three quarters of a cup or 180 milliliters of neutral tasting oil like canola oil now obviously we're making a mayo you could also just opt for three quarters of a cup of mayo if you just want to skip this process but you guys know how i feel about homemade stuff don't hurt my feelings okay papa does this for you once you've added all of your oil and you have a nice beautiful emulsified mayonnaise go ahead and add three and a half tablespoons or 35 grams of finely chopped pickles or cornichons one finely chopped shallot crush two cloves of garlic and begin chopping together with two anchovy fillets and a little bit of salt and just chop and spread with the flat side of your knife over and over until you get a beautifully fine garlic anchovy paste add that to your remoulade along with half a bunch of chives that have also been finely chopped and some salt and pepper to taste now look okay i know we've gone beyond uh but cheaper here i did this completely for myself but i figured people would whine that i didn't give you the recipe so i'm not including that in the pricing sorry about it now all there's left to do is get your crab cakes line them up place them next to your expensive potential remoulade that you might have made or not some lemon cheeks we only cheek around here all right toss on some extra chives now let's get our final verdict on pricing and flavor fresh picked versus the pre-picked huge price difference first off obviously as we have mentioned this is not like a let me figure out how to make a crab cake for 25 cents look grabs expensive that's a fact of life [Music] i can't change that what i can do is we can look at both of these and try and decide what the best possible value in a crab cake you can get and it is not going to a restaurant because that is the most overpriced you'll ever get now let's start with the pre so it's good salt level nice it's good it's good again exact same recipe so here we go second one you can tell this is fresh just by looking at it look at the texture this is the fresh one and then this is the pre-pick look at that completely stark difference fresh one that's too good i'm gonna level with you let me be honest this is miles better but it's also twice the price for me i would be willing to go the extra mile and get this now granted that's my own personal opinion now if you just really want crab cakes that are delicious this for this price and this for this price i'll dip some in the sauce see if the sauce helps well wait no that one's already too good i mean yeah the thing is is it it doesn't taste bad what do you think i think this tastes bad it's crab cakes of course it tastes good at the end of the day if you are looking for the absolute cheapest option physically possible it is making your own at home from scratch using the pre-picked stuff that is as low as crab cake is ever going to go while still using real crab but do you want to know what else has mad crab cakes b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it thanks again to my friends at geico for sponsoring this episode they're helping me with my culinary journey around the united states and they want to help you too by helping you save money on your home and car insurance so head down to that link down below and visit geico.com today now let's talk about these cakes of crap i know that this isn't like oh my gosh josh you didn't make this for 25 cents per crab cake obviously not i can't control the price of crab that's why they put market price on the gosh darn menu well that's actually not why that's what that's because they it's a strategy of up charging you technically but we won't get into that my main point is what we did here was we looked at a lot of different options and we really distilled it down to the cheapest possible way to make crab cakes now if you're the type of person that's like my time is worth more than that then the money you're saving well then what what are you doing them but cheaper huh the point is crab cakes are overpriced and you you really can save a pretty large chunk of money just by making it yourself and it's so easy and fun to make you might as well just do it right and you can control the flavor you guys know how i feel about having control but anyway

256,256,The Perfect Breakfast Sandwich (2 Ways),https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5ro6o3gpyAw/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBhy_KNlZhvOQMguEccrVbv2_YCNg,5ro6o3gpyAw,"9 minutes, 28 seconds","Homemade breakfast sandwiches are something enjoyed across the world. Everyone loves em, but there is definitely a way we could improve on every single layer that makes up this perfect breakfast...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, whether you eat breakfast or not we all love breakfast food bacon potatoes eggs yeah but there's one vessel that is the greatest way to combine all into a nice little parcel the breakfast sandwich [Music] there's many ways to do it right we know the classic new york style bacon egg and cheese on a bagel perfection we all love it we know it we respect it then there's the deli style on toast i'd like to talk about just two main ones that i personally love for one we're gonna run through sort of an egg  inspired one alvin if you're watching papa i love you and then we're gonna look at more of like a deli inspired sort of one pan breakfast sandwich there's many ways to make a breakfast challenge but i think these are my top two so with all that said let's make this shall we okay so we're gonna start this one off with a classic the bacon egg and cheese and if you're on tik tok it might be pronounced with a rendition that i believe to be one of the best now let's first talk about bread i prefer to have some sort of like a brioche or a milk bun rather than toast obviously you should make your own okay that should go without saying and this is the exact same recipe that i used for my hamburger bun video which will be in the link in the description it's easy to make you really should do it and i'll judge you only a little if you don't i ran out of space in my mouth to assemble the rest of this you're going to take two sweet onions chop the top and the root off then slice it in half lengthwise then slice with the grain to get these beautiful little thin juliennes melt a couple tablespoons in a medium sized sauce pot toss in your onions season lightly with salt and optionally a tiny sprinkle of sugar that'll help with caramelizing then cook that on medium-low heat stirring occasionally as they get darker and darker and until they get beautifully caramelized now while i'm doing this you may need to add a little splash of water here and there to deglaze if it starts getting too dry but once they're nice and dark like this you now have caramelized onions also if you really want to be chefo mode you should double check the salt levels when they're done now let's get our bacon ready i know a lot of people prefer the skillet method and that's fine but if you don't know about the bacon method but you literally just line a baking sheet with bacon put it in a cold oven and then turn the oven to 425 and let it cook for 25 to 30 minutes or until beautifully browned and cooked to your level of crispness and that's it just rain it and you're done you've now maximized bacon while minimizing effort congratulations now one last quick throw together component would be a spicy mayo if you desire that papa knows about your desires each and every one of them papa will oblige mix together half a cup 112 grams of mayonnaise with one tablespoon or 14 grams of sriracha or a hot sauce of your choice two teaspoons or eight grams of worcestershire sauce i i did it everybody i did it i pronounced worcestershire sauce can i get a round of applause please uh i'd like to thank the academy um i knew this day would come and uh just so proud of uh practicing so much by saying work disturbing and a little bit of salted taste and optionally if you want to add some fresh garlic you can too mix that together and that's your spicy mayo okay so we're making scrambled eggs but we're not gonna make traditional scrambled eggs i'm talking soft scrambled and i have a special technique for you we all know the gordon ramsay pan on pan off method but this one is gonna involve a double boiler so get yourself a small saucepan fill it up with just about an inch of water bring that to a light simmer and then place a large bowl on top of it so that the bowl does not touch the water at all and just gets the bottom of it steamed then crack in eight total eggs and toss in two tablespoons or 28 grams of unsalted butter yes cold now do not season it with salt yet or anything now while that's simmering you're going to use a whisk and you're going to constantly whisk this while it's gently getting double boiled and look this is going to take a while it's going to take about five to eight minutes so just keep whisking and whisking don't talk and then you'll notice it's slowly coming together it'll start to curd a little bit keep whisking keep whisking until it comes together into a beautiful very fine curd soft scrambled egg it shouldn't be runny per se but it should definitely fall off of a spoon and be nice and bouncy like so then take that immediately off the heat whisk in an additional 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of unsalted butter and 1.5 tablespoons or 17 grams of crumb fresh and half a bunch of chives thinly sliced then season a taste with salt and pepper and now it's time to assemble get your buns slice them in half get yourself a pan or a flat top get it nice and buttered up heat it over medium heat until the butter is hot and bubbling and toast your buns until beautifully golden brown on each cut side now to assemble get your toasted bun pop that brother open listen that doesn't sound good so with a nice healthy layer of your spicy mayo followed by a healthy spoonful of caramelized onions two slices of bacon that have been folded over and a generous helping of your beautiful soft scrambled egg add a little more caramelized onion top with a slice of cheese of your choice this is cheddar now the way i chose to melt this was with a little blowtorch it's easy and it's a flex but you can also use a broiler then just crown your king and marvel in its beauty this is a beautiful sandwich you know it's very reminiscent if you guys know about egg i believe alvin kailan if you're watching papa love you this is a little bit of a rendition of that in a way yep you ever eat something so good that you just gotta run out of frame that's what kind of antics this will put you at you've got the buns you already know my buns the egg is like melts in your mouth perfectly soft scrambled i don't want to hear anything josh that egg is under cooked it's right no you don't know what you're talking about right second it's perfect this is my my ideal breakfast sandwich the only downside is eating it is a little bit difficult and messy spicy mayo soft scrambled eggs perfect buns this is my opinion the perfect breakfast sandwich so we've done the ultra fancy one now we're gonna do a ultra lazy version okay so we did the ultra fancy sandwich but what if we made an ultra easy breakfast sandwich which would start with any typical slices of store-bought bread or you can make your own store-bought bread which i also have in the link in the description wow look at this marketing now in a medium-sized bowl crack yourself three whole eggs season it the taste of salt and pepper and whisk it together oh my gosh josh is seasoning this salt before cooking yeah shut up heat a 10 inch non-stick skillet over medium heat toss in a couple tablespoons of butter or a knob if you're english and once that's melted and bubbling and nice and hot add in your egg then take two slices of bread soak on one side then flip them over so both sides are now soaked and then just let that sit on medium heat for about one to three minutes or until that egg is cooked nearly all the way through then carefully flip that whole mass over the bread should stick to it yeah that looks crazy right then add in some cheese i've got some gouda and some smoked cheddar some ham which i've lightly seared on the side then fold the right side of the egg over then the left side then fold that sandwich together and that's it pull it out of the pan wait a couple seconds for that cheese to melt slice into it and then enjoy a beautiful cheese pull open that bad boy up and well uh i promise it tasted good despite how provocative this may look now let's taste our seductive breakfast so we got a deli style egg bake we have a we have a deli style ham egg and cheese this whole technique i saw on like one instagram video and i was like that's kind of cool that's one of the few times that you see an instagram clip and you're like i want to do that because most of the time it's like did you know you could take cheetos and crush them and also use them as makeup so one downside with this method this doesn't look quite right but it it still has the essence of what it should be so without without further ado i mean it's good i don't like egg that's gone like full on all rubber i know a lot of people like their eggs like that so this really does taste sort of like an american deli classic i suppose you could say but not quite as good the bread needs to be toasted a little more but man you could throw this thing together in like a two minute sandwich in one pan i mean weighing the flavor pro con solid breakfast sandwich long story short breakfast sandwiches we have two different varieties we've got the deli kind sort of made all in one pan and then we've got soft scramble almost egg style both of which very good if you're a breakfast sandwich person you now have one of two choices here it's up to you to decide which is the best but do you want to know what else is seductive and edible b-roll [Music] guys and that is it so we made breakfast sandwiches now i think that the first one that we made the fancier version i personally much preferred that one i think the second one could have been much better now the whole one pan method's not something that i normally do actually i would typically probably fry my eggs or do something of that nature which by the way obviously either of these applications are completely doable with a fried egg so don't at me and be like josh you didn't do a version with a fried egg how am i supposed to oh just fry the egg just keep all the other components exactly the same and just fry the egg please just use a little intuition okay i'm obviously getting a little bit annoyed i apologize i'm getting passionate about this you don't need papi to tell you now when i typically make a deli breakfast sandwich the one thing i would say about the deli breakfast sandwich is two things i would have the eggs fried i would put hash browns and i would put cheese now that is my own particular choice but i thought this one pan method would be easy for the people who want the quick and easy stuff there's a little piece of advice for you if you're looking for the real version of the deli sandwich merch is coming there's more merch coming but i'm working on a bigger project which is why i've delayed merch people that i'm working with we all think that it could potentially revolutionize the apron market so not to flex but that's kind of a big deal to me and i feel like we might be on something interesting here now do i know for sure what's gonna happen no not at all but i do really want to make this something special for you guys whatever it ends up being but until then we will have merch coming anyway bye bye [Music] you

time that we also venture a little bit into the coveted snack world [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back to but better episode episode 17. i'm doing this for a little while huh for the record we're going to keep doing fast food don't worry that's not going away that's the whole baseline of the series but i also want to start doing snacks because a lot of people have requested it a lot but igdms blah blah blah so on and so forth you keep asking me i don't really make cheese powders that often but i do make cheese foams but you know we're gonna give this our best shot and we can see how close can we get to a dorito and can we make it better so with all that said let's make this shall we we're not gonna go to 7-eleven because 7-eleven i feel like they're not gonna like a camera in there or what's the place that people just don't care walmart look at this these are new poppables i mean i like the concept but why okay um okay doritos should we get the party size doritos is over party what is the difference between these but there's more air here's the air here's the air this is the same amount of chips you're already on the down right now for the first time we truly have the bag the sound of this triggers my remember when i was like in class and i would like try to open a bag of chips without the teacher hearing and it's like so doritos uh they've rebranded so often this is like this new brand is so aggressive why doritos why do they need to be so aggressive they're they're nacho cheese chips all right you don't need a lasers crunching and slicing through your lettering just for epic gamers only epic gamers this is for you you got the classic doritos smell right i wish more of these were triangular the majority of them are actually like all like half pieces i mean they're doritos like they're they're kind of good they're kind of good the one thing i have to say about doritos they're nacho cheese flavored no this tastes nothing like cheese i don't even know how to describe this they taste like doritos which tastes good so what if we made an actual nacho cheese flavored chip now first things first let's make our flavor powder so i thought for a while exactly how i'm gonna make this so i looked around on amazon turns out cheese powder is actually really easy to find and so i just bought some cheddar cheese powder some white cheese powder you know the links will be in the description for that so for this method in a bowl you're gonna combine one cup or 112 grams of cheddar cheese powder a quarter cup of 30 grams of white cheddar cheese powder a quarter cup or 35 grams of buttermilk powder that's optional two and a half tablespoons or 15 grams of nutritional yeast yeah okay it sounds gross but it's kind of tasty so two teaspoons or seven grams of msg yes you heard correctly if doritos is gonna do it i'm doing it too all right one tablespoon or seven grams of onion powder two teaspoons or six grams of smoked paprika and finally one tablespoon or 14 grams of fine sea salt give that some whiskey business until thoroughly combined and that is your cheese powder flavoring so it turned out a little more neon than i expected okay so let's talk about making chips of course you can mix together your masa flour ideally it would be better if you had nyx tamale and all that and ground your own corn but let's be humble for a second okay we're making cheese powdered chips if you want it fast just buy some corn tortillas place the whole tortillas evenly spaced apart on a baking sheet toss them in an oven at the lowest setting possible for 10 minutes to dry them out and then cut them into quarters and now they're ready to fry then all you really have to do is get a large heavy bottom pot fill it up with at least two inches of oil make sure it doesn't go any higher than the halfway mark of the pot otherwise it's a fire hazard and that is bad now you just take that there pot of oil place it on a stove top over medium heat all right i'm gonna stop that now and heat that until it reaches around 350 degrees fahrenheit or 175 degrees celsius for my metric homies then in batches making sure not to overcrowd the pot fry your chips for about two to three minutes submerging them and flipping them every so often so that they get evenly fried and as soon as those chips sort of stop frying and bubbling and they're just kind of floating there you're then going to remove them from the oil place them on a wire rack set over a baking sheet and then immediately dust with your cheese powder now notice how i'm not sprinkling here it really works a lot better if you're using a fine mesh sieve and just kind of tapping it out that way we want that real even coating then just give those chips a flip and dust them yet again with your cheese mixture i know that you might think oh well joshua can i just toss it in a bowl yeah that's a practical thought but it doesn't really work very well and if for some reason the cheese powder isn't sticking to the other side just get a spray bottle fill it with a little bit of vegetable oil and lightly spray them prior to dusting them and it should definitely stick that way then just rinse and repeat with the rest of your chips and that right there well it actually looks kind of different than a dorito but okay maybe we go back to the drawing board and try to make our own cheese powder get any cheese that you want and you're gonna slice it as thinly as physically possible kind of tough to do uh with a knife that's super flat like this but here i've got some parmigiano-reggiano obviously some cheddar cheese some pecorino romano and finally some gouda all right the dutch are already screaming it's how the rauda i don't i don't know i'm trying then place those on some dehydrator sheets evenly spaced apart assuming you have a dehydrator place them in your dehydrator which has been set to 125 degrees fahrenheit or 52 degrees celsius and let them dehydrate for anywhere between 24 to 48 hours or until they're completely dry and crisp and snappable then take them out you're gonna need to generously dab these off by the way because they they just release so much cheese oil i was not stoked about that but you do what you gotta do then just blend those separately okay don't blend them all at once blend those separately on a high speed blender as high as it'll go until you get a nice powder rinse and repeat with every cheese then grab yourself a bowl now this one's a mouthful so get ready three tablespoons are 20 grams of nutritional yeast which i'm actually running through a fine mesh sieve just to get it a little bit finer than the last time followed by half a cup or 60 grams of gouda powder a quarter cup or 30 grams of pecorino romano powder half a cup or 60 grams of parmigiano-reggiano powder half a cup or 60 grams of cheddar cheese powder i'm sorry this is just funny one tablespoon or 14 grams of fine sea salt obviously you're two teaspoons of msg muy importante let me tell you brother two teaspoons or seven grams of ground white pepper one tablespoon or ten grams of onion powder and one tablespoon or twelve grams of smoked paprika give that some whiskey business and that is our secondary seasoning it's the exact same procedure fry your chips season them generously with your cheese powder and now we've got two different chips we've got the store-bought cheese powder we've got the dehydrated cheese powder and then we've got the dorito now let's see which version of ours tastes the closest and if we want [Music] they all look relatively similar but you can definitely visually tell which one the doritos are pre-made cheese powder first off this slaps but it doesn't exactly taste like doritos i don't know that that's necessarily bad now this is made with real cheese weirdly enough the the homemade cheese powder actually matches the flavor of the doritos way closer and i think that has to do with the umami qualities of the cheeses being intensified msg elves god this is a tough one you know i need i need thick one time for the sideshow [Music] good [Applause] yeah number three which one do you think the doritos are three yeah it's just so obvious it's it's a pretty iconic now between the first two which do you think was closer so the second one was it was cheesier i'd say cheese wise the second one is closer i kind of agree neither of them really even tastes like doritos though that's the funny thing none of them are really bad this is supposed to be nacho cheese flavored but to me this tastes more nacho cheese flavor i agree so who's really the winner burritos win at being doritos nacho cheese being nacho cheese is not nacho cheese that's the verdict now with that said you can also still enjoy a beautiful nacho cheese chip okay papa love you bye all right all right maybe not a precise winner here but do you want to know what else is as good as powdered cheese [Music] b-roll all right guys and that is it so we made sort of a burrito but more like we just made a nacho cheese chip that was really good it's this is a weird one you know we're starting off our first snack butt better and it's not i don't know that i would say that it's better it's just so different and and no i'm not taking this as an l because it's just extremely different okay people are probably going to be in the comments like oh you know you get a rematch creepy cream in doritos well i will be doing that i will but if you want an amazing homemade nacho cheese chip that is made completely from scratch this is the way to go dude all right you want to do this one i think that we win the game of making a nacho cheese chip but making a dorito i just don't know what their secret dorito spice is but we got pretty dang close so whether you make these doritos or not i hope you enjoyed the journey and i hope it gets you thinking about all is possible just with a little bit of time effort and love i think that i had a little more time to develop this we would have had a spot on one so there may be a little bit of a rematch in the future but for the time being if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave

Call it Cuatro Leches.

Also, don't...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, let's set the record straight okay you got cake and then you got tres leches totally different ball game [Music] so if it's not already obvious considering we've the title and okay it's obvious and i just want to say a couple things first off it's not that trust chase is necessarily better than any other cake i'm not necessarily saying that it's just always good it's a foolproof kind of cake you know one of the most difficult parts about making a great cake is keeping it moist don't at me about the word moisture and i'm not dealing with that but a tressler chase is literally soaked in three different kinds of well milk and so even if the cake is a little overcooked by then soaking it with this liquid it it's moist one way or another you're gonna have a great moist cake it's completely foolproof anybody can do it and make it perfectly so with all that said let's do this shall we to kick off our cake of many milks we'll start with the actual cake portion which is essentially a sponge cake start by cracking six eggs into a medium sized bowl and once all those beauties are cracked separate the yolks into a medium largish bowl now i put mine in the bowl of a stand mixer and put it in the stand mixer yeah well it didn't really work out so well but anyway using a hand blender beat your yolks on high speed and slowly add in three quarters of a cup or 165 grams of granulated sugar gradually until all the sugar is added and it's light and beautiful then beat in three quarters of a teaspoon or two grams of vanilla extract and half a cup or 120 milliliters of whole milk be till thoroughly combined now separately with your egg whites you're then going to beat those together on high speed as well until they begin to turn a little frothy then while continuously beating add a quarter cup or 55 grams of granulated sugar in batches not all at once until all the sugar is added and keep beating until you get some nice medium stiff peaks fold those two mixtures together until you get a nice homogenized pale yellow now separately you're gonna whisk together one and a half cups or 225 grams of all-purpose flour along with half a teaspoon or three grams of fine sea salt and one and a half teaspoons or seven grams of baking powder give that some whiskey business until thoroughly combined add your flour mixture to your fluffy mixture and fold together until thoroughly combined and you have a beautiful sponge cake batter prepare a 9x13 baking pan by spraying the absolute piss out of it with a non-stick cooking spray or you can use a butter stick whatever you feel pour your sponge cake batter into your prepared pan and toss it in the oven at 350 degrees fahrenheit not gonna do it today we're not gonna do it we're done doing that or 175 degrees celsius for 25 to 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean now it should look like this you know you don't want too much browning and you don't want to overbake it too much but it should be nice and spunky now place it to the side and let it cool completely fresh let chase literally translates to three milks which would be in the form of evaporated milk sweetened condensed milk and heavy cream now we're not gonna make the heavy cream but you can absolutely make your own evaporated milk and sweetened condensed milk the evaporated milk is actually really easy just take three and a half cups or 820 milliliters of whole milk put that in a medium-sized sauce pot place it on the stove and lightly simmer it stirring occasionally for 25 minutes or until reduced to about one and a half cups or 350 milliliters and that's well that's evaporated milk you don't gonna evaporated it now if you want to know how to make the sweetened condensed milk you can actually get that from my pumpkin pie recipe or you could just use a 14 ounce can once you've got that all put together get a medium sized bowl and add 14 ounces or 400 milliliters of sweetened condensed milk 12 ounces or 350 milliliters of evaporated milk one vanilla bean worth of beans that's optional and half a cup or 120 milliliters of heavy cream whisk that together until thoroughly combined grab your cooled sponge cake get a fork prick the entire cake with your fork look no funny business with the jokes here all right try not to rip the cake up when you're doing this by the way then pour your triple milkmaid mixture on top of your sponge cake all of it okay don't get skimpy here cover it with plastic wrap and place it in the fridge for at least one hour and ideally overnight now you'd be surprised this actually does all get soaked up within one hour but it does take overnight for it to evenly disperse now while that's going we all know about the tres leches right there's three but what if we introduced a fourth in the form of dulce de leche to make that it's also extremely easy in a medium-sized sauce pot combine four cups or one liter of whole milk and one and a quarter cup or 270 grams of granulated sugar mix that together place it on your stove set it over medium low heat let that sugar dissolve and as soon as it comes to a simmer reduce the heat to medium low and let that gently simmer and reduce while stirring often for about one and a half hours yes i know it's a long time or until thickened in a nice deep brown look this kind of stuff takes time right you're literally making caramelized milk and also yeah don't let it burn once that's done take it off the stove and let it cool to room temperature pull your fully moisturized cake from the fridge add a generous amount of your dulce de leche on top you're not going to use all of it all right whatever you don't use just save it trust me you're going to be happy that you did then spread that evenly all over the top of the cake and separately you're going to whip one cup or 240 milliliters of heavy cream with one tablespoon of granulated sugar and just keep beating and beating kind of like you do all of your problems when you beat it deep down into yourself that's a joke until you get a beautiful fluffy whipped cream then spread all of your whipped cream on top of your soaked tressled chase cake gently sprinkle some ground cinnamon all over the top of your cake don't go too hard here make sure you go light and you're ready to serve make sure to serve this bad boy ice cold take a nice sharp knife and cut it into 12 even squares pull your cake out plate it up and optionally you can add some macerated strawberries which are literally just strawberries that have been sliced tossed in a few tablespoons of sugar you let them sit for like a minute or two until the juices come out spoon it on top dig in and enjoy the moistiest cakeiest cake of your life why do i look like a founding father the founding father have a nut sack on the back of their head though i don't think so so we have tristala chase three three that's how many milks are in well technically there's actually a lot of different milks in this this is like five leches what is five in spanish hey alexa what's five in spanish thank you it's cinco nevermind [Music] cinco leches we've got heavy cream sweet condensed milk evaporated milk dulce de leche on top and milk powder it's moist it's beautiful it's uh it's nice and oddly square first off listen looks good wow this has to be one of the best cakes we've ever made on this channel this is i can't even formulate words the milk has overtaken me i am the milkman i am mommy milky only like a hundred people out of however many people watch this are gonna know what i'm talking about when i say mommy milky this is big mommy milky so the thing that's great about this is it's not like overly wet it's just like perfectly moist god i can't get away from it how do i describe this without sounding too sexy the three milks that are in this are five milks if you want to go that far they all kind of collectively instead of creating just this like soggy cake what you really get is it still has structural integrity it's got texture and yet it's perfectly moist and when you bite into it you've got that like sweetness it's creamy the vanilla bean i don't know that i would go as far to say this is the most traditional tres leches of all time but i would say this is probably one of the greatest that i've ever put in my mouth period i said that so loud the air conditioner turned off but do you want to know what else is incredibly moist get your mind out of the gutter you nasty b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made tres leches cake first thing notice how my hair is down i not in case you in case you didn't already notice that i don't normally do that because it gets really hot i'm already sweating you're welcome yeah tasting my trustlet cheesecake i really feel like this is one of the best ones i've ever had this one hit so heavy it was so good it was so satisfying it's honestly a perfect cake to serve during the summer or in the winter but now that it's hot you know you've got this like it's like a juicy juicy in the best way yeah you guys know how i feel about some nice juicy cake in the morning all right like i said before this is a foolproof recipe and i really think this is one of those recipes that literally anybody can make and it is just about impossible to mess it up quick note i'm working on a lot of different incredible amazing mind-boggling things that are only made possible by you guys it's been a while since i've said this and i just want to say again from the bottom of my heart thank you guys for all the opportunities that i'm provided because of you because of your support because of everybody you know collectively coming together and appreciating what i do and it means a lot to me and i'm constantly trying to get back to you guys and so there's a lot of projects i'm working on that are specifically made for you just as all this stuff is we've got a really big deal in the works uh kind of taking taking me aback just to see like how far we've come in such a short period of time now we're working on stuff that to me could technically revolutionize a couple different industries and you know i don't want to over hype it but you know it's it's pretty amazing and so that's coming soon so you know without revealing too much it's coming we'll be talking about it very soon let's just say that it'll be in the form of uh one of these yeah an apron right completely different than you could possibly imagine i can promise you that now with all that said if you enjoyed

I'm talking homemade tortillas, beautifully marinated chicken, and perfect rice. Once everything is said and...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, the past two months have been the craziest of my entire life and now you're asking me to take out my precious chipotle all right [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so welcome back to butt better we're doing chipotle burritos today i didn't know if i was ever gonna do this one because well two reasons for one i actually like chipotle i do eat there and it's hard for me to be like let me make this better but also at the same time my ego says do it josh do it don't you ever shy away from the challenge brother and naturally i'm like why do you have that accent but also okay recently this is the most highly requested butt better i have seen in my dms on instagram and tick tock and all my social platforms by the way if you have any others that you want to see be sure to comment in the comments section yes let's do this shall we we're in root chipotle it's ahead of us i don't know if i can go in okay i'm gonna try and if they yell at me then um i don't know all right we have stinky burritos so we've got the bag you know great branding and they try to source their stuff well when you eat a burrito i see people unwrapping them and just eating the burrito as it no unwrap it like a banana who in public is gonna unwrap a whole banana and then eat it that first off weird it's a little bit messy they left this tomato on here i'm gonna dock points for that this is for you chipotle chicken's actually this is one of the few times under season the rice itself has too much lime juice it's acidic so it feels like i'm just eating a mouthful of vinegary rice this is actually kind of a shock to me because usually chipotle does well we respect chipotle around here this was not the time to not be ready chipotle let's first start off by marinating our chicken obviously the name is chipotle therefore we'll have chipotles in the marinade but begin with two dried guajillo chilies and two dried ancho chilies pull off their tops and de-seed them then place their skins into a bowl along with four to six dried mushrooms of your choice these are dried oyster mushrooms then pour one and a half cups or 350 milliliters of boiling water on top of your chilies and mushrooms and cover with plastic wrap to let them steep and soften now all those guys are sitting in the hot springs of flavor town you're also going to take a small dry pan toss in 2 teaspoons or 4 grams of coriander seeds and 2 teaspoons or 4 grams of cumin seeds set that over medium heat shaking the pan often until fragrant and beautifully toasted about a minute or two now toss those into a blender and blend on high speed until you get a nice fine powder then to that add your rehydrated chilies and mushrooms along with about half of your soaking liquid one seven ounce can of chipotle peppers in adobo one teaspoon or three grams of ground cinnamon two teaspoons or 12 grams of kosher salt the juice of one lime now just begin blending that and let it blend until completely smooth now if it's struggling to blend just add a little bit of your chili soaking liquid until it loosens properly now while that's vortexing and blending you're then going to stream in 4 tablespoons or 60 milliliters of oil now i'm using chili oil because duh flavor but if you don't have that you can just use a neutrally flavored oil such as canola let that continue blending until all the oil is emulsified you have a nice smooth beautiful chili marinade then take one and a half pounds or 680 grams of boneless skinless chicken thighs left whole pour your marinade on top toss them all together cover with plastic wrap and then just let that marinate in the fridge for at least one hour or overnight okay let's talk homemade tortillas you know to be completely honest with you i always thought that lard was the key or shortening was the key to great tortillas it turns out if you really want a truly chewy tortilla you need to use vegetable oil otherwise they're going to be way too soft any liquid fat really it's a very simple process you're going to need 2 cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon or 4 grams of kosher salt a half teaspoon or 2 grams of baking powder then give that some whiskey business until thoroughly combined now while mixing with a fork you're gonna add three quarters of a cup or 180 milliliters of hot water immediately followed by a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of vegetable oil mix that all together with your fork until it begins to come together as a nice beautiful little dough dump it out onto a work surface and begin kneading by hand until it comes together into a nice beautiful smooth dough now by hand this should take about three to five minutes once that's done cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest for one to two hours gotta let that gluten relax let it just have some time to itself you know take care of your tortilla dough as you should be taking care of yourself are you loving yourself are you giving yourself care and attention welcome to the mirror take a look and give kiss don't forget that papa is always here for you chicken is marinating tortilla dough is resting let's make our beans start with four to five strips of smoky bacon i'm using benton's which is like ultra ultra smoky cut those into half inch segments place them in a 12 inch skillet set over medium heat and begin cooking them stirring them often letting their fat release until they get nice and crispy now remove the bacon leaving the bacon fat behind and add one yellow onion that's been very thinly sliced season lightly with salt then cook that over medium heat tossing occasionally until it begins to get nice and soft then add four cloves of garlic saute that until fragrant then add one large jalapeno that's been very thinly sliced and just let that cook for about 30 seconds i don't like to cook my jalapenos a ton i like that sort of fresh chili taste so that's up to you then follow that up with one can of drained black beans a half cup or 120 milliliters of chicken stock bring that up to heat and let that simmer until almost all the chicken stock has reduced about 85 percent of it or so remove it from the heat and stir in two tablespoons or 24 grams of unsalted butter until completely melted and emulsified and you have the most smokiest baconiest black beans now we got one more element to look at here and that is the rice as most cultures will tell you rice is very important all right and this is coming from a white boy now look for this recipe you're gonna need four cups of cooked rice you'll need about two cups of a dry medium grain rice make sure to rinse it twice okay so we've got a strainer set over a bowl we fill the bowl up with water we agitate that a little bit we pull it out we drain it and we do that one more time so the rice rinses the starch off i don't know why i was talking like smeagol talks to himself but yeah now if you really want to properly cook rice you got to get rid of that pot all right let's be honest you need to cook it in a rice cooker if you want absolutely perfect rice now if you are using a rice cooker such as this zojirushi add your rice in add equal parts water so two cups of dry rice two cups of water turn it on press the button let it cook and you got beautifully cooked rice just like that now you can cook your rice however you want but once you have four cups of cooked rice place your hot cooked rice into a bowl now to that you're gonna add the zest of one lime and the zest of one lemon a half cup of finely chopped fresh cilantro the juice of two limes two tablespoons or 24 grams of unsalted butter and a generous amount of salt to taste stir all that together until thoroughly combined and that is your cilantro lime rice now for the chicken it's really really basic heat a large pan with enough oil to coat the bottom over medium-high heat and cook that chicken in the pan flipping often until you have a beautifully browned outside and the chicken is completely and totally cooked and registered 165 degrees internal temperature now the way that i actually like to do it is to sear the chicken on both sides just to get color and then just toss it on a sheet tray and throw it in an oven set to 400 degrees fahrenheit until it's completely cooked through to me this is the best way because you can get the color and then just ensure that it's cooked all the way through now let's finish off those tortillas so to do that divide your dough into about six even pieces roll each of those pieces into a big ball we've been making a lot of balls in the show recently hmm now take each ball individually generously flour your work surface and flour your ball pat it down until it's flat then using a rolling pin you're gonna roll that beautiful thing out and ideally you want it to reach around 12 inches in diameter and as circular as you can get it of course now separately get yourself a 12 inch cast iron pan or a comal if you have one and preheat that over medium high heat on your stove top and once that's nice and ripping hot take your raw tortilla that you've just shaped gently and carefully lay it down into your ripping hot pan let it cook and bubble up for about 15 to 30 seconds or until the bottom becomes lightly charred flip and repeat on the other side and immediately remove from the hot pan and place on a plate covered with towels then rinse and repeat with the rest of your tortillas i personally like to shape them one at a time as i cook them but you know you can shape them all and then cook them all it's up to you just don't let the dough dry out please once everything's said and done you should have a bunch of beautiful looking blistery lightly charred flower tortillas we have our elements now we just need to wrap them in our tortilla blanket take your chicken and cut it into bite-sized pieces lay your tortilla down and look we're gonna do this just like they do on the line at chipotle first a nice little layer of rice don't be overzealous here okay make sure you have the wrapping skills to handle your filling followed by your beans then your chicken a nice little healthy layer some diced tomato some beautifully sliced avocado obviously hit that bad boy with some flaky salt if you a real one a nice healthy layer of aged manchego cheese like really really nice and healthy layer you know say i'll like it a little bit of cotija cheese then muster up your best burrito wrapping skills that you possibly can i've never been stellar at wrapping burritos to be honest with you i really tried to study the chipotle line cook when i was there all right anyway roll that bad boy up nice and tight and let's get ourselves a little cross section we're gonna take our knife cut through the center gently and lovingly twist turn and that looks like a beautiful burrito to me now we shall taste test that's what i love about this series we all come together bring all these ingredients and we layer and we layer and we layer and each layer gives us the most tender love and care that it deserves the tortilla the salsa i forgot to put salsa vikram will you get the salsa now we add salsa salsa optional this is the jalapeno salsa uh same one that is made for a lot of the ones that i've ever done tacos i also made it to my quesadilla it's time oh i thought this was gonna go all the way on my head wow the whoa i can't even talk this is so good the first bite your mouth almost doesn't even believe your brain all the flavors start coming out the whole avocado far surpasses the texture of guac and a burrito chipotle is not authentic mexican and i wouldn't necessarily say minus either but mine is definitely closer so if we're looking at authentic maximized flavor at every single level we won we need to bring in someone taste test got somebody new for you tj i need you to enter the arena burrito number one force it in there okay i'll let you uh masticate for a little bit okay that tasted almost like a curry i see that there are some similar curry flavors in there yeah that was really good okay and then number two i'm gonna place in your hands i like how he holds them out like it's a baby coming up it's a communion it's a communion wise they're completely different this one has almost kind of like a umami kind of asian taste to it i want to say almost like a japanese taste it's hard to go with it but i'm honestly going to go with that first one there it is folks you heard it here that's the winner baby all right we heard it number one matters me we win again but better episode i don't know anymore it's not even gonna happen i don't know but we won yeah but do you want to know what else has chunky burrito vibes [Music] b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made the chipotle burrito let's take a step back for a second and listen carefully listen very carefully making this from scratch has a multitude of layers experientially that's a word in my opinion define it as better of course we're gonna get the comments like well i can just get a chipotle and pick up my own burrito yeah obviously thank you good job commenter commenter of the of the month everybody let's get a round of applause good job you could go to chipotle yeah why do you think this series exists of course anyway making your own tortillas flavored texture better period end of story the actual layering of flavors is much more distinguished it's a better experience it's a better burrito it's more fun so don't even say that to me but they come through the screen and pinch your little cheeks and when papa pinches your cheeks it ain't gonna feel good maybe a little but anyway if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a

Frozen Custard and ice cream are the sweet frosty dessert that we all crave at home. Just a few very simple...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, now people might be wondering what the heck does milwaukee have to offer other than a silly name milwaukeeans just playing but i have two words for you frozen custard better than you think [Music] okay so i'm not trying to drag milwaukee i'm simply saying that for some reason it's just not talked about enough which makes me kind of sad because it's the undisputed frozen custard capital of the world with more custard shops per capita than anywhere else it popularized frozen custard at the 1933's world fair an event comparable to the fictional stark expo but instead of killer robots they had uh frozen custard what's the difference between frozen custard and ice cream good question well let's just say it takes a killer combination to make it right but do you want to know what else makes an amazing combination bundling your home and car insurance obviously and that's where today's sponsor geico comes in sure like ice cream car insurance is great by itself but if you add home insurance the egg yolks in our flawless analogy you'll end up with a concoction that's greater than the sum of its parts in every way because combining your home and car insurance could save you even more for bundling made easy visit geico.com today and of course you can head to the description to get a quote and find out how much you could save i'm just trying to keep you safe okay i'm just trying we're just trying to help you out okay so with all that said let's do this shall we okay so first thing for frozen custard is well maybe not putting your face in the pot sorry for how i am what you should actually do is get a medium sized sauce pot and add two and a quarter cup or 530 milliliters of heavy cream one cup or 240 milliliters of whole milk two thirds of a cup plus two tablespoons or 175 grams of granulated sugar that was a mouthful and half a teaspoon or three grams of kosher salt lastly you're going to add the bean scrape from one vanilla bean pod one vanilla bean pod then go ahead and toss the whole pot in too why not we can go fishing for it lighter now toss that there pot onto the stove set it to medium heat and stir occasionally until very hot and steamy and the sugar is dissolved ideally about 175 degrees fahrenheit or 80 degrees celsius no boiling or simmering at any point if you boil this not only will i be very angry but you'll also ruin your ice cream so you don't want either of those things whilst you're heating your milky cream mixture go ahead and separate out seven egg yolks in a medium sized bowl i like to crack them all into one bowl and then pull the yolks out by hand just a little bit easier this way it's a westawatt technique now once your milk mixture is at temperature ladle and whisk in a splash of your hot milk into the egg yolks whisk until combined then repeat a couple more times until your egg yolks are nice and hot then pour that yolk mixture back into the pot and continue to heat adjusting it back and forth from medium to low to maintain that 175 while stirring constantly until that mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon beautifully about 15 minutes now if it curdles or the egg yolk cooks you went too dang hot that's all i gotta say to you now straighten your mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl and set it over an ice bath then just stir until it's completely cold now from this point all you gotta do is turn it in an ice cream maker according to the ice cream maker's directions look i don't like doing the whole freezing the base for 24 hours so i use an ice cream maker with a compressor that's not a flex i'm just saying use any ice cream maker that your budget allows now if you're like me and you prefer frozen custard in a soft serve form i have a way for you to do it without a 5 000 soft serve machine instead of placing your ice cream in the freezer to firm up to scoop simply take the ice cream straight from your ice cream maker place it in a piping bag with a star design tip and pipe it into the cone of your choice and bang now you have your own soft-serve frozen custard it's pretty much the same thing maybe not exactly but pretty close to make your own waffle cone you're gonna need a waffle cone maker sorry about it preheat that there waffle cone micro now to make your waffle cone batter start by mixing together two egg whites until nice and frothy then whisk in a quarter cup or 65 grams of heavy cream two teaspoons or nine grams of vanilla extract half a cup or 115 grams of granulated sugar then while constantly whisking slowly streaming a quarter cup or 56 grams of unsalted melted butter once that's all mixed together and emulsified finally sift in 2 3 of a cup or 100 grams of all-purpose flour until you decide that sifting it takes too long and it's boring so just pour it all in then whisk it all together until thoroughly combined you've got a beautiful waffle batter now at this point your waffle iron should be nice and preheated go ahead and grease it lightly with some oil you can use spray that's easier than this then go ahead and toss in a quarter cup of your batter and cook it for about two minutes then burn it a couple times because this thing gets hotter than you expect whoops okay maybe more like one minute just keep your eyes on until it's a lovely golden brown okay maybe i should have gotten a better machine pull the waffles out of the hot iron and onto a clean dry towel then using a cone shaper which should have been included with your machine tightly wrap it around the cone while it's still pliable and hold it together until it can hold its own shape then just let it cool standing up in a glass until crispy and crunchy now all you gotta do is scoop your lovely frozen custard or pipe it if you wish then admire its beauty and don't forget to lick your fingies when you're done this is a very basic frozen custard it's just cream sugar milk eggs vanilla wow well first off let me just say that this is very good this is not like a typical soft serve you know this is the real deal in terms of texture flavor it's rich it's creamy the one that kind of wanted to cover was um anybody who bites their ice cream it's okay if you lip it notice how i'm lipping it i'm not biting it i'm scooping it with my upper lip but if you bite your ice cream what is wrong with you what are you doing frozen custard similar to ice cream yet somehow better maybe no i don't know you need a basic ice cream machine to do this it doesn't have to be as bougie as mine but you can have soft serve just a piping bag bro that is how i want all frozen custard to be at home okay thank you bye but do you want to know what else is creamy and delicious don't answer that b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it thanks again to my friends at geico for sponsoring this video they're helping me with my culinary journey around the united states and they want to help you too not so much with food but by saving you money on your home and car insurance which is uh important too so like i said before head down to that link below and visit geico.com today so what we did today was frozen custard but it's also kind of a soft serve at the same time now could you freeze it and scoop it of course you can there's nothing wrong with that i won't judge you at all because you still made it and i'm still proud of you for that frozen custard and ice cream is very different and i think that this recipe exudes the essence of what our frozen custard should be it's not complicated it's simple it's rich it's smooth it's frozen yeah that's the cute name that i thought of it i don't know okay so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like

The real goal here is just using some very basic technique and you'll have arguably...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, ah yes the most common thing i hear oh healthy food is expensive and it doesn't taste good no i think it's time that we come back to this thought and change [Music] okay so we'll come back to episode two up but no three why can't i never remember this i don't remember people's names numbers i don't know the months in order that's actually true i'm ashamed of it this is the first time i'm saying it and i can't wait to get made fun of now people are gonna call me like hey josh you know what comes after february and i'm like no it's march right things that are healthy has this stigma of like i said being expensive and being not very tasty and it's just not true something being healthy can be perfectly affordable and perfectly delicious you just gotta understand what to do gotta use that old noggin the whole point of this series is there's no trick it's just understanding technique so without giving it all away let's make this shall we so despite the fact that i normally don't eat breakfast we're gonna start with a new style breakfast by making shakshuka gonna start off by dicing one red bell pepper and thinly slicing one sweet onion obviously peeled in a large saucepan toss in three tablespoons or 42 grams of unsalted butter and once that's hot and bubbling go ahead and add your bell pepper and your onions along with four cloves of garlic which i forgot to add when i was filming this so just let's pretend that that's in there all right thank you season that lightly with salt and pepper salt helps that water draw out of there so it cooks a little faster now cook that over medium heat just until the vegetables begin to soften then add 1 teaspoon or 2 grams of cumin 1 teaspoon or 2 grams of sweet paprika and half a teaspoon or 1 gram of cayenne powder just let that saute until the spices become nice and fragrant then add 1 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes stir that together scraping the bottom of the pan now just bring that up to a cauldron bubbling simmer make little indentions and crack in six whole eggs be careful not to break the yolk or you want that runny boy then just pop that into an oven that's been preheated to 375 degrees fahrenheit or 190 degrees celsius for seven to ten minutes or just until the eggs are set pull that bad boy out and optionally you can garnish it with a little bit of feta and cilantro which will tack on another dollar to the total of this shakshuka is great on its own but i personally like it on a nice piece of toast you can use whole grain toast or if you're trying to get ultra shreddy freddy and you can put it on vegetables and it's great like that too which puts you at around six to seven dollars for two to three servings of food totaling out at three dollars per serving next up is peanutty pork yeah maybe we work on the name first we're going to make a little stir-fry sauce in a small bowl mix together a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of soy sauce 2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters of rice vinegar or regular 1 teaspoon or 6 grams of granulated sugar and well you know this is where i would say five cloves of garlic but for some reason i keep this is this is i bought this as normal garlic and it just came with like this i don't know what yeah anyway grate that and then a two inch knob of ginger also grated mix that together and add two and a half teaspoons or seven grams of corn starch mix that in and your sauce now let's talk about pork so here i have one pound of value cut pork chops but you can kind of use whatever you want whatever's in your budget then just cut those into half-inch little cubes preheat a large skillet with two tablespoons or 28 grams of neutral tasting oil over medium-high heat once that's ripping hot add in your pork and let that sear for about two to three minutes before tossing to get that nice golden brown color take that out of the pan then add four diced ribs of celery and one bunch of green onions sliced and constantly stir and cook over medium-high heat aka stir fry just until it begins to soften and generate a little bit of color then you're gonna add in one fresno or serrano chili that's been very finely chopped and if you want to know how i do that basically i cut off the top cut around the inside to cut out that membrane and all the seeds and then lay it out flat slice it into very thin strips as evenly in size as possible then turn those strips and cut them across to get tiny little cubes now that's the way i like to do it lots of people do it differently don't be mad at me if it's not how you do it all right go go yell into a pillow or something i don't know anyway add your chili let that saute for about a minute add your pork back to the pan make sure your fire alarm goes off that helps a lot with the flavor development it's really a necessity to the process in my opinion finish that off with your stir fry sauce let it cook for just a few seconds until it thickens stirring constantly take it off the heat and then add in about a third of a cup or 55 grams of roasted peanuts that have been roughly chopped now all there's left to do is spoon it into a bowl along with some steamed rice or you can absolutely use cauliflower rice if you're watching your carbs whatever you know i don't know i don't know your thing white rice is my weakness so i will absolutely eat 45 000 cups of it within any given second now with the total cost of this being around seven dollars and the fact that it serves two to four people that puts you around two to four dollars per serving last but not least it's dinner time so we're gonna make some glazed meatballs stir with a small saucepan and to that you're gonna add three quarters of a cup or 190 grams of ketchup two tablespoons or 35 grams of honey two tablespoons or 30 milliliters of soy sauce and three tablespoons or 45 milliliters of the sauce that nobody knows how to pronounce were chester science thought yes give that a little mix place it on your stove top over medium heat bring it to a simmer and let it simmer for about two to five minutes or until lightly reduced that's it that's your glaze now to make your meatballs you're gonna need one pound of ground chicken along with three cloves of finely chopped garlic 2 thinly sliced green onions and 1 small beaten egg season them to taste with salt and pepper if you desire i mean we all have desires mix that together until thoroughly combined and then with wet hands you're going to take that ground meat and form it into 12 evenly sized balls not i'm resisting to make any ball jokes all right no ball joke place this on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and toss it in an oven set to 450 degrees fahrenheit or 230 degrees celsius for about 15 to 18 minutes or until all the way done now all those are going we're gonna make a little charred kale salad and look i hate kale and this is the only way that i can enjoy it so first strip one bunch of kale of its leaves hit a large skillet with just enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan over medium high heat until ripping ripping hot toss your kale in batches and just lightly char we're not looking to cook it all away just get some nice char all over each leaf now once it's charred you're then going to add two to three cloves of garlic grated into the pan turn off the heat season it in a taste with salt hit it with some lemon or lime juice quickly stir it and then immediately remove from the heat and place in a bowl now from here you can adjust the seasoning with salt and lime juice as you desire but the whole point is you don't want to cook the garlic all the way through you want it a little bit raw a little bit still spicy now at this point your chicken meatballs should be done pull them out give them a generous brushing of your glaze and then place them back in the oven under the broiler for just a couple minutes until they get nice and sticky and a little bubbly like so now to serve this it's very simple get a nice little plate optionally you can put a little smear of yogurt or sour cream or any sort of like creamy tangy little thang along with your meatballs and your chard kale salad and that's a beautiful way to end the night now the grand total of this comes up to seven dollars and forty four cents and with it serving two to four people that puts it at two to four dollars per serving hot dog is a glizzy meatball is a gap cat meatball 20 20. let's go we got a breakfast we got a lunch and we got wait no breakfast lunch din din this is this many calories this is this many calories and this is that many calories why am i saying it like that why am i using that language that's because i haven't calculated it yet so pray for me that it is in a safe zone so a lot of you don't know this about me but when i was about 16 and this is not going to be a sob story but when i was about 16 i lost over 100 pounds so i know a little bit about dieting and i can tell you that all this stuff falls into a pretty safe category whether you're dieting or you just want to eat foods that are better for you this is a fine dining start shakshuka you've got the soft egg runny yolk ideally assuming you don't let it sit like i did the sauce is a little spicy we've got some sweetness a little bit of tartness the crunch of the toast great for summer or it's great for winter it's hearty yet this is like a standard takeout when you eat this you're gonna be taken back to all the moments you've ever gotten chinese takeout eat it it envelops you this despite that it doesn't come with all the like unhealthy things that you typically would have in there it's lower calorie blah blah blah blah not that we care about calories maybe you do flavor now chicken meatball right that doesn't sound very nice no no it doesn't yet they've been sitting for a little bit we've got this sort of like beautiful almost barbecued glaze and a stark white juicy inside a little bit of yogurt oh wow that is so much better with the yogurt some unsuspecting bystander at your dining table they're going to see this and go oh it looks all right i don't know how i feel about chicken meatballs they're going to put in their mouth and they're going to be like because it's so good they'll be electrified to say the least let's talk about the kale fiasco i hate kale more than anything this is the only way that i can eat it right when you char it like this you get rid of that bitter quality it's nice it's got some new smoky notes to it smells like you came fresh off the barbecue it's tooth some still it's tart garlicky this is the only way i will ever eat kale and if you don't like kale this is your way to save yourself anyway all this stuff collectively comes together at this price in this calorie level this is the ultimatum of healthy meals but cheaper yeah but do you want to know what else is healthy yet beautiful b-roll [Music] so we made a breakfast a lunch and a dinner this is just the first of many i want to explore this topic a little more but i want to hear what you guys have to say about it so if there's something in particular you want to see on but cheaper or something healthy that you want to see and combine with that whatever these are two subjects that are very important to me a lot of people need help with this and i have the information but i want to know exactly what you want so let me know in the comments below i mean that's really it it's healthy meals and they're affordable and they see me this goes to show that with a little bit of care and a little bit of technique there isn't really a difference between something that is healthy and flavorful and expensive it's really just comes down to your own creativity that's all that matters papa love you so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see

Breakfast taco video (includes salsa and tortilla recipe): https://youtu.be/j0gjlSg...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, okay so there are many ways to make a quesadilla right is there a wrong way is there a right way or maybe there's the best way [Music] okay so today we're gonna be making quesadillas we're gonna talk about a bunch of different things right is homemade better or does it not make a difference to store-bought inevitably just it's just as good I don't know we're gonna find that out secondarily cheese end of story there and then we're gonna create multiple fillings we're really working to try and make the perfect quesadilla but at the end that is kind of a subjective look let me not shoot myself on the foot and let's make this shall we now hold on there partner you can't just go and make a quesadilla salsa and tortillas are the first thing we need to look at before assembling our cheesy majesty both full recipes for the homemade tortillas in the salsa can be found in my breakfast taco video which will be linked below but for some context you can make any ordinary salsa you want but I like to make a nice little roasted jalapeno salsa which I make by simply blackening some jalapenos letting them steam in some foil peeling them and then finally blending them along with some roasted garlic oil and roasted garlic and all sorts of other stuff but again the full recipe can be found on the link below now moving forward let's see if a homemade tortilla is even worth the work I made these tortillas using a mix of bacon fat and shortening as my fat of choice then I rolled them out by hand and cooked them individually leaving us with some beautifully truly artisan looking and tasting tortillas next to the pre-made tortilla I really think mine look better is you know it my ego has taken me to a point where I always think mine always looks better but besides that let's just talk about cheese you can use any cheese that melts nicely I know that cheese choice tends to be a religion for most people but I really enjoyed this mix of medium sharp cheddar Gruyere Monterey Jack and smoked cheddar I prefer mixes of cheese is only because you get different melting qualities plus different flavors I'm a complicated man once all is grated toss together till well combined by the way that's equal parts of all these different cheeses now so we could get a non crowded example for the homemade versus 'im premade tortilla let's do a plain cheese quesadilla for each grab your hurricane tour Atilla fill half of it with your desired amount of cheese what my mom has taught me the way of excess cheese so I preferred extra thick II get a small container of unsalted butter about 6 tablespoons or 84 grams melt it well the other half over Russia generously with your melted butter and invert into a cold pan so the butter side is down we'll repeat that process with the homemade tortilla and also by the way notice how beautifully these snuggle in a 12 inch pan now just pop this bad boy on the stove over a medium heat to get a nice golden brown and the cheese begins to melt about two to three minutes then buttered the top I got two buttered sides see where we're going here then flip each of them carefully and let that toast and cook another two to three minutes or until golden brown and the cheese is completely melted remove it from the pan slice into four pieces each respect and admire the cheese Pole and now it's time to determine the torte illa winner okay so we have two different options here also motorcycle guys in here but guess what we got a new guy new guy enters the arena leaf blower guy we got the homemade and then we got the pre-made right they both look delicious this one looks a little more delicate and flaky let's mm-hmm so it is almost like combined with vitor TN and this one there's still a little melty they're both very good honestly you're not gonna be disappointed with a pre-made tortilla now with that said the benefits of having a homemade one is a fresh flavor it's homemade more delicate pre-made little chewier of sweet and it has like this weird aftertaste it's not really clear winner vikrum is gonna come say hello Dale Oh mmm getting the idea of like whether you think it's worth it make your own I think it's a matter of experience this one is like you have that homemade kind of textured feel this one's definitely there's like chewy soft I think it's just a matter of preference I've got an American palate we'll probably want this one more now if you have a more refined palate this might be your route okay so we understand the classic cheese let's look at a more beefy brethren of that so with one whole onion thinly sliced also before that make sure to do this with it of course then immediately become self-conscious cuz your knife is dull then heat a ten-inch kill it up with about three tablespoons or 42 grams of canola oil or any high heat cooking oil over medium-high heat once it's nice and hot toss in your sliced onion season to taste with salt and begin cooking it while stirring often then simply continue this process until the onions have softened and begin to generate some nice color it's cool they char a wee bit that'll take about five to eight minutes then add three and a half tablespoons or fifty milliliters of a good balsamic vinegar then just let that reduce until it turns into a bit of a glaze about two to three minutes turn off the heat and add one teaspoon or five grams of honey stir that together and you've got some sweet and sour onions from there you'll need some format of beef I have been half of this beautiful little sirloin cap also known as a picanha but you can use any steak that you like I scored the fat cap on it just but render out a bit while it's cooking season it generously with salt and pepper and preheat a skillet with enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan over medium-high heat until it lipping hot and sear it for about two to three minutes per side until you get a nice medium-rare which would be pulled at around 130 degrees Fahrenheit now optionally you can base it in butter once it's done cooking but you know this what I decided not to for some on reason which I hate no all you gotta do is chase up tor Atilla lap before at a meaty layer of meat followed by your sweet and sour onions fold it up brush with melted butter and cook the same as before leaving with a nice and beefed-up version of a quesadilla last but not least I have something for the vegetarians here yes you're welcome papa love you too now heat a 10-inch skillet with a couple tablespoons of olive oil heated over medium heat until very hot then add six sliced trumpet mushrooms which is equal to around 10 button mushrooms season those to taste with salt and let those cook for about 2 minutes before agitating the pan then add 1 thinly sliced shallot saute that for a few seconds to then follow up with one thinly sliced zucchini season again with salt and pepper to taste and then continue cooking for about five minutes stirring occasionally until the veggies have softened up didn't get some light color then finish it with one thinly sliced red Fresno chili or really any chili of your choice and that's it that's your filling then just follow in the footsteps of the previous quesadilla first cheese then filling fold butter it up into that layer pan flip slice and enjoy we got beefy boy and vegetarian healthy well not really healthy but Jesus vegetarian right some cheese's aren't vegetarian well you can use cheese that's vegetarian ok but the beefy boy first cuz that's my choice if you're a beef chief you know first bite like fireworks beefy fireworks like flavor it is really rich though only thing that helps lift it are the caramelized onions they've got the sweetness and you've got that sort of acidity that you need to cut through that richness the vegetarian one I can eat a lot more of in the beef one it's light enough that after you eat it you don't feel like you need to go on like an 18 mile run after eating it you feel good the flavor still hits you like but in a more romantic way cheese choice meat or vegetarian it's all up to you and that's the pew of the quesadilla but you want to know what else is cheesy and magnificent b-roll or guys and that is it so we made quesadillas vegetarian homies Papa gives you love - alright I know you're always asking for it I'm doing what I can to get you - alright I'm done dude I'm doing what I can't I'm gonna kick at the end of the day it's kind of a subjective choice right what is the perfect quesadilla really the point is that whatever you like it's just understanding the general technique to get you there now it's up to you to use the knowledge that you've earned today go forth and become your own quesadilla King don't know what that means but if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and I will see you next

Enjoy my winning recipe to recreate the...,2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, so somebody told me josh this one's too easy for you gotta do something else but you know it's not always just about winning sometimes it's about making a [Music] [Applause] [Music] point [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so welcome back to but better episode number every single episode i forget so we're making subway meatball sandwiches now let me just quickly point something out here i believe technically if there's meatballs in a sub sandwich it's technically technically a hero so it's a meatball hero the the words meatball sandwich don't really roll off the tongue but when you do it properly in my opinion this is one of the greatest sub sandwiches on the planet so with all that said let's make this shall we i like how whenever you look up subway you're just surrounded by them this person grabs the bread rips it open rips like there's a piece of it like missing left it like that the the meatballs just get like thrown on tears the cheese throws the cheese on she's like you want to judge it puts it wraps it up and throws it in the bag i mean look at the way it's bent look at the way this is bent bag is so steamy why it's like a swamp eww my hand immediately becomes moist what is that people actually begged me not to do this recipe where's the cut mark is it here or is it here does it happen this is the appetizer nope it tastes like meatballs with hot salsa it is iconic it does taste the same as it always has but but look at this that's not right i think we should show them how it's done let's start with our bread get the bowl of a stand mixer or a regular bowl people are always complaining josh not everyone has a stand mixer yeah okay use your hands pal and add three and a half cups or 500 grams of all-purpose flour do a flip to celebrate not spilling any flour 1 tablespoon or 13 grams of granulated sugar and 2 teaspoons or 5 grams of fine sea salt give that some whiskey bits until thoroughly combined now from here you're going to add 2 tablespoons or 30 grams of room temperature lard bacon fat or shortening obviously bacon fat would 120 slap then using two forks blend that into the flour to get fine little crumbs in there separately you're gonna get one and a quarter cup or 295 milliliters of warm water at around 100 degrees fahrenheit and you're gonna mix in one tablespoon or 10 grams of instant yeast now assuming you know that your yeast is live you don't need to let it sit pop your dough onto your sand mixer with the dough hook attachment begin mixing on medium low speed add your yeasty boys to your flour mixture then just let it do its thing mix that until it forms a nice beautiful dough after that well just let it keep mixing and kneading the dough for about three to five minutes or until it's nice and smooth once you get a smooth chunky little man gently form that into a nice top ball plop it in a lightly greased bowl cover with plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature for one hour or until doubled this is very basic you guys have heard me say this a billion times now that your little man is all grown up punch him down lightly flour a work surface dump them out and then divide into two equal pieces to shape these you're just going to take an individual piece pull it into a light ball and then begin rolling it into a cylinder slowly working your hands out to get a nice tapered about 12 inch long log place one on a parchment-lined baking sheet at a diagonal because it's a bit too long you're going to need two different baking sheets obviously drape it with a damp towel and let it proof for about 20 minutes now once that's done take a sharp knife a razor or lame and score it lengthwise at a 45 degree and go all the way across the entire length of the dough optionally you can add a little grating of some parmesan or some grana patano whatever hard nice cheese you like now to bake this you're first gonna get a 10-inch skillet fill it with just about an inch of water bring that to a boil and as soon as it comes to a boil you're gonna open your oven which has been preheated to 400 degrees fahrenheit put in your dough slide your steaming water on a rack underneath your dough close the oven close the door and let it steam bake for eight minutes after that eight minutes is up immediately and quickly remove your steaming pan close the door and let it bake an additional 20 to 25 minutes or until you get a beautiful golden brown sort of sub sandwich bread then let it cool until completely room temp now let's talk about our meatballs i really prefer meatballs with a little bit of pork and a little bit of beef so for the beef i've got one pound of chuck roast here which i have grinding and half a pound of pork boston bud to equal out to one pound of ground beef and half a pound of ground pork obviously you can get it pre-ground but you know you won't be fully flexing if you do once that's ground just knead it a little bit kind of like a dough to get that fat nice and emulsified in a separate bowl whisk together two eggs to completely combine then add a third of cup or twelve grams of grated parmigiano-reggiano one teaspoon or two grams of finely ground fennel seeds one tablespoon of finely chopped fresh oregano leaves three slices of finely chopped i don't know i did that optionally a little bit of fresh grated nutmeg mix this together till combined add some fresh ground black pepper and a generous pinch of kosher salt then add three quarters of a cup or 42 grams of panko bread crumbs with a tiny little splash of milk just to help that hydrate then add in your ground meat knead mix until everything is completely homogenized emulsified and beautiful now good meatball mix is almost bouncy right watch me drop this in the bowl and it bounces it's got some buoyant you know what i mean now this next part is pretty straight forward you take your meat and you make balls we don't need to do anything fancy okay just use your hands and cup your balls it's not too hard now if you shape these evenly sized as much as possible you should get around 24 total beautifully round meatballs all right folks we're almost there so start off with a large skillet here i have a 12 inch saute pan fill it up with about three and a half tablespoons of high heat oil set it onto your stove at medium high heat once extremely hot add in your meatballs let them sit and sear for about two to three minutes until you get a beautiful deep brown crust now some people like to sear every single side personally i think two solid good sears is plenty fine but if you want to get every single side that's fine too now when they're done they'll probably still be raw on the inside so it's not really snack time yet okay once you're done searing your balls remove them and set them to the side we get a really simple saucer you're gonna need four ounces or 120 grams of pancetta ideally thick cut and diced reduce the heat to medium and toss that in your pan then just let that saute stirring occasionally until the majority of the fat has rendered out and you got some nice little crispy jewels then add 5 cloves of thinly sliced garlic let that saute for about 20 seconds or until fragrant then add a 28 ounce can of crushed san marzano tomatoes season that lightly with salt and pepper bring that up to a light summer over medium heat add your meatballs back and then let that simmer until the meatballs are completely and totally cooked about 8-10 minutes taste and adjust the salt and pepper levels if you need more now to assemble the sandwich take half of one of your loaves and you're going to cut through the center to open this bad boy up but don't cut all the way through leave that back end piece intact it's the traditional way place it under your broiler for about two to three minutes or until nicely toasted now optionally while that's toasting you can mix together a couple tablespoons of olive oil and a couple grated cloves of garlic maybe some flaky salt in there a little bit of black pepper then when it's done toasting just brush it with that garlicky olive oil that we're really just trying to maximize this sandwich experience but you don't have to do it if you don't want to rot brother the next part is in rock and science get your balls and put them on the bread all right that's the last of those jokes all right i'm sorry that's it's stupid cover with a little bit of the sauce top your meatballs with as much sliced provolone as your heart desires put it back under the broiler just until the cheese is melted like so then add a generous fresh grating of parmigiano-reggiano then finally top this beautiful beast with some finely chiffonaded fresh basil and that is a beautiful meatball sub ah wow just by looking at it [Music] we got our homemade meatball sub this extends way beyond butt better right the meatball sub could have been a standalone recipe as is oh yeah i can't [Music] put that do you really we won all right obviously we're gonna do a taste test but this is like the crunch you can taste every every little component olive oil garlic got the two different kinds of fresh ground meat prosciutto we got all the herbs got this beautiful tomato sauce okay so sandwich number one sandwich number two my vote is sandwich number one i like the first sandwich i was really which one so why why do you like number one more i liked the crunch of it i thought there was more flavors that were going on happening and then sandwich number two just tasted literally tastes like anything this one is just like a higher quality sandwich this one left a bad taste in my mouth i'm excited for people to try this at home like and make it i don't do it justice but do you want to know what else will take you to a delicious meaty land b-roll all right guys and that is it so we made subway meatball sandwiches more specifically we really just made a meatball sandwich i don't know i don't even want to compare this to a subway meatball sandwich all right that's it's it's in a different galaxy it's not even in the same fabric of reality to me this is a perfect testament of attention to detail and making sure every single layer is tended to and loved and cared and kissed so one quick thing that i wanted to mention uh we haven't had one of these talks in a while it's been so busy um i'm getting out of a bit of a whirlwind from work and i've been thinking about this really crazy project i've been working on i know a lot of people have been asking about aprons a lot of you now i was considering releasing them the other apron with the smiley face again i'm not really sure if i'm gonna do that because we're working on a very very special secret project nobody knows about but long story short i'm making something that is never existed before i don't want to get too much in the conversation about it because it's supposed to be a secret right now but it's a big deal it is a big deal and we have a huge team of people working on it and that's all i have to say you might want to wait for that but anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time my voice cracked apparently i'm 12.

264,264,How to Cook The Juiciest Chicken Breasts Of all Time,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mRB_UwH_nV0/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLA2HyOfoV5G8FRRuu589g_lozwgxw,mRB_UwH_nV0,"9 minutes, 10 seconds","The epic conclusion of Big Screen & Big BBQ, sponsored by Samsung. I'll grill some chickies while watching immortal guardians kick butt on The Terrace from Samsung (aka the best outdoor TV...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, chicken breast is the most commonly bought meat that I've ever seen but it's also the number one food that everybody seems to mess up nobody wants to eat dry yucky so listen carefully Kings the correct chicken breast movement chicken breast is extremely lean and that's why so many people get it cuz it's like oh this is healthy which is I guess true as the fat content of a meat shrinks so does the room for error I partnered with Samsung to launch the new terrace TV outdoor TV I talked about it on Instagram we're here now this is ip55 rated first and foremost I am a cook the cooler part is that I could do this [Music] so we're watching the old guard on Netflix Oh taste it's about an elite group of guardians that are immortal so if you don't know if something is immortal it's tough to kill do you want to know what's tough to eat and you might be thinking it's criminal weird paranoid you're but you guys know I'm all about weird parallels we're gonna be cooking chicken breasts properly the most excellent way we can in a grill Thank You Samsung for this opportunity we've got the TV so let's make this shall we okay so first let's set our grill for an offset heating system two-thirds of your grill should be around medium-high in the far left or far right third will be at low or medium low depending on how hot your grill kits then just preheat that until it reaches around 450 degrees Fahrenheit or 230 degrees Celsius now this one's gonna be super silly simple I mean literally salt and pepper and maybe some spice to see if you want to go that route lightly brush some bone-in skin-on chicken breast with high heat cooking oil seasoned as many as you want with salt and pepper and any other spices you'd like toasted on the hot side of the grill and get a mild amount of color you know turning in every minute or so for about five minutes then close the lid and keep your chicken on the cool side of the grill and let it cook for about 20 to 30 minutes maintaining that 450 keep checking on it every now and again and as soon as your chicken hits 165 fahrenheit or 75 degrees Celsius immediately remove it from the grill and let it rest for about 8 minutes it's about as simple as it gets now hold on you could also doll that up a bit by simply stuffing your chicken bobby's and of course pause the TV so you don't miss anything okay so first take another bone-in skin-on chicken breast and run your knife along the bone scraping repeatedly keeping your knife against the bone until you've removed a nice skin on but boneless chicken breast now to make this stuffing you're gonna start by finely chopping three slices of prosciutto heating a pan with about two and a half tablespoons or 40 milliliters of olive oil over medium heat until very hot now fry your brittle Shoup until they're weak wispy and golden about two minutes then remove it from the oil leaving the oil behind now while the pan is still nice and hot go ahead and toss in four to eight leaves of fresh sage fry until crispy about 30 seconds then place those on a paper towel to cool along with the pro scute oh brother sorry okay so what's your boneless butt skin plus chicken breast take a nice sharp knife and cut along the center's side of the breast to open it up like a nice little poultry book have a little read about this majestic birds ancestors and then stuff it with a nice handful of fresh Italian parsley the zest of half a lemon in your prosciutto sage mixture crushed up between your fingers now look if you want to be extra bougie then just take some your extra truffle that you have lying around and just go ahead and give it a fat grading then carefully roll your chicken up into a nice meaty log and then fasten it with three individual strips of kitchen twine evenly spaced apart like so make sure to tie a nice knot you know don't let it fall off or anything cook that the exact same way as before and definitely let this beast rest then slice into it to get these beautiful medallions with a nice vein of flavor running through it again tasty but not the easiest way to make it perfect now you might be thinking well Josh that's not very enticing and you'd be right except I do have one more trick up my sleeve so good start with some bone-in skin-on chicken breasts and we're gonna make a little marinade with a lot of ingredients so here we go combine the following four cloves of garlic which except for some reason today my garlic was gigantic so I guess two cloves if you have sicko mode garlic one shallot halved and peeled the juice of two oranges the zest of one whole lime the juice of three lemons the juice of two limes one tablespoon or 15 milliliters of honey half a bunch of mint have a bunch of cilantro 3 tablespoons our 45 milliliters of fish sauce and a splash of vinegar that you like such as cheek young vinegar blend that together oh wait oh God sorry a little more also to Thai chilies blend until smooth with a hand blender or a regular blender once smooth slowly streaming three tablespoons or 45 milliliters of olive oil till emulsified now you don't have to go that hard but you know I always recommend it anyway once you've got your marinade get some vacuum seal bags toss in a chicken breast or two pour in about a quarter cup of your marinade seal the bags until nice and airless then toss them in a sous-vide set 266 degrees Celsius for one to one-and-a-half hours this is the key here I know not everyone has one but it's really truly perfectly cooked now once you're done with your sous-vide pull your thicky chicky out of the bags what was pop I forgot to hit play brush them lightly with oil and season with salt toss them on a grill that's been preheated over medium-high heat nice and hot and then just grill them turning them often until nicely brown and crisp skinned little beauties that should take no more than about five minutes you don't want to cook the chicken here you just want some good color on it then again removing from the and let it rest for about eight minutes then slice into it and go into juicy heaven what I marinate I like to reserve a little on the side you know like stuff that doesn't touch the raw chicken to use on the finished chicken all right turn the TV off and let's give these three a taste okay so this is a little bit of a different one because we're outside and it's really hot and so I'm hot but Vikram can stay over here in the hot and I be cold while like yummy food in front of him very good chicken chicken and chicken all three different ways all done on the grill but all very different before we had the motorcycle guy and now we have a plane before was like me but now we have a plane it's like now everyone who's gonna eat this chicken is that let us be done there so this is the sous-vide chicken I'll eat that last I feel like that's probably gonna win but with the plain grilled okay so this is like salt pepper plain grilled a couple things to note on this it's good there's depth of flavor slight stringiness it was cooked to 165 I almost feel like it went a little over it's much harder to achieve perfect temperature unless you're a constant watching it with that said juiciness scale seven point five six to three out of ten this is the stuff and grilled regular so it's relatively the same thing but it's stuffed hence the main vein of flavor on this there's four planes in the air right now then there isn't in the history of mankind they decided this is the time why this one this one got a little bit more overcooked although not to the point that it's not edible and not to a point that I would necessarily say that it's bad and that's because the bone was removed it's much easier to maintain it with a bone it's good in the stuffing is what brings it forward so juiciness flavor scale seven six six point nine five two plus chicken emoji last but not least is the sous-vide chicken breast sous-vide marinated and grilled just for color though this to me reaches the pinnacle of chicky had been perfectly cooked ultra moist yes moist because that's the most descriptive word you don't get precision anywhere else at that level sous-vide plus browning method a cake grilling roiling searing sous-vide juicy flavor I'm gonna give it an 8 plus very good hand is the way to perfect chicken or you just have good technique and keep your eye on the temperature anyway by I'm not going all the way the water that's not happening but do you want to know what else is chicken II and moist oh geez B [Music] alright guys and that is it so this concludes our mini series big screen and BBQ with Samsung again thank you samsung for giving me the terrace TV oh you said all the time when I'm cooking out there use it on 4th of July it's it's really an outdoor game changer and I do mean that make sure to go right now to Samsung comm or the link in the description to check out the terrace TV and then obviously come back here to get your recipes with cooking chicken is still a basic thing but you have to give it the tender care and love that it needs in order to be big and stop myself today like I said before people go willy-nilly with this this is not the thing to go willy-nilly with bro so I hope

265,265,$14 Fancy Date Night Dinner At Home | But Cheaper,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zU9OP776xcE/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLCevn2N6nNYHA2KJhq4zz1grIjJPA,zU9OP776xcE,"9 minutes, 57 seconds","You can have a 3 course fancy date night dinner, which is under 15 dollars for two servings of every course. Yes, it's true. Welcome to But Cheaper Episode 2. 

Recipe: https://www.joshuaweissman.c...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, [Music] [Music] sometimes you just want to do something nice for that special somebody but maybe you don't want to spend 100 $8.32 maybe you want a fancy dinner for two for less than $15 [Music] there's a restaurant the chippy named or many if that that have sort of two for twenty right two meals two great meals for twenty dollars but I say we can beat that and more specifically and this isn't a but better more specifically date night is something that is commonly very expensive but it doesn't have to be if you go out and you get something for forty dollars which is twenty a person it most people might say looks pretty good but I really think you can have a three-course meal where the prices previously described think that price right there and there's nothing really that fancy about it could take common ingredients let them together use some proper technique and make a world-class and that's the whole point of this series now there's three pieces of this meal so I'm not gonna waste too much time here so with all that said let's do this shall we one second one second it's very late I'm editing right now I forgot to mention that same thing and I are doing a giveaway of a TV and a BBQ stuff and they'll be linked in the description I'm also doing it on my Instagram story so you can see it there okay so let's first start with our appetizer get a 10-inch skillet I didn't three tablespoons or 42 grams of extra-virgin olive oil set that over a medium heat until extremely hot and dump in 10 ounces or 280 grams of whole grape tomatoes so you'll need to cut them it's super simple now if they don't serve what's poppin right away and you gosh-darned pan ain't hot enough alright now keep cooking and stirring occasionally until they get a little charred and softened up three to five minutes then add three cloves of thinly sliced garlic season lightly with salt and pepper let that cook for about a minute then turn off the heat take it off the heat so little yachty on tick tock post about this toaster and so I haven't got one I don't know I don't know why it's the most unnecessary toaster I've ever had but anyway go ahead and get two slices of good crusty bread in your toaster and get them nice and well toasted now for both slices you'll need about a third a cup or 90 grams of ricotta divided evenly amongst the two top that with your nice garlicky plump juicy tomatoes hit it with some extra olive oil optionally some flaky salt and black pepper firstly cracked and some fresh herbs for garnish if you want it to look extra pretty now with all this put together if we're looking at just the serving cost because there's a lot of ingredients left over that puts the total cost of this appetizer for both toasts at three dollars and ninety four cents okay so this is now you eat it thank you let's go go you've got the sweet tomatoes they're charred they're blistered they're soft but they still have some texture it's garlicky you've got the olive oil the ricotta there's so many textures perfectly satisfying okay so now we're on to the main course surely it doesn't cost less than seven dollars for two plates of this well you're about to have your pancake slipped and don't call me Shirley so you need to start with some chicken leg quarters which is literally just the chicken drumstick plus the thigh attached I'm gonna take a nice sharp knife running along the length of the center of the thigh to reveal the thigh bone then down the drumstick to reveal the drumstick bone and I can kind of see that these two pieces are connected by those bones to first remove the thigh bone now it's everything's still attached but you're just kind of getting the thigh bone detached then repeating with the drumstick bone now once you can get your knife underneath the drumstick bone I recommend slicing it and cutting down just before you get to the end of the drumstick so it separates like this and yes my freshly sharpened boning knife did just shave that wood cutting board now all that's keeping it attached is the cartilage in the joint in the center of these two pieces carefully cutting that piece out removing his little meat as possible and now you have a boneless chicken leg corner now you only need two of these but a package of five costs about three dollars which makes it one dollar and 20 cents for two now to each of these you're gonna add two teaspoons or three grams of whole grain mustard a little bit of salt to taste a slice of Swiss cheese and four to five basil leaves then carefully roll your chickeny blanket all the way up to lock in that stuffing then use pieces of kitchen twine tired chicken together at three to four even intervals so now you kind of got like a little miniature roast repeat with your other chicken thigh I have three here because well I want an actor piece but so a large skillet with a couple tablespoons of oil enough to coat the bottom keep it over a medium-high heat until nice and hot Pat your meaty fruit roll-ups dry season generously with salt added in your chicken and sear on every side for about two minutes just to get a little bit of color now you don't want to brown this all the way because you're going to turn them back over facing the skin side up and placing your skillet into the oven set to 400 degrees Fahrenheit or 205 degrees Celsius for about 15 to 20 minutes or until cooked all the way through and the skin is nice and perfectly brown and crisp well that's cooking we're gonna make a very easy cauliflower puree subvert the floor it's from medium head of cauliflower and add them to a small pot of boiling water just boil that for about 8 to 10 minutes or until very very very soft I want it mushy it's okay if it's overcooked that's point straighten that through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl but reserve the water now place that cauliflower into a blender season it to taste with salt and 1/4 TSP of fresh grated nutmeg or ground nutmeg which cost nearly nothing if you already have it but if you don't then forget about it and begin blending adding just a little bit of water to loosen just until it begins to blend we're not making this soup once it starts to vortex then add 3 and 1/2 tablespoons or 50 grams of unsalted butter to your blender while continuously blending about a tablespoon at a time until all of your butter is added and is emulsified in and you should end up with a beautifully smooth and creamy cauliflower puree now we're gonna make kind of a chimichurri so with a quarter cup or five grams of fresh chopped parsley 1 red Fresno chili very finely chopped I know we're stacking pricier now got to be careful the zest and the juice of one lemon and six cloves of garlic grated and cover with a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of olive oil now the pricing on olive oil really varies depending on what you buy so if you buy really cheap stuff then it's gonna be cheaper so this is just an estimate so using that to taste with salt and pepper mix it together until thoroughly combined and you're ready to roll so to plate this up it's very simple all right don't be a scaredy little baby so first thing take your chicken take off the twine now I like to cut the ends off so the pieces stand up properly but you don't have to do that then slice this into three evenly sized rounds pick a nice looking plate add a thick dollop of your cauliflower puree take the back of your spoon and slide it across the plate to create a nice little swoosh add your three rounds facing up so you can see that nice little coil on the inside and then optionally you can garnish it with more sliced Fresno chilies or parsley spoon on your chimichurri as much as you like optional and garnish with parsley and bone apple the teeth to you that puts two of these beauties at six dollars and 88 cents one time course number two which is well really just the entree chicken thigh Ballentine cauliflower puree chimichurri red Fresno yummy-yum sauce how you put it in okay yes series it's like good to watch and you're like oh I'm gonna have a good date night with my girlfriend but guess what I have to let this stuff sit down and get cold for you it ruins my date night no idea how good this was killer first on to dessert get yourself a ten inch skillet unnecessarily and aggressively toss in a quarter cup or 56 grams of unsalted butter please set pan into an oven set to foreigner' degrees Fahrenheit or 205 degrees Celsius and tell melted but while that's going peel to Bosc pears then cut them in half and scoop the core out as best you can once the butter in your pan is melted sprinkle on one cup or 225 grams of brown sugar a small pinch of salt give a little shake to see that it's not going anywhere that's for fun place your pears in the pan cut side down and place back in the oven for 25 minutes by then your sauce should be bubbling and melting once that 25 minutes is up baste each pair every two minutes for 10 minutes pull out your hot saucy boys pull out a nice-looking plate and then using a single serving of unflavored yogurt add a little smear on the bottom of the plate AB one of your pear pieces cut side down spoon on your caramel sauce and optionally you can top with granola or nuts or whatever crunchy thing you have in your pantry that makes sense on this maybe not fried onions that would be weird or would it fried onions are not - these plates combined sit at four dollars and nine cents let's give this a taste caramel pears with yogurt pecans and obviously a caramel glaze that's my cue got a sticky lacquer on the outside of the pear instead of the pears still moist and has some texture - it's not total mush refreshing it's rich it's everything you want nice but do you want to know what else is refreshing and rich b-roll [Music] he made a three-course meal it was about this amount of money because they don't know yet because I'm recording this before I did the math and Josh is not very good in fact this is this is one of those moments where you're like oh yeah I would pay $40 for that or I would pay $80 that the actual ingredient cost cut it down all the way this is really emphasizing the but cheaper series the importance of understanding this make these recipes that will be happy and they're gonna be like man you're a boss this must have cost you Aladdin money buddy and that's the whole point so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned submental you like to subscribe and I will see you next time and also I know people are complaining that you're not back in the cabinet I'm just trying to diversify if you want to go back in the cabinet let me know in the comments

Check out how this TV will change your outdoor entertainment...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, Oh see think corn should just be cast as a side dish no it's about time that corn gets treated as a main event [Music] we'll go back to the second episode of big screen and barbecue with my partner's Samsung so as you guys know we'll be watching stuff on the terrace TV Samsung's latest new TV their first outdoor TV which is a big deal so we'll be grilling and chilling watching a movie and talking about that new TV the terrace again this movie is based in Cuban it's got a lot of Cuban vibes it's Spira and blue water it's outside so it makes me think okay we're grilling and we need Cuban spice and I thought all right I'm already in the mood for you lotte but what if we added a little bit of a Cuban twist to it I said this last time but this TV has revolutionized cooking outdoors for me I mean it's been a huge deal I'm really excited to be a part of this whole thing with them so with all that said let's do this shall we now sir with four whole corn left in their husk then just go ahead and peel them I like to peel them like a banana but leave that little sort of stick at the end right you don't need to stick because it's got its own and if you want to make it a little bit cuter you could take some of your corn leaves and sort of tie it at the base of that little nub there and get a nice little bow isn't that cute I mean that that's Michelin I've cooked them lightly in our neutral tasting oil like canola place them on your grill begin grilling them rotating them every so often so you get some light charring but be careful not to drive the corn out right we want this a nice plump and juicy now while that's grilling let's get a little mayonnaise going we're gonna make this the og way no fancy tools just a bowl and a whisk sort of by separating two egg yolks into your bowl followed by two teaspoons or 10 grams of stone ground mustard 2 teaspoons or five grams of smoked paprika powder some salt to taste and about 1 tablespoon or 14 milliliters of white distilled vinegar what's call that together and now look I know a lot of you guys have seen this before right you keep whisking while slowly streaming in the oil but I have a little trick here for you instead use a little squirt bottle and start off by squirting little droplets of oil while constantly whisking and then once that it's begins to emulsified slowly move towards a nice steady stream of 1 Cup or 240 milliliters of neutral tasting oil like remember to continuously whiskey you not want this to break you're constantly whisking once all of your oil is added you should have a nice thick beautiful stabilized mayonnaise another beautiful stabilized thing is the tears TVs anti glare look at the Sun even with these crazy blinding rays and a little bit of partial shade the picture comes through on the terrace totally clear anyway back to our corn now once your corn is nice and grilled and it looks like this take it off the grill brush it with a generous amount of your smoked chili Mayo now off to the side over here I have about two cups or 240 grams of finely grated cotija cheese and then simply take your corn and coat it generously on every little square inch of the corn with your graded cotija once it's thoroughly coated give it a little drizzle of some hot sauce I prefer either Valentina's or Tapatio up to you though okay so we have our lotte which will taste in a second but first let's talk about a deconstructed version again start by grilling your corn and look a little bit of a note that I didn't say before when you grow your corn you need to cook corn fun fact you can eat corn raw really most of the time you're just heating corn up you don't really want to mushy you want that crunch speaking of crunchy let's quickly talk about how crisp this picture quality is cooking cute led make this water I feel like you could pop all right ideally with you know lotte in hand now back to the corn so just give that light char and get it nice and hot and you'll need about two whole pieces of corn for this once you've grilled two pieces of corn remove all the kernels with a knife place it in a bowl and add three tablespoons or 42 grams of your smoked chili mail that you made earlier along with some salt to taste do teaspoons of smoked paprika and a tablespoon of Moho seasoning the juice from half of a lime then stir all that together you've got your baseline flavor set up right just spoon some of that corn into a bowl top it with a little drizzle of your hot sauce some pickled red onion some diced avocado and some thinly sliced really nice quality serrano chiles some freshly grated aged Monge goat cheese it's really we're really getting fancy here with the Monge and then finally some cilantro leaves to garnish to make it look like a pretty little garden you're then going to shovel into your mouth okay I know this looks smaller than you had expected more like a salty creamy is it better or worse I don't know bird chill anyway so there's a load day it's pretty good okay would I say it it's the same as an original probably not but it's good and I enjoyed it very cool thank you guys alright moving on to the next one so we got a deconstructed hello tape it's not traditional at all people will be mad and that's okay alright I'm not gonna say this is better because it's so different that it's not the same thing but do I enjoy it more kind of only because it's easier to eat and there's more texture and flavor but in the world of simplicity you cannot defeat an original Lotte if this isn't a battle okay this was simply just a rediscovery but you want to know what else is a rediscovery [Music] alright guys in that is its so we made a Lotte to different ways one very traditionally and then one deconstructed with a little bit of Cuban spice now is that dish revolutionary hmm well maybe not as revolutionary as the tariff TV but it is extraordinarily satisfying and it deserves a spot on your table again thank you to Samsung for partnering with us to do this beautiful miniseries big screen and barbeque it's been a ton of fun and

Now Making Cinnabon cinnamon rolls may prove to be just as easy if not easier. Will we be able to defeat the coveted...,2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, people like Josh that's not possible well that's what this series is all about making me impossible possible you think a little cinnamon roll is gonna be a problem today we're gonna be making Cinnabon cinnamon rolls but better now this is one that a lot of people are afraid of touch they think they're just you can't make them better right you can't right wrong wrong wrong that's not really a very good melody but you get the point it's not my job to do melodies it's my job to swing my cinnamon roll soars so that's what we're gonna do so with all that said let's make this show so apparently finding a Cinnabon a lot of them are in malls I know buddy wouldn't be it I'm alright now because it's kind of there's the Cinnabon underneath Schlotzsky's where's the Schlotzsky's it's over there why would they do that they literally said we'll put a sign here but it's actually over dere over there let me go get it some weight to it I think it's time for the tasting we got oh I told you this had weight to it that that's really gross how that's not I wish that would fall smells nice dough and sugar and cinnamon bit this is fresh-baked today and it's like rock that that is not good what is that all right my mouth is watering though cuz smells really good so I'll give them that look how dry this is and it's still dangling the poop string it tastes good it could be a little more cinnamony pricing only tastes like sugar yeah we already got it in the bag okay so to make these synonym rolls we're gonna do something a little bit different first start with the medium-sized bowl to that you're gonna add four cups or 580 grams of all-purpose flour 1/2 a cup 107 grams of granulated sugar and 3/4 of a teaspoon or 6 grams of fine sea salt then realize that you're gonna do this in a sustained mixer Bolan also that your current bulb was never large enough so put it in a stand mixer bowl give that some whisky business until thoroughly combined to that you're gonna add 1/3 a cup for 84 grams of unsalted softened butter take two forks and just kind of blend that in there and took it's thoroughly incorporated with the dry flour you'd also use your fingers to press that together as well now separately I've got one cup or 235 grams of lukewarm milk whole milk that is around 100 degrees fahrenheit to that you're gonna add two and a quarter teaspoon or seven grams of instant yeast and just simply started to dissolve because we're using instant you don't need to let it sit unless you're worried that it's dead in which case yes pop the flour mixture onto the stand mixer begin mixing on medium low speed using the spiral dough hooky thing how's your yeasty milk two whole eggs and one egg yolk good just let that mix on medium low speed for about two to three minutes or until you get a nice smooth dough now look I know a lot of people are gonna be like Josh shoot I don't have a stand mixer cool then you can totally do this by hands just a little bit more difficult now once that dough pulls together pull it off your stand mixer make sure to give the dough hook a little taste does this look dangerous to you because it is don't plop your dough onto a lightly floured work surface and just give it a little knead for about 30 seconds to a minute just to help really smooth it out and get that gluten structure formed now that dough's gonna be a little bit loosey-goosey and that's okay roll that into a light ball pop it into a greased Bowl and cover it with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let it rise at room temperature for one and a half hours or until doubled make sure to give a little so a personality all right come on give it some love some maybe some kisses now once your dough is ready let's mix together our cinnamon sugar to do that you're gonna need one cup or 225 grams of brown sugar 1 tablespoon of 14 grams and Muscovado sugar that's optional and two and a half tablespoons or 17 grams of ground cinnamon give that some whiskey business until thoroughly combined now lightly flour or work surface punch down and dump out your chunky dough flatten it and then roll it into a large rectangle it's a little bit over a quarter of an inch thick so you want a pretty thin and look this rectangle is gonna be big like 27 inches long roughly but felis does do length really matter it does yeah then you're gonna spread 1/3 a cup or 84 grams of unsalted softened butter all across the surface of it make sure that this butter is really really soft otherwise it's not gonna spread and it's gonna tear your dough then take your cinnamon sugar and spread all of it evenly across the surface of your dough you should use all your filling then tightly roll it up from the bottom all the way up to the top so you get a nice beautiful thick log then using the serrated blade with scalloped edges and not to the edges because to the edges are meaning they tear the poop out of this so it's no good anyway slice it into segments that are about two inches thick you should end up with 12 solid rolls give or take a couple scratchers that's okay lovely grease a nine by 13 baking dish all the link of the description for mine line the bottom of the pan with your cinnamon rolls should get nice and even rows of three it's cool if they touch you want that make sure to face their little tails towards each other now once your whole pan is filled with cinnamon rolls lightly cover with plastic wrap and let that rise at room temperature for about 30 to 45 minutes or until they're one and a half times original size remove your plastic wrap then just pop those bad boys into the oven set to 375 Fahrenheit or 190 Celsius for 15 to 20 minutes or until they get beautifully risen plump golden brown cinnamon rolls pull those up and let those cool in their container for about 15 minutes now to make your vanilla bean cream cheese glaze gonna start with four ounces or 115 grams of fat cream cheese whip on high speed until nice and smooth then blend in three quarters of a cup or 90 grams of powdered sugar until completely smooth then mix in three tablespoons or 45 milliliters of whole milk you may need a little more but this should suffice once you get a nice thick but still drizzle a bowl inside a word glaze add half of a vanilla bean script of its seeds you can save the pod for later whisk that in and you've got your glaze okay so at this point in time your bun should be cooled but still quite warm now you can just go ahead and drizzle on your cream cheese glaze use all of it that is a cinnamon roll no we got to do is taste it we got to hot what I say let's try me singing name role bruh and I don't say that look at the bottom of this caramelize like a candy apple bottom geez I don't even know what I'm saying I don't even want to say anything about this at this point just try the recipe because it's just so astronomically better the first bite I promise you're gonna be like [Music] [Applause] every time today because back all right so today we can Bikram's back by popular demand thank you so much for requesting okay so we have number one and we have number two here's number one that's on the bag and then number two just before I take the mask off one or two Howell say number two was better because it was softer yeah I wasn't dry at all it was just a good wiener again you just can't stop you want to call yourself the world-famous cinnamon roll then you're gonna have to go through me and today I don't think that really worked out where you broke my better episode 14 we win but do you want to know what else is ultra-thick e sticky [Music] we're guys and that is it so we made it Cinnabon cinnamon rolls now here's the whole breakdown the whole thing right there's two pieces of this story obviously the cinnamon rolls need to be warm in order to be their best all right warmed bow it was a clear winner it really was a hard thing for most people is like Cinnabon cinnamon rolls are supposed to be big fresh and therefore it's hard to compete with them right because it's the fresh-baked quality that makes them better but you forgot about one very specific component and that is love when you roll that dough out and you lay down and go to sleep with it there's just no other comparison now you don't actually have to sleep with your dough but the point is that you can make it far better cinnamon rolls by just taking the time to make them yourself and that is the beauty of this series that is why we're doing this we are teaching everybody just the right way there's nothing special about it so anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe

fine but why do that when you can make one of the greatest meats for tacos of all time all right so listen up kudos this isn't just some normal video I'm ecstatic to announce that I have officially partnered with Samsung and this video is the very first episode of our mini series big screen and BBQ where we'll be screening our favorite TV shows and movies on their all-new outdoor TV the tears we're gonna be getting out of the kitchen and start grilling if you think about it watching movies and cooking it's kind of like a wine pairing but like a TV is not like a beverage that makes you feel better so now that it's warmer I've been barbecuing and cooking outdoors a little more and this TV has completely revolutionized that without sacrificing anything you don't need to replace it every year it can handle the harsh outdoors and the quality of the picture actually genuinely shocked me when I first saw it and I'm not no tech guy all right I'm just speaking from something in between the head and the heart I guess the mouth now with all that said let's do this shall we then I make your help a storm eaten you start with a marinade and we're not using any chili powder here all right we're big boy ships I want you to start with four dried ancho chilies and five dried guajillo chilies both of which you should seed unless you want it a little spicier place them in a heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water and when I say boiling I mean well boiling we're not making some sort of calming tea you need to let them sit until they get nice and soft so they're terrible like you can tear them I mean English was not on my side there or well I maybe I just yeah okay I don't know how to speak English all right so no blender you're gonna combine 3/4 of a cup or 180 milliliters of white vinegar 1 cup or 240 milliliters of pineapple juice three and a half tablespoons or 65 grams of achiote paste 2 10 cloves of garlic yeah I don't know why I did it like this because now it's splashing all over my face but you know maybe start with dry next time 2 tablespoons are 28 grams of brown sugar 2 teaspoons are 5 grams of ground cumin two teaspoons are five grams of ground cinnamon and three tablespoons or 30 grams of kosher salt add your soap Chile's then just blend that until you get a smooth yet viscous red marinade next you gonna take a four to five pound boneless pork shoulder this is a Boston but then just slice that bad boy into half-inch or one and a quarter centimeter slices the whole darn thing I want little slices all over the place place it in a bowl pour over your marinade make sure to get this nice and tossed and thoroughly coated with your marinade you can either leave it in the bowl or you can place it in a baking dish like this so it's nice and snug place some plastic wrap on top to make sure everything is submerged and let it marinate overnight you can use this day of but the overnight marinade helps a lot and while that's marinating overnight you too can marinate overnight probably watching a little bit more of last chance you to keep a pet Stadium food inspiration now once grilling time comes around you get some good old fashioned skewers I would recommend getting metal ones you know the wooden ones are just too dang flimsy you'll need three to four of them then just take your slices of meat and begin to stab on your skewers I know it's gonna start a little awkward at first all right that's it Sookie and rinse and repeat did you get a nice tall stacked log of meat so essentially you're trying to recreate that sort of like spindle roast style meat that you usually see now passed or go ahead and get your grill set up for offset heating meaning you want 2/3 of it hot around medium-high and one-third of it completely off and cold once your grill is nice and hot lightly brush your grates with oil good and sear your all pests or meat just to seal the edges two to three minutes per side get a tiny bit char place it on the cold side of the grill close your lid and play with the knob so that you land anywhere between 350 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and look like grill roast for about one and a half to two hours what else do you do when you're waiting on your meat go inside and watch TV you like these guys last chance you make sure to check it intermittently and flip occasionally until you get beautifully cooked and lightly charred I'll Pastore meat taken off the grill wrap it in foil and let it rest for about 20 minutes all I got to do is stand your roast up and slice it lengthwise to get something resembling pretty close to help a store meat you can slice it thick you can slice it thin that's up to you so you're ready to assemble tacos right wrong first gonna make a nice little pineapple relish obviously you're gonna need one whole pineapple cut the top off then the bottom and I get two flat surfaces late with a cut side down and then carefully run your knife around the shape of the edge of the pineapple slowly working all the way around the pineapple to skin it like so then cut it in half cut those halves in half to get quarters then lightly grease your grates turn your grill to high heat once your grill is ripping hot go ahead and toss in your pineapple quarters one to two jalapenos and one whole sweet onion that's been cut into rounds then just grill that until everything's nice and lightly charred cut everything into bite-size pieces I like to slice the jalapeno so it's nice and thin place it in a bowl along with a quarter cup of fresh chopped cilantro the juice in the zest of two limes season that with salt generously mix it together until thoroughly combined now you can assemble your tacos heat up your corn tortillas I like to make them so that they're just very lightly browned or charred add on your meat along with your grilled pineapple relish rather than lime wedges I like to make little lime cheeks you know why also you can obviously add some avocado and cotija cheese if you wish to be a little extra bougie but do you wanna know what else wishes to be a little extra bougie b-roll or bougie roll ha ha ha [Music] taco al pastor not super traditional right we paid our respect to the tradition but we just took a little bit of a curve we had a sort of a grilled pineapple relish salsa something in between that tortilla corn should be corn in my opinion for this tacos anyway I did kind of a bite after not being able to go out though restaurants all my favorite taco places I've been waiting in sadness and now it's finally back in my mouth this is all the flavors that you want in a taco charred meat its fatty it's got some saltiness some spicy some sweet there's a reason why I passed or is my favorite do I think it's perfectly traditional no but do I think it's a correct rendition at home that's doable yes all right guys and that is it thank you again to Samsung for partnering with us to make this don't miniseries make sure to keep your eyes peeled for episode 2 & 3 coming very soon right so we made our past or now what I say this is the most traditional out past door of all time no of course it's not but it's extremely close flavor-wise visually you get that sort of like meaty anxiousness that you want from a beautiful ah past or and you made it yourself there's flexibility in the way you do it maybe you want like a little more chard maybe you like it a little more light it's it's all up to you and that's the beauty of this recipe it's the entry way to learning more about it so as usual if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and I will see you next time I've always cracked that's always good thanks Josh very cool [Music]

As a matter of fact, these quick and easy steak tips and methods aided with the Quicker Picker Upper will be your secret because, with...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, steak is probably one of the most expensive things that most people like to buy a new donor only felt right for the first episode to date you ever see a buck cheaper a show where we combine the most expensive version of something and find a way to make that more affordable using classic cooking techniques that could make it taste better than its more expensive counterpart [Music] nice you're out of the cabinet which is normal for this series a very first episode is sponsored by bounty the quicker picker-upper so thank you to bounty for helping me provide these quick and easy steak methods bounty are two times more absorbent than other paper towels so you can do more with less so as I said before we have two different steaks completely different this one is $70 this one is five dollars and seventy five cents now let's figure out how to make a steak but cheaper why is episode one of like this we live in Texas is so big is cheap do my best to appease everybody in life on the proper steak across the board not just for Texas people in it let's take a quick look at our little sticky boys so we got one for 575 and another for $60 pretty big difference okay so the first thing we're gonna start with is gonna be our money bag steak now this is a Wagyu New York Strip it's not quite a five but it was still about seventy dollars so I would count that as expensive now if we're gonna ball out on price we might as well ball out on the cookery of it yeah so go ahead and crack out the old sous-vide circulator set up to about a hundred and twenty nine degrees Fahrenheit or 54 degrees Celsius while that's heating take your steak season it generously with salt and pepper place it in a vacuum seal bag one with one and a half tablespoons of butter and some rosemary - the sous-vide stuff this brings our cost at this 6150 yes I know about the nono on putting butter in the vacuum bag we'll be talking about that at the very end of this video anyway once you have sealed your meat and your funky meat jacuzzi is ready drop in your snake and sous vide for one to two hours depending on the thickness one hour for one inch two hours for an inch and a half thick then simply pull your steak out sorry pull it your quicker picker-upper and Pat it dry with the bounty paper towel this drying technique is gonna help you get an extra good sear then just heat a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat with about why don't have to teach the spoons of high heat oil in it enough to coat the bottom of the pan now once that's nice and hot drop in your steak and aggressive Cerre for about a minute per side you want to do this as quickly as possible not cooking the steak we just want to get a beautiful brown crust like that that's done throw in a couple tablespoons of butter along with some aromatics like rosemary or thyme some crushed cloves of garlic left in their pod and then just base repeatedly in butter for about 20 to 30 seconds again this needs to happen quickly do not cook your steak just get color then pull it out of the pan and let it rest for about five to ten minutes and then that's it you just slice it up and enjoy but now let's make our cheaper version it's difficult to make steak cheap because you're limited by the cut so most bargain cuts are chewier than a leather boot all right and I know that my personal choice would be a little secret cut known as the Chuck I stick this is cut from the chuck roast many budgets will have this you can always ask them for this I'm going to cook it very simply first make sure your Chuck eye stick is at least an inch to an inch and a half thick start by adding two tablespoons of high heat oil to a 10-inch skillet by the way here's another quicker picker-upper trick where you can take a bounty paper towel wrap it around the base of your oil bottle then using either rubber bands or kitchen twine tie it on to your bottle that way when you pour it into the pan any dribbles are caught on the towel and doesn't get the bottle all yucky anyway heat your oiled pan over medium-high heat until it's just about to smoke make sure to pet your steaks super dry with a bounty paper towel season it generously with salt and pepper and add it to your ripping hot pan sear for two to three minutes or until you get a beautiful brown crust flip and sear for an additional two to three minutes at 3 tablespoons or 40 grams along with any Hardy herbs and crushed garlic cloves and baste repeatedly with the butter until you reach a beautiful medium rare around 135 degrees Fahrenheit pull it out and let it rest for 5 minutes I like to coat it with a little bit of butter I could just slice it up and serve it as is but just as an extra layer gonna make a little corn relish take one raw corn on the cob shuck it and remove the kernels place them in a bowl you can see it the corn cob for stock to that you're gonna add two red Fresno chilies finely sliced half of a sweet onion very finely diced he'd even mince a little bit if you want some nice little limes I don't know why I did that the juice of two limes a quarter cup of fresh chopped parsley a good healthy splash of extra-virgin olive oil season taste with salt and pepper mix it together and you got a nice little corn relish then it's lace up your cheap steak which kind of sounds like the Dyslexic version of cheapskate top it with your corn relish along with some of its juices let's taste these bad boys this is the tasting time but first we have to talk about bounty hack number three let's go red wine she is broke the price of this one now let's think about that for a second and for the record I just cut a smaller portion here there's more steak over there these were about the same weight so let's start with the expensive one you know this is supposed to be the maximum no geez nope no this is not a 5 Miyazaki but it is incredibly tender incredibly marbled and the flavor is try the second one sometimes the Fresno chilies are spicier than I remembered I mean okay I'll be honest with you I like beauty and simplicity with a steak this one to me close to being better but we're being ten tons the price no no and this is just about as good as this you've got the extra lift from those dressing you've got the extra live from the relish that's on this the steak itself was actually really tender I feel like people associate low price chewy steak not true bro look at the end of the day if you have $70 to dish out for an extra steak sure fine but this is but cheaper and if you have $7.00 then you can still make one of the greatest stakes of your life here we good but do you want to know what else makes the greatest steak of its life doesn't make any sense [Music] okay guys and that is it so we made two different steaks one of which was significantly more expensive than the other and yet potentially the cheaper one was better and thank you again to bounty the quicker picker-upper for sponsoring this video thank you okay so I know this is a little bit different of a video I know that we are used to being in the cabinet we're not leaving the cabinet I'm just saying that you get to come out whenever we do this series you're out well and then I'm gonna put you back in he's stay in there you know I hope you guys enjoy this new series please let me know in the comments what you think of this what do you want to see me make cheaper if you want something for me to take that's expensive or maybe just out of your budget and find a way to put it in your budget and make it labored through but with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and I will see you next time don't know why I've closed the door so instead we just put their bounty in front like these thank you brandy sinka same temperatures same length of cook time they both smell identical with butter without butter just facts the idea of a tablespoon or two of butter in a bag in a soupy bag for an hour ruining your steak is a ludicrous thought in my opinion but all I want us with people to challenge knowledge that's it I've been tasting so much steak and I keep thinking like maybe it's better maybe it's not I really can't tell but the fact that I'm wracking my brain so much about it tells me that maybe it's true but pretty my new pretty much my final verdict here was not necessarily that it ruins the steak but more so it just doesn't contribute that much once you've gone through the whole cooking process long story short you could leave the butter out and it's probably gonna be completely fine with or without it depending on cook time they can send all the other various variables [Music]

You can't make the perfect homemade key lime pie without... you guessed it, KEY LIMES! I'm sharing this...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, all right all right we're getting tired of not be able to go anywhere I'm getting sick of it I just want to go somewhere but I can't so instead we're gonna travel using our kitchen as a carpet we're first gonna stop by the Florida Keys okay so obviously the key lime pie relies on key limes obviously you know without the mood just be gone anyway these widow babies grow naturally in the Florida Keys and they're way more tart and fragrant than their lime brethren the first key lime pie recipe was written by a shift salvager it's rumored that they got the recipe from sponge divers who would make the recipe from what they had on their boat you know canned milk limes eggs since this bad boy can be make without baking then they can throw it together and make a delicious dessert without the aid of an oven but since eating raw eggs is a bad idea I'm gonna be using a more modern version but you want to know what else is a bad idea not having home or car insurance that's where today's sponsor Geico comes in just like the bundle of delicious ingredients to create the key lime pie it's a more sort of conceptual deliciousness but you see what I'm saying if you combine your home or car insurance you could save even more so for bundling made easy visit geico.com today the link is in the description you know what to do you can't have a nice Key Lime Pie without a nice graham quacky bust but if you know me we are gonna use the store-bought stuff ho ho no by the way quick history lesson did you know graham crackers were invented to quell human desire that's a fun fact that I only hate a little bit anyway to make your primal urge curbing crackers you'll need to start by mixing together 3/4 of a cup or 116 grams of all-purpose flour one and a half cups are 211 grams of whole wheat flour 1/4 cup or 60 grams of brown sugar half a teaspoon or two grams of fine sea salt one teaspoon or four grams of baking powder and one and a half teaspoons or four grams of ground cinnamon give that some whiskey business until thoroughly combined now separately crack 1 large whole egg in a medium-sized bowl whisk that brother up and add in three and a half tablespoons our 50 milliliters of whole milk 1/4 cup our 80 grams of honey and 3 tablespoons our 42 grams of a neutral tasting oil by the way extra virgin olive oil works to in and also sort of adds an interesting little flavor now add your eggy mixture to the flour mixture then just mix that together in need until you form a nice dough if it's too dry than just add a little splash of milk now once you got a nice smooth dough wrap him up in plastic wrap give Graham a little smiley and let it rest in the fridge for about thirty minutes to an hour now once he's had a nice little sleep rip him from his little plastic bed and roll him out to an eighth of an inch thick look at the end of the day we're gonna crush this stuff up sorry about it so there's no need to cut any sort of pattern or whatever just place it on a baking sheet line with parchment paper punch little holes with a fork and bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 to 20 minutes or until dry and crisp and lightly Brown then let your desire crackers cool tell oh cool now making the pie is actually a lot easier than making the graham crackers in my opinion haha oops now to make the pie first get your feeling prepared it's a key lime pie so call me crazy but I think you should probably use key limes with that said I understand the key limes aren't available everywhere so of course you can use regular limes and I'll only be a widow way angry at you now in a medium-sized bowl add four egg yolks here's a cool way that I like to separate my yolks I'll crack all the eggs into a vessel and then separate them out by hand now start whisking your yolks and then you're gonna add one tablespoon or four grams of fresh key lime zest that's been roughly chopped to get it a little finer you know you want it to look nice then 14 ounces or 400 grams of sweetened condensed milk which by the way you could make this from scratch and I have a recipe for my sweetened condensed milk in my pumpkin pie video which you should go take a look at anyway finally whisk in half a cup or 120 million of key lime juice once that's thoroughly combined cover it with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temperature while you prepare the crust this resting period is crucial to the thickening process that was thick with foursie's now to prepare your crust take your graham crackers that you worked so hard on place them in a little plastic bag and beat them until you get mostly fine crumbs yep we made them just to crush them welcome to fine dining now place your graham cracker crumbs into a medium-sized bowl along with 1/3 a cup or 70 grams of brown sugar 3/4 of a teaspoon or three grams of fine sea salt was that together then mix in 3/4 of a cup or 168 grams of unsalted melted butter until thoroughly incorporated you get a nice sort of wet sand mixture presented into a 9-inch pie Pole pie pie pie more oh my oh my god into eight nine inch pie mold nice and evenly it's a little easier if you use the bottom of a flat cup or something then bake your crust at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes to set pull it out let it cool completely then pour in your filling and bake it in the oven at the same temperature for 15 to 17 minutes or until set but still quite jiggly pull it out and let it cool most of the way off then refrigerate it until completely chilly and cold at least three hours but ideally overnight now all you got to do is give it a little slice EYC serve it with a nice dollop of whipped cream some fresh grated key lime zest and get ready to enter the florida zone okay so we got it stop bow like that echo I hate it I'll give you this without any reverb effect at all Oh Oh see we don't even need a defects post-production because I'm still settling it okay it's been a crazy week key lime pie will correct that look at this distinct layers perfect crust two key lime ratio I mean bro this is a perfect key lime pie I haven't even said anything and I've already eaten so much of it the crust crispy crunchy sweet salty glam crackling but the custard I mean it actually tastes like key lime it's not just like sweet a little bit tart no I'm saying like when you eat this it's like limes the whipped cream I mean you know it adds a nice creaminess but blast perfect on its own I mean my god ro brings me back to my childhood my mom would take me to this restaurant when I lived in LA and we would eat kill and pie together and it's bringing back all those memories they said of the Stacia way better than that key lime pie so make yourself some key lime pie and be taken away to memory Islands the Florida Keys mermaids lines all in a nice little what was a pod but the keys take you away now do you wanna know what else is key lime e and zesty b-roll

You asked for a homemade how-to guide on a mcgriddle and I think we just hit this bad boy outta the park. I'm talking homemade griddle cakes plus...,2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, there are only a few times in life where you're able to prove the impossible and the last time we talked about mickey d's we did this is another one of those times [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome back to bud better episode 13 14 i'm really bad at keeping track of this stuff so the mick riddle is pretty straightforward right it's two sort of injected pancakes with egg bacon and cheese or sausage if you or sausage whatever you know i was thinking about this and i developed this recipe last second day of and i gotta say it worked out pretty dang good with all that said let's make this shall we oh they have an armored vehicle here i mean they do have they do be making billions of dollars and stuff so good morning to mcdonald's hi i've actually never been here before what do you guys think of the mcgriddle you thought you went on my griddle yes please i'll do a bacon egg and cheese she was not having it i was like what do you think of the mcgriddle and she's like you want to make griddle thank you please don't ask me questions about a mcgriddle we sell them you either want one or you don't if they hit their hand like waiting out the window over the car they're like oh thank you me too we got the bag i like the the artwork here mcd olds really good first off this bacon is boom it smells okay but honestly i don't really smell anything but the over pouring maple flavor oh listen to this you want to eat that i mean what is this what is this egg way overcooked egg is like dry gelatinous stuff the bacon's very overcooked there just turn that into dust i almost missed motorcycle guy at this point i feel like he would come in and be like but now it's more like but the real question is can we do better i'm not loving it not loving it it's okay i'm okaying it how about that that doesn't sound as good mcdonald's coming for you again again so as i'm examining this mick griddle oh it's actually sounding kind of good like mcdonald's diss track maybe gonna hit you with the little widow gonna knock them off like they are so very little all right that's uh that's enough i need to figure out how to get this maple syrup injection stuff so to make that you're gonna start with one cup or 240 milliliters of maple syrup a good one put that in a small saucepan set that over medium heat and bring it to a nice simmer and you're simply going to continue to simmer and reduce that fluctuating your temperature as necessary so it doesn't foam over because that would be sad until your mixture reaches 265 degrees fahrenheit or 130 degrees celsius you're essentially making a hard ball candy now once it reaches that temperature which will take about 10 to 15 minutes you're then gonna get a baking sheet lined with parchment paper carefully pour your mixture over that in a nice even layer spread it out before it cools and then just let that cool to room temperature now what you end up with is sort of this like stretchy nougat now from here all you got to do is take small little pieces of the nougat and roll it into tiny little balls i'm talking like a quarter inch in diameter don't make them too big now once you've made over your balls let's talk about these griddle cakes which is essentially sort of like a pancake and no i'm not making any jokes about my griddle cakes alright that's that's enough this is optional but i actually prefer to cook my bacon first before i make my griddle cakes just because you know bacon flavor so if you are making your bacon first it's pretty simple you lay down your bacon in a cold pan or on a cold griddle heat it up over medium heat and then just keep turning often until you get a beautifully browned crispy set of bacon as much as you like depending on the amount of sandwiches you need six to eight slices is enough for four sandwiches now once all your bacon's done to make your griddle cake batter you're gonna mix together one and a half cups or 225 grams of all-purpose flour two teaspoons or 9 grams of baking powder 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of sugar don't worry about doing this i just did it because it was clumpy and 2 teaspoons or 5 grams of kosher salt give that some whiskey business until thoroughly combined then to that flour mix you're going to add one and a half cups or 323 grams of whole milk one whole egg and two and a half tablespoons or 28 grams of melted butter mix it until thoroughly combined and you should have a fairly loose batter now in a non-stick pan or on a flat top get a three to three and a half inch ring mold make sure to lightly grease the inside of your ring mold heat that over medium heat once it's nice and hot add about a tablespoon or 14 grams of unsalted butter let that melt in as soon as it bubbles place it on your pan and spoon in roughly three tablespoons of batter you don't want to fill this thing to the top because it's going to rise you really want wanna sort of a thin layer there take four to six maple balls and randomly place them on your batter poking them into the batter and then just let that cook for about two to three minutes until you get a nice brown bottom take the ring mold off flip your griddle cake and repeat on the other side and that's it that's your griddle cake once both sides are brown and it's cooked through it's done now that's one half so you're gonna need two of these per sandwich then just repeat with as many as you need this recipe makes about 10 to 14 of these now for consistency's sake if you have any brands i happen to have two iron brands of my initials jnw heat those bad boys over a high heat flame until very hot and just stamp my initials into the top bun you have the coveted mcgriddle cake you got the bacon now let's talk about that folded egg which is not complicated for each sandwich you'll only need one egg place it in a bowl season it to taste with salt and pepper if you wish whisk your egg until it's uniform in texture lightly butter a flat top or a non-stick skillet heat that over medium heat once the butter is nice and hot and bubbling pour your egg directly on the surface and using a spatula or an offset spatula spread it out into a six inch by six inch square you need to do this quickly don't let it cook all the way through once it's cooked about 75 percent of the way fold the right side of the egg over then the left side the top and then finally the bottom and now you've got a little folded square you can do that visually very easily immediately take it out of your pan the heat will carry over this way the egg doesn't overcook okay so we're ready now get your griddle kicks and heat those back up over a pan place one slice of cheddar cheese and one slice of pepper jack cheese on the bottom bun now you can let that sit with the cover until it melts or you can just you know torch it like me and flex now the assembly is very simple first bottom bun then your bacon which has been cut in half to fit appropriately about three half slices followed by your egg brush the inside part of your top bun with maple syrup and crown your king now that is a jw branded mcgriddle it's mcmuffin it's mcgriddle time if mcdonald's has their own little brand logo fine we can do that too we can do our own logo that's fine jw looks a lot better like a french omelet sort of the eggs cook perfectly it's not dry it's seasoned perfectly two kinds of cheeses the bacon is pretty sticky sort of fuel injection maple syrup that's got you like but got class now with all that said bring my friend in okay work with me at uchiko when i worked there i got you i got you baby okay start with number one you've been doing this long enough you like some water to cleanse the palette please sir the mystery that i'm shrouded in right now has me turned on alright so that was number one now number two oh right away number two yeah the seasoning just the general texture on everything like you can automatically pick up on the fact that number two has like way better texture to the mcgriddle aspect the first one was very chewy where the second one was really soft oh you can take this off by the way oh god it really is so astronomically different i actually was like thought you were just being nice but i just know i had the other one it's you get a completely different bite out of this feel every element in that sandwich whereas this one you just bite through it blindfolded with the mouthpiece got better and if there's anybody that is in questions as you want anybody that is in question there's only one winner and only one thing that i have to say is i think mcdonald's is going to be loving it this time but do you wanna know what else brands its own mcgriddle all right guys and that is it so we made the mcdonald's mcgriddle and we flexed at first i was a little worried right because i i felt like mine looked a little different this happens to me every time you eat it side by side and it just blows the other one out of the water and it really goes to show that we get so used to what something is like and not don't really question whether or not it's even really good we like it like you can like something to me so many fast foods are just they are what they are like when you get a burger from from insert fast food chain like that is what it is and it has been for years and people just accept that and they don't think twice about like wait a minute this kind of sucks or whatever um i don't know it's a little bit an epiphany moment i think i experienced that i think cam experienced that cam thank you for joining us i love you and people who are watching i love you i kiss you but most of all we're not gonna go beyond kissing okay social distancing that doesn't that doesn't make

272,272,How To EASILY Cook Fish Without Messing It Up,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cs1iH97sFpM/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLCpN8fipZu4CUm3CmXf55x_zbw04w,Cs1iH97sFpM,"9 minutes, 12 seconds","Cooking fish is something that easily intimidates people. That's exactly why I'm sharing how to make homemade fried, seared, and baked fish quickly and easily with the help of the Quicker Picker...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, okay it's time to break the cycle you want to cook fish but then you scare yourself uh it's too hard eh it's better at the restaurant no not anymore we're gonna work together to change that [Music] okay so this is a guide on how to cook fish across the board before we get to that i'm extremely excited to announce that this video is sponsored by bounty and uh drum roll please the quicker picker-upper [Music] who's helping me provide this quick and easy recipe for you spend less time cooking and cleaning and more time soaking up the sun with friends and family and the homies obviously we're gonna run through the three most basic ways to cook fish searing frying and well baking or roasting in that case there's a very specific way to do this there's a reason why restaurants have this nailed down right it's not a secret it's just a matter of paying attention and knowing what to do which we're gonna run through so with that said let's make this shall we i figured since the scariest one for most people is frying let's just rip the dang band-aid off and do it don't be scared so start by heating up two quarts of oil in a large heavy bottom pot something like a four to five quart pot to 350 degrees fahrenheit or 175 degrees celsius now let's get our breading station going to make your batter in a medium-sized bowl mix together one and a quarter cup or 190 grams of all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon or 9 grams of kosher salt 1 tablespoon or 7 grams of garlic powder and 1 tablespoon or 7 grams of smoked paprika whisk that together and then realize you didn't add the black pepper so also some fresh cracked black pepper whisk that again once thoroughly combined you're going to add one can of beer which is approximately 12 ounces or 354.882 grams then halfway through that also realize you forgot to add your egg real good josh glad to see all the fine dining work has helped so yeah one egg to all that whisk until all of your ingredients are thoroughly combined and now you've got your batter as for our le poisson of choice that's spanish for fish i'm joking it's french you'll need one to one and a half pounds of a really nice cod slice those into pieces however you want you can cut little fillets you can cut them into fish sticks just make sure that they're all cut evenly shaped because they're gonna cook differently now frying these is very very simple first you're just gonna toss into plain all-purpose flour i had like maybe two cups in here now toss your pieces of fish in the flour make sure to coat every little crevice and then sort of pat them between your hands to shake off the excess and reveal a beautifully dusted piece of fish then dunk your fish into your batter then carefully drop it into your oil dropping away from you unless you want that hot oil to splash in your dang face and then just fry that for about seven minutes or until golden brown and then just rinse and repeat with the rest it genuinely is that easy it doesn't require a whole lot of really fancy things now once you're done frying let me show you a little trick that you can use bounty paper towels with now you could just drain this on a wire rack but you'll get even crispier fish if you drain it directly on top of a paper towel so it absorbs the oil now while it's still hot and fresh out of the fryer make sure to season it immediately with kosher salt and optionally some togarashi then remove the paper towel and let it cool the rest of the way on a wire rack and that's it that's your beer battered fried fish but wait you can't just have beer batter fish without a nice horseradish cream which is just fancy chef talk for tartar sauce in a medium sized bowl combine half a cup or 115 grams of mayonnaise better be homemade half a cup 115 grams of sour cream 1 tablespoon or 10 grams of fresh grated horseradish when i say fresh grated i mean like the real stuff all right i cannot stress this enough big flavor you can also omit it if you don't have it half a bunch of chives that have been very finely sliced very finely you understand i'm tired of these thick cut chives it's yucky and one whole dill pickle finely diced and also the zest and the juice of one whole lemon finish with a little bit of salt and pepper to taste whisk all that together and well i mean well that's it that's the sauce now you get your crispy fish you got the sauce give a little dip and enjoy okay it's wide fish twine oh god beer battered no good thing i have the quicker picker upper if you're the type of person that just goes to restaurants and only eats fried fish but you never made it let this be your call so delicate so perfectly cooked and it's incredibly easy this is the kind of stuff that once you eat it it's got you talking infomercial call 1-800 this is really crispy and good thank you now let's talk about searing crispy skin fish squirting the skin works just fine to keep it flat but you can also do it without that i like to use a 10 inch stainless steel pan heat of about two and a half tablespoons or 35 grams of a high heat oil enough to coat the bottom of the pan nicely heat that over medium-high heat until extremely hot and nearly smoking season your fish fillet of choice with salt and pepper and any spices you want now lay your fish in the hot pan skin side down and immediately gently press down on the flesh so every square inch of the skin touches the pan keep holding it down until the most part of it adheres or it's nice and flat then just let that sear for 2-3 minutes or until the skin is nice and crisp you can see the cook on the fish coming halfway up its flesh and it loosens relatively easily work your spatula underneath carefully flip and sear an additional two to three minutes depending on its thickness you may need to cook it a little longer but i like a nice medium on most fish with the exception of salmon or tuna now pull that out of the pan and enjoy immediately the testament of a good cook listen carefully and this has been sitting for like 15 minutes because i had to take pictures and yet somehow the simple seared just oil salt pepper is easily my favorite out of all three of these some i die last let's talk about the obligatory but still yummy crusted salmon so you're gonna want to stir with four salmon fillets i actually prefer to cut my own fillets by hand but wait notice how the board is just going everywhere brother and if you're working with sharp knives you need to secure your board now here's a cool little trick with bounty take a couple strips of paper towels dampen them with some water and lay them nice and flat where your board's gonna go lay your board on top press to adhere and now look at that it actually does work really well it's kind of shocking like i said i cut my own fish fillet from a two pound side of salmon it's just you know you can control the size more yeah it's better this is king salmon get those lined up on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and let's make our topping for the glue that's gonna hold the crunchy mix together a quarter cup or 60 grams of mayonnaise two and a half tablespoons or 35 grams of whole grain mustard and three cloves of fresh grated garlic also a generous amount of salt mix that together until thoroughly combined and well that's it also if you want to get extra bougie you can add a little bit of fresh grated black truffle but you know to flex or not to flex that is the question now because i'm trying to look out for the homies i did make the crunchy topping gluten-free so to make that simply combine crushed nuts consisting of half a cup or 45 grams of toasted walnuts and half a cup or 45 grams of toasted pecans followed by half a cup or 40 grams of fresh grated parmigiano-reggiano like the good stuff a small handful of chopped fresh parsley salt and pepper to taste mix that together until thoroughly combined and we're ready to roll now take your salmon fillets season each of them on all sides lightly with salt and brush them with a generous portion of your garlicky mustard mayo stuff and then sprinkle on a generous amount of your crunchy cheesy nut topping nice once all your pieces of fish are ready place them in an oven that's been set to 425 degrees fahrenheit for 10 to 15 minutes or until cooked to a nice medium rare now i know some people like it medium cook it to your liking all right i don't hear people complaining and that's it that's crusted fish obviously i put truffle in the crust so it's extra yummy yummy it's easy to put together it's gluten free it's healthy what more do you want i'm appealing all crowds right now but do you want to know what else is pleasing all crowds b-roll [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made multiple kinds of fish not in my face they all turned out absolutely perfect thank you again to bounty for sponsoring this video for providing 10 million meals to feeding america stay tuned for next week because i will be bringing you another special using the help of the quicker picker upper aka bounty hotel and i also like to call them people uh also we're back in the cabinet a lot of people were not happy being in the pantry which i was kind of

That's why I created this video. It is a true homemade Banana Fudge Sundae recipe vs. homemade bananas foster...,2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, bananas and ice cream go together like pancakes and syrup eggs and bacon you get the point but today we need to decide between two of the best and back by popular demand to do that is my mom we're back [Music] okay so but like I said bananas and ice cream it's just one of those weird combinations that go so perfectly together my mom's favorite banana fudge sundae that's always been what she's gotten and then for me I'm in-between either a banana fudge sundae or Bananas Foster and I thought you know what we need to do why do just one when we can do both go head-to-head and decide which is the best before anybody complaints I know there is an echo okay you don't need to remind me it's here it's there we're gonna correct it so in the meantime just just just take a little body your ice cream food you just let's do it on this show we usually say let's do this shall we okay so first let's start with my mom's favorite which we'll begin by making our ultra thick fudge sauce not to do that in a medium-sized saucepan you're gonna combine 2 cups or 500 grams of heavy cream a quarter cup or 56 grams of salted butter 1/2 a cup of 115 grams of granulated sugar 3/4 of a cup or 150 grams of dark brown sugar give that some whiskey business then just bring that to a light simmer over medium heat simmer that for about a minute no boiling please then whisk in 3 ounces or 85 grams of very finely chopped chocolate keep whisking until it's completely melted and dissolved that's kind of redundant huh then remove it from the heat and add one cup or 110 grams of Dutch process cocoa make sure that those Dutch people will really process the cocoa then return them to a very low simmer over low heat until thick and glossy which will take about 30 seconds then again removed from the heat whisk in 2 teaspoons or 9 grams of vanilla extract and voila you've got a nice salted butter fudge sauce now if it's clumpy at all you can always just strain it through a fine mesh strainer and you'll get a nice smooth sauce but either way it's gonna be tasty don't you worry now before we put this together if you're gonna add nuts please roast them from fresh it's very simple here we have some hazelnuts which we put on a baking sheet and roasted at around 375 Fahrenheit for about 10 minutes we're until nice and golden brown cool them and crush them to your liking from here assembly is super basic you'll obviously need vanilla ice cream and bananas for both of these recipes but I suggest making your own vanilla ice cream you can use my ice cream base and just replace the coffee with some vanilla beans the link is in the description for that if you want to go that route - anyway you're gonna get nice long boys serving bold type things start by scooping some beautifully perfectly round lump of ice cream followed by a banana that has been beautifully sliced in half lengthwise please on either side then some of your chuckle yum-yum the sighs sorry about that some of your nuts and finally some nice little quenelle shaped dollops of whipped cream a lot of folks like to use Martian on cherries on this but obviously we have to class it up and use some looks our dough cherries instead now that is a proper fudge sundae now let's go in on this hoe my mom first a little bit of extra fudge sauce little bit you know did a lot a lot a little bit become do you want some fudge so banana fudge sundae it's a classic combination although my mom said she doesn't like nuts and I put them on here anyway you want to go for it because I'm the baby so I just looking good this is a level up this is not the same as the favor this is not like we're going to Baskin and Robbins by the way but better coming soon you got Luxardo cherries all right this is cocktail chemistry Ultra works if you're getting your sundaes without extra fudge we're wrong with a little oh no just what it was a classy 25 cents food cost wise get out of here that's looks our dough chariot right Wow it's a cover of Shido cherry but like with actual class just like this sundae so Bananas Foster is actually surprisingly easy as well you know first start by taking a widow stick of cinnamon and charring it lightly like so you can also use a gas flame or a blowtorch or you can also just not chart and I won't be mad at you isn't it now on a 12-inch skillet tossed in a quarter cup or 56 grams of unsalted butter 1/2 a cup plus 1 tablespoon or 117 grams of dark brown sugar half a teaspoon or 1 gram of fine sea salt and your cinnamon stick he fed over medium heat stirring occasionally until melted and homogeneous and it begins to lightly bubble then don't forget to switch the spot you're filming in because you want to show off the new stove not a flex but I am very excited to finally have gas after years of electric now from here you want to try to avoid stirring too much otherwise you risk sugar crystals forming which you know is an ideal now while that's bubbling add three whole bananas which have been halved wise and then halved in their center so you get these little funny-looking shapes place them in your pants spaced evenly apart let that simmer undisturbed for about three minutes over medium heat then flip once and once only and repeat for an additional two to three minutes or until the bananas are lightly browned on both sides again don't flip multiple times or else they're gonna get really yucky then increase our heat slightly and add in 1/3 a cup or 70 grams of a nice high proof good quality rum it should simmer immediately now from there you're gonna very very carefully ignite the steam that is rising for the pan you can use a match you can use a lighter or a blowtorch then it will erupt in a beautiful flambe flame now maintain that heat continue to simmer and flambe until the flame dies out ideally try and baste it with the camel make sure Wald's flambe now listen please be careful when doing this is perfectly safe to do when done properly Papa wants you to be healthy and easy anyway once the flame goes out you should have beautifully flambéed bananas now all you got to do is get yourself a nice scoop of ice cream layer on your bananas and some of that lovely rum sauce and get ready to get sent to rum banana pajama town [Music] all right that's the size that's gonna go em hmm Bananas Foster this is the ultimate classic and if you do it right do me a favor don't burn down your house you got the smell of caramelized sugar brown butter rum a little melty oh my god I was gonna do like a which is better kind of thing but they're so good in their own way that rum really it comes through it does it gives it a wonderful flavor I like it do you think that there's one better than the other I think everything in cooking has to do with personal preference my opinion I genuinely think that that the the fudge sundae works better this is rich and it's delicious but the fudge sundae is so balanced whether you're a Bananas Foster lover or chocolate fudge sundae lover all banana ice cream desserts are our friends I kiss you and I live Thank You sway let me choose but do you want to know what else is full of banana pajamas [Music] alright guys and that is it so we made Bananas Foster we made but just like you've laughing why are you better Frank the hill in frame got dammit the banana fudge sundae was the clear winner in this one I actually didn't expect that to happen because I really feel like rum caramel bananas it's like what that's another whole combination I guess it really comes down to personal preference but for me right now while it's hot fudge sundae just satisfies in a very very special way and so I understand why that's your favorite thing I think I think we did a good job so mom thank you for joining us again today everyone who loves you so anyway if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and I will see you next [Music] you [Music]

sea salt give that some whiskey business because you keep forcing me to say it for some reason now get a stand mixer set up with the pedal attachment by the way if you don't have a stand mixer you can do it without one just you know use your hands people get so petty about this like yay then don't use one anyway add in half your flour mixture turn your stand mixture on medium low then while mixing add in your yeasty water mixture yummy sounding along with 3 tablespoons or 30 grams of good extra virgin olive oil then just continue to mix that over medium low speed until thoroughly combined switch to a dough hook attachment then add the rest of your flour mixture and continue to mix and knead until smooth and elastic about two to three more minutes once your little man is nice and smooth lightly grease a medium-sized bowl with olive oil shape your dough into a shape your book shake shape your dough into a nice smooth ball plop your ball into your bowl cover with lightly greased plastic wrap or a damp towel and please don't forget to give it a smiley face heart it helps it helps trust me [Music] he's very cute and let it rise at room temperature for about an hour or until doubled now once your little man is now a big plump boy lightly flower work surface give a little kiss little pat and punch it down and dump your dough out then divide your dough into 12 even pieces or for the intellectuals out there 55 to 60 grams per piece i'm just kidding you could still be an intellectual and not use a scale it just makes me angry then just let those pieces rest for about five minutes covered with a damp towel or your plastic wrap now once those have rested you're then going to take each individual piece and you'll notice that i sort of punched them out into little rectangles that helps a lot in this process you're just gonna take your piece and roll it on your board while slowly bringing your hands outward to create a long rope around nine inches long as you get towards the end i want you to apply a little more pressure to get sort of a torpedo shape now the torpedo shape is optional but come on look how classy that looks then just repeat with the rest of your pieces of dough place them all on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper spaced at least an inch apart you may need two baking sheets for this then just cover those with a damp towel or lightly greased plastic wrap and let them sit at room temperature for 45 more minutes to proof once they're done proofing carefully remove your towels and place them in an oven set to 425 degrees fahrenheit or 220 degrees celsius for 13 minutes or until beautifully golden brown now wait as those are baking we need to make a special topping to make this in a small pot you're going to add a quarter cup or 56 grams of unsalted butter place that over medium heat and simply melt that just until the butter begins to foam and very lightly browns take it off the heat and grate two to three large cloves of garlic do not cook the garlic in there we just want a light suggestion of garlic let that sit for about 30 seconds and then immediately strain the garlic out so you have a lightly garlic flavored butter now remove your beautiful breadsticks and immediately brush them generously with your lightly brown garlic butter hit them with a generous amount of flaky salt okay they look a little pretzel-like but that's okay because i don't know no there's left to do is give a little taste test and see who the winner is you gotta warm them up brother mine yucky poopy party eew poopy let's get a new one huh there we go that one looks like i already messed it up but it just came like that what's the difference assuming this is how they heat theirs up and surely they're not are they baking them these breadsticks are shaking in their foil we already have the other ones so we're going to start with mine first off the second you bite into this it's like got the crunch of the flaky salt the exterior is crisp almost like a like a focaccia but the inside is airy weighs nothing it feels like it's gonna no please instead of floating away it floats right my verdict is we won easily this is vikram he's normally behind the camera but today because kate here right now but we don't have a blindfold because i don't know where they are so but i did just get this new room keep your eyes closed if you can yeah it's pretty hot how hot do you think you put that in your mouth i put this in my mouth so that's uh that would be number uno it's okay take your time stick number two don't burn yourself so one or two i'm gonna go with two i don't know which was which my immediate comments are the first one was more more dry it was just kind of just bread flavoring the second one i could taste the salt it's a lot softer to me there was also more flavor in it i don't know what the flavor was um well mine was actually number one so no i'm just joking mine was number two you can't wait to get fired i've never had olive garden breadsticks before so i didn't know what to expect honestly like i don't i don't see the hype over these i'm gonna keep it real when you actually like look at them and eat them side by side like back and forth back forth you start to realize like it's like this sucks you heard it here even vikram with his big boy hat on says that we won but better episode 12 12. he won okay that's it that's all i got to say but do you want to know what else is family when you're here i've skipped b-roll last time i'm sorry it was a social experiment [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made olive garden breadsticks it wasn't it wasn't that hard to to beat him to be honest with you sorry sorry sorry about it but like it was kind of easy it's just a solid recipe it really changed my mind on how i feel about breadsticks perfect vehicle for dipping sauces you can use this to accompany so many different things other than just a marinara sauce so everyone on instagram is super stoked about the new place i'm super stoked about the new place but with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see

Solid homemade...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, weights like Baconator Terminator is that are they like affiliated or look the point is if anything's gonna be terminated today it's not gonna be us [Music] [Music] two but better we're on another American classic the Wendy's Baconator this is very special to a lot of people and I and I understand that and I respect that and please understand that me shuffling their grave for them is with love it's a pretty straightforward it's burger and that's it it's burger patties cheese bacon and ketchup a male that's literally it it's I think it's gonna be easy to beat but I'm trying to say so without postponing this anymore let's make this shall we is that their slogan to all of you is our recipe quality cannot be a recipe a recipe is like a body of text that includes both directions and a list of ingredients there's a breakfast Baconator now whoa there's a Baconator but then there's also a son of a Baconator what is the difference sorry what's what's the difference between the regular Baconator in the son of a Baconator she didn't lusts to regular bacon ears and one son of a Baconator thank you we've got oh that's wrong the bag so this is the regular Baconator it's like that I hate that they are square patties Wow are they square I read somewhere that they do it so that you can see the meat like the quality of the meat I don't want to see they're out of all the burgers I've had this is like bottom of the barrel first off the bottom bun is soaked in grease I mean like that is how much grease is in the bottom bun they say quality you can taste but I think it's about time they taste my quality so as usual if we're gonna flicks on a fast-food burger we need to make our own buns this is a variation of my Hokkaido milk bread recipe so start by combining two tablespoons or 20 grams of bread flour two tablespoons sort of 27 grams of water and four tablespoons or 60 grams of whole milk into a small saucepan mix that together thoroughly heat over medium heat and continue stirring constantly until this turns altra thick key in he likes oh now just remove mr. thickens from the heat in a separate bowl and let it sit till room temperature separately you're gonna dissolve one tablespoon or nine grams of active dry yeast into half a cup or 120 grams of lukewarm whole milk and when I say lukewarm I mean 95 degrees Fahrenheit or 35 degrees Celsius then just let that sit at room temp for 10 minutes once your thickened mixture is cool and your yeast is bloomed in the bowl of a stand mixer you're gonna combine two and a half cups or 320 grams of bread flour 1 and 1/4 tablespoon or 17 grams of granulated sugar and 1 teaspoon or 7 grams of fine sea salt you've got some V Skippy's nice trying out some new accents as you can see pop it in your stand mixer with the dough hook attachment and set it to speed to medium low well that's mixing add one whole egg plus one egg yolk and your yeasty milk continue to mix until it forms a nice dough and look if it's a little too dry just add a tablespoon or so more of whole milk then just look that mix for about four minutes we're taking a nice smooth elastic dough then I had three tablespoons or 42 grams of softened unsalted butter be sure to add it one tablespoon at a time to give it time to you know incorporate once all the butters incorporated let that brother mix for another minute or two until smooth then just pop it out of your stand mixer bowl like a newborn baby roll it into a taut ball and place it in a lightly greased pole then just cover with plastic wrap or a moist towel and let it rise at room temp for one to two hours or until doubled then deceptively caress it and beat it down you don't have to use a pumpkin it could just be your hand then simply divide it evenly into six pieces now if you're a true intellectual you'll weight each piece at around 95 to 105 grams each take each piece and form it into a ball by pulling in all the sides to the center flipping it over so the seam side faces down and roll it in circles with your hand staying in contact with the bench till you get a tight widow ball transfer that to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and repeat this with the rest make sure to space them apart evenly otherwise gonna be very sad when these rise then just cover that with another rimmed baking sheet and let them proof at room temperature for 30 minutes [Laughter] now once your balls have rested give them a light brushing of egg wash consisting of one egg plus a small splash of water may twist together be sure to coat the total surface area don't miss a single spot then just pop those bad boys in the oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit or 190 degrees Celsius ideally with a convection setting if you have one for 15 to 18 minutes or until the most beautiful golden-brown balls greet you out of the oven brush each of them lightly with melted butter and let them cool on a wire rack I mean look these buns alone are already winning now let's talk about beef they say fresh never frozen but what about fresh ground what about that what about fresh ground big boy the grind never stops all right of course you don't have to do this but if you do I'll give you a kiss and also you'll want one pound or 450 grams of short rib half a pound or 225 grams of sirloin and one pound or 450 grams of chuck roast then just cut those into pieces that will fit into your grinders hole toss them together and well um you know run them through your meat grinder now look the best part here is if you have a stand mixer you could absolutely just use an attachment grinder which I'll link the one that I use in the description now look at all this gorgeous ground beef I mean really it is worthy of a Men's Fitness cover because it's so beefy and beautiful now we're ready to make a burger so make sure you have thick cut nice smoky bacon fried until crispy or however you like it you Josh crispy bacon is wrong yeah you know what teach their own right whatever makes you happy and sets your soul on fire okay Papa says it's okay additionally if you want to step up your Mayo you can make a black garlic chive mayo like the one I have here by simply combining half a bunch of chives that have been very very thinly sliced and three to four cloves of black garlic that have been crushed and paste if I'd you can use the flat side of your knife you do that by the way it should be soft enough then just mix it with half a cup of mayonnaise some salt and pepper to taste and maybe a little splash of Chinese black vinegar if you want to get a little fancy bing-bang-boom vamsee Mayo now last but not least is the famous square patty now look there's a there's a crazy secret to this right we're gonna take some beef and you're just going to form it into a square that's it okay make it in accordance to the dimensions of your bum you're gonna want to quarter-pound patties totaling out a half a pound for one burger or more you know it's up to you season your patties on both sides generously with salt and any additional spices you want place them in a heavy bottomed pan that's been preheated over medium heat until ripping hot I want it to sizzle wanted to pop you know what I mean then just shoot that over medium-high heat for two to three minutes until you get some nice browning and crust and I want this to be deeply browned okay no gray meat repeat on the other side your burger is cooked - you're like this should have a high enough fat content that a well-done burger is still pretty good then just add the cheese of your choice I used a mix of cheddar and smoked provolone now while your pain is still ripping hot leave it on and just add a small little splash of water and immediately cover with foil and let that steam melt the cheese now of course you could also use a blowtorch but you know not everybody has to be extra like me to assemble your burgers be sure to first toast your buns okay slice them in half toasted on butter until beautifully toasted want that crotch on the inside and a generous spoonful of your mail little squirt of tomato ketchup followed by your burger patty two to three slices of bacon another burger patty another two to three slices of bacon your fancy boy mail and another little weird pattern squirt of ketchup followed by your other bun now this is obviously a very American burger but there's something so special about this combo which we're about to find out you know all I gotta say is this burger is so artisanal first off fatty fat did and fatter than that the patties are square which make absolutely no difference thank you very much we won thank you that's the end bye-bye this is like the michelin-starred French Laundry and then this is kind of just like that Italy trying to fly away because it's embedded the bun automatic win and this only sat in the car for maybe max five minutes okay this has been sitting for at least ten minutes and you can see where it's soaked through it stops okay still has that punchy charred beef flavor you guys are all week [Music] so we're gonna bring somebody in okay get this time to have a little bit of taste burger number one you need to drink some water yeah I do I hear you go drink some water you're still chewing on it burger number two here's my answers burger number one was terrible I actually wanted to spit it out the entire time burger number two is really good because I felt as though I had a lot more flavor you can taste the bacon the bunny was a lot you're not much of a burger fan though I hate burgers the lesser of two evils we won but better episode 11 wendy's whether you're a burger eater or not this is quality you can taste or guys and that is it so we made the Baconator and I think we done gun terminated the bacon name in the world of a burger it's really not that revolutionary in flavor texture knee it's just it's just a bacon cheeseburger with ketchup and mayonnaise that's all it is we just made a way better version with higher quality ingredients in yada-yada so on and so forth easy so probably by now you were expecting to be in our new kitchen I swear I'm not doing this to tease you I'm filming this way ahead of time because the move and it's busy and so this message is from the past to the future you are them in the next video you should see me in the new kitchen

so many good moments in that kitchen and literally we grew from almost no subs to two million in that kitchen so Miguel is asking why I left the restaurant industry to create a YouTube channel there

in the industry and maybe that means that there will be restaurant one day anyway let's make this shall we this is not ripe okay so before we make our chicky chicky parm parm we must first make a delicious sauce yes sir with three to four slices of thick-cut bacon or pancetta slice that into half-inch wide pieces segments Lauren's toss them in a cold medium-size skillet place it over a medium heat along with two and a half tablespoons or 40 milliliters of good olive oil stirring often and once your bacon begins to develop some nice color and it gets close to the crispy zone yeah that's right I said it normally you're gonna add two red Fresno or Thai chilies sliced very thinly one teaspoon or two grams of red pepper flakes and five cloves of garlic thinly sliced now continue cooking that over medium heat until everything begins to toast and I'm talking like crispy bacon crispy garlic you get the point carefully scoop out all the solids believe the oil behind place them on a

really simple don't overcomplicate it toss a chicken breast in the flour shaking the excess off dip it to coat thoroughly in the egg wash now look sometimes the flour gets a little weird make sure that all the flour gets hydrated no old dry spots then drop it into your panko bread crumbs only to realize that the bowl you got was a little small so it's kind of annoying but whatever now make sure to coat it thoroughly in the breadcrumbs it's very very important press aggressively so that every single crevice is filled with bread crumbs place it to the side and repeat with the rest of your chicken breasts okay so to fry your chicken permission it's easier than you think don't worry Papa's gotcha you're gonna need a large deep pan a 12-inch cast-iron skillet is perfect for this fill it

With just a little bit of patience, you can feel like a sushi master at home, with your very own homemade hand rolls. Just...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, sushi is a very coveted very special thing you don't fudge with it i'm thinking to myself what is the easiest yet most proper way that we can make it at home and i thought hand rolls and with a little bit of help we'll get you guys as close as possible to one of the greatest bites of sushi you'll ever have [Music] okay so like i said sushi is very very coveted making the rice alone is a very very involved process it's not something you mess with attention to detail but in my opinion as long as people just have some backbone when they make their rice then most people can make beautiful sushi rice we'll be bringing on an old sushi chef friend of mine from the last restaurant that i worked at i think now with all that said let's make this shall we okay so obviously sushi rice is the most important component but before we make that we must first make something called sushi zoo which is what you season the rice with start with a small saucepan and add one cup or 240 milliliters of rice vinegar a single two inch square of kombu three tablespoons or 45 grams of granulated sugar and one tablespoon plus one teaspoon or 12 grams of kosher salt now just heat that until it's a steamy boy and the sugar's dissolved but do not boil this otherwise then take it off the heat and let it sit for about 10 to 15 minutes strain it through a fine mesh sieve and fish out that their combo you don't want that no more and well that's it sushi zoo an old friend of mine a sushi chef angela what is up dude how are you i'm so good so good how are you i'm excellent you know so we're gonna jump right into it i've got the rice i've got the tamaki gold so for sushi rice i think a short grain rice because of the plumpness that the rice will get you're gonna have a bowl of rice and you're gonna have a bowl of water and then your your rice and then pull it out and then do it again do that three times so three times no more yeah three times no more my mom used to beat my ass i'm talking like she pulls out one of these yeah exactly so for the most part angela suggests a one-to-one ratio of rice to water so i've got two cups of rice and two cups of water put the rice in the rice cooker pot cover with the water and set it in your rice cooker then let it sit and soak in that water for 15 minutes prior to cooking once the rice starts to absorb that water it will start to get split it'll start to come brittle so you want to move pretty quickly throughout this process wait do i just click start and that's it yeah that's it oh okay here we go it made the beeping noise so i'm gonna say it's okay very good give it a little pat for good luck there we go okay it's all out it's all in the center pour the sushi zoo over the rice paddle for every two cups of dry rice you'll need half a cup of sushi zoo but obviously taste your rice as you go make one little stream and then start from the furthest away from you and then move it closer towards you it hits the paddles and disperses all the way across the race across over the middle i'm almost out of zoo let's go ahead and cut them you're going wider strokes and what you're going to try to do is not hit the rice you want to you want to gently pick the rice up and fling it toward the outside that's going to be part of the cooling process as well as spreading the future oh okay okay i see you can go ahead and start piling it back into the middle that that's a little easier yep and so right back into the middle and then you're gonna one more time okay so i've cut it again no clumps this rice actually looks pretty good you should look for it the shiny you are ready to go back okay so i got the towel it's damp you're going to go around the top of the uh hon giddy this is so this is so awkward cross your body cross your body so like this essentially yes oh okay now now it's coming up i got it i got it so okay so it's all in one spot go ahead and lay the towel over and gather from under and then uh put it inside the right spot you scoop them under your bottom side there you go oh that was that was actually really easy in the warmer keep warm well thank you so much angela i appreciate you thank you thank you so much for setting this up and doing it bye we've got a rice now it's time to get our fillings prepared okay so we're gonna make that spicy mayo that all the sushi restaurants have you know what i'm talking about so you're gonna start with two thirds of a cup or 150 grams of cupid mayo one tablespoon or 20 grams of the most overused sauce of all time sriracha two teaspoons for 12 grams of gochujang one tablespoon or nine grams of chili oil solids just the solids at the bottom one thinly sliced green onion salted taste and a couple of drops of sesame oil and there you go oh you can also add a couple cloves of grated garlic if you want whatever now the style tamaki that we're going to be rolling requires half cut sheets of noise take your sheets of nori cut them in half get it as even as possible please and each half will be well a hand roll now if you're going to be cutting cucumbers at all for this in the last restaurant that i worked at this is something that i've been yelled at and that i've yelled at other people for so make sure you cut your cucumber into segments the same width as your nori cheek them boys like so about a half an inch thick you've got all these cheeks yeah no no no jokes to be made here all right now we need to cut them into even sticks so lay them flat side down and cut across make sure to secure your board so they get perfect little rectangles rectangular prisms maybe they're about half an inch thick perfectly even this is the type of stuff that line cooks and prep cooks flex with okay so let's start with spicy tuna first you're gonna need sashimi grade tuna make sure to not use any just anything then cut your beautiful piece of fish into small half inch cubes ideally you want a knife sharp enough so you can slice this with one single stroke no sawing ideally but it's spicy tuna so if it gets broken up that's fine place it in a bowl with one thinly sliced green onion a generous amount of the spicy mayo that you made earlier i did about three tablespoons optionally a little sprinkling of furakake yeah i know haha kake soy sauce to taste give it a little mix and then remember that you totally forgot to add a tablespoon and a half of sriracha and end up squeezing it too hard because you were mad mix it back up and there you go make sure to give it a little taste to make sure it's good to assemble your spicy cheetah hand roll wet your hands lightly with water take a small handful of sushi rice and place it on the bottom half of your half sheet of nori spread that bad boy out so it reaches a little over halfway up the nori add a heaping spoonful of your spicy tuna followed by cucumber stick thinly sliced green onion and toasted sesame seeds roll that little brother up nice and tight don't be scared daddy's got you top one of those ends with a little extra sesame seed and green onion now look these tamaki are meant to be eaten immediately while the nori is still crispy so put that bad boy in your mouth oh my god one thing i want to note that crunch i know you heard it i know you heard it i prefer this way rolling tamaki because it stays with me yeah if you're a fan of raw fish spicy tuna this is the way to go this is i mean i could i could be in a sushi bar right now now let's say you want to go a little more fancy and off the cuff get some king crab legs i got a little cluster here separate out the meat carefully also by the way a little trick you can do to separate the crab without breaking it is to snap at the joints make sure there's a good exit pathway you know there's nothing in the way you've opened it up nicely and then tap out a piece of meat like so it requires some force then just make sure to remove any feather bones in the meat now separately add half a cup or 115 grams of unsalted butter to a small saucepan set over medium heat now while that's melting place a small handful of bonito flakes in some cheesecloth wrap it and tie the cheesecloth together to create a sort of a little bonito tea bag place it in your butter and continue to heat the butter until it browns as deeply as possible without burning it then immediately remove it from the heat when you're ready to make your roll place your crabmeat in the butter just until it's hot we don't want to fryer cook it we're just getting it hot then get a piece of nori prepped with rice place on a quarter or an eighth of an avocado along with an appropriately sized piece of crab meat i like it thick brush it with additional brown butter hit it with some flaky salt roll it up and optionally add a little dollop of caviar on the end of it bougie yet classic money what do you want me to say it's a it's a tamaki roll with crab brown butter caviar avocado to make a long story short this is single-handedly one of the greatest tamaki rolls i've ever put in my mouth next one for a vegetarian with the brown rice option we're not using brown rice that's a kanye west line you can absolutely just take some mushrooms of your choice sear them up in a pan get some nice color on them add a splash of soy sauce and mirror into the pan to create a little bit of a glaze really get them nice and colored you know you want them glazed then place them on a prepped piece of nori with a piece of avocado brush your avocado lightly with a dark soy sauce and a mixture of equal parts thai basil mint and cilantro maybe some micro greens you know for vitamins and because it looks mad pretty roll it up and feel zen after one bite this one is for the vegetarians other you get you know i get a lot of requests for this a lot cheers to you rice with no meat or protein if i got this at a restaurant i wouldn't be mad i feel like i always surprise myself when i make vegetarian food i expect it to be like blase boring no flavor sorry vegetarians the thing is is when you really sit down and make it and you take the the time and the care to make something nicely it doesn't matter if it's vegetarian vegan not vegan vegetable whatever it it's just something that was made with care so okay i get this is a lot of info but don't be daunted take it slow enjoy yourself maybe make it with your friends with respect to social distancing and eat until you hate yourself but do you want to know what else you can eat until you hate yourself b-roll all right guys and that is it so we made tamaki aka hand rolls huge thank you to angela for showing us the technique of making rice she has worked years of her life multiple years she fast-tracked all y'all second off gabe thank you for donating temporarily your han giddy wouldn't have been the same without it i've been waiting for mine forever hopefully it gets here soon anyway tamaki again honestly once you got the rice down everything else is very very very easy if that makes sense um within reason now with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] no

I'm talking homemade muffuletta bread, homemade giardiniera, and a beautiful olive salad to boot. It's basically...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, I know that I make a lot of thick jokes alright everyone's like Josh says thick too much thickness thick that thick thick thick okay fine you're right but this sandwich is mad [Music] okay so today we're talking about muffled lettuce sandwiches the muffuletta dude for one I just want to say that this recipe has the babish seal of approval so babish love you kissing so this sandwich is sort of like an Italian Louisiana thing supposedly Italian immigrants brought this to New Orleans and this is like a really popular sandwich it's got all sorts of different things and it's supposed to be humongous so with all that said let's make this shall we okay so despite preemptively drinking at an hour that I'd rather not describe gonna start with 3/4 of a cup plus one tablespoon are 195 milliliters of water at around 95 degrees Fahrenheit to that you're gonna add 2 teaspoons or six grams of instant yeast mix that together and just let that sit for about 10 minutes in a medium sized bowl mix together 2 and 3/4 of a cup or 415 grams of bread flour one and a half teaspoons or 7 grams of fine sea salt and 1 tablespoon or 14 grams of granulated sugar give that some whiskey business toss it in a big old stand mixer make sure to have the spiral hook thingy now to the flour mixture go ahead and add 2 tablespoons or 23 grams of lard or shortening you can add it at this point it's fine let it mix just a little bit to get incorporating it'll get a little crumbly then add in your yeast D water mixture at some times and let that mix on medium low speed for about 5 to 6 minutes or until you get a nice smooth dough like this shake that brother into a ball pop him into a greased bowl cover with plastic wrap and let that rise at room temperature for about an hour or until nice and doubled and thick eat like this and as usual give it some love some kisses whatever whatever feels nice and then beat it down slap it around D gasps that big dump it out onto a lightly floured work surface shape it into a rough ball but be careful here we don't want to get it in too tight because then you're gonna end up with a giant burger bun and let's just say that I might have shaped it a little too tight so the idea is you sort of want a thick disc then just place your forbidden disc onto a parchment lined baking sheet cover it with a damp towel and let it proof for 30 minutes at room temperature then remove your towel to reveal a grown-up forbidden disc now from here it's very simple give it a light brushing of egg wash consisting of one egg plus one tablespoon of water sprinkle it with some sesame seeds then you're gonna place it into an oven that's set to 450 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes but for the first five minutes place an oven-safe pan with a small layer of simmering water in it that's the steam you need then after that 5 minutes remove the pan let it bake another 5 minutes at 450 then drop the temperature to 375 for an additional 20 minutes or until you get a beautiful golden brown now look this one looks a little bit like a giant hamburger bun because it wasn't quite shaped thin enough so just make sure to push it down a little bit let it cool to room temperature before we go all crazy making our sandwich we need to start with an easy Jordyn era essentially Italian pickles don't be skewed it's really easy so in a medium sized pot go ahead and add 1 quart or 950 milliliters of white vinegar 1 cup or 240 milliliters of water also added a little splash of yuzu vinegar but you don't to be fancy like me if you don't want to 1 tablespoon err 10 grams of kosher salt 2 bay leaves 1 tablespoon or 9 grams of coriander seeds and 1 teaspoon or two grams of grains of paradise both of which work toasted then just bring that up to a light simmer and to that you're gonna add five ribs of sliced celery half a head of cauliflower florets 6 coarsely chopped carrots and two thinly sliced red Fresno chilies let that simmer for 6 to 8 minutes or just until the vegetable begins to soften a little bit can we still want this ultra al dente scoop the veggies into an appropriately sized jar at 1 tablespoon or 5 grams of finely chopped fresh oregano and cover with the pickling liquid make sure that there's enough vinegar to cover if there's not you know a splash of little in there to cover it all right nobody's gonna know then just let that sit until it comes to room temperature this makes a lot of pickles so you can have this recipe if you want to see you everything in Josh broth I've got the bread I've got the Jordan Nero how do I make this proper my apologies to the English now you can't have a great muffuletta without a great olive salad mix together 3/4 of a cup or 165 grams of rough chopped black olives 1 cup 100 90 grams of rough drop 1 Cup 190 grams of roughly 1 cup 190 grams of rough chopped hitted Castelvetrano olives Jesus that is a tongue twister have a cup our 60 grams of rough chopped dry cured olives the really chewy salty boys 1 tablespoon her 5 grams of fine chopped fresh oregano 1 finely diced shallot 3 cloves of garlic grated we're almost there 2 large handfuls of giardiniera rough chop at 2 by the way 3 finely diced Thai chilies and finally 2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters of sherry vinegar 1/4 cup or 60 mils of extra virgin olive oil and salt and pepper to taste give that a little he makes until you've got a beautiful olive salad now look you can let this marinate overnight but you could also use it right away okay it's time for all your hard work to pay off obviously slice your muffuletta bread in half I like to toast it in a 50/50 mix of olive oil and butter then I just give it a nice generous brushing of garlic oil which is just three tablespoons of olive oil and two garlic cloves grated into that that's literally it the layering order is very important begin with a generous layer of olive salad then a few slices of nice ham here I have some Prague smoked ham a few good slices of nice Swiss cheese and make sure you're covering the total surface area for the most part a generous amount of sliced Genoa salami a few slices of smoked provolone and by the way the number of slices is up to you just be aware that I did build this sandwich a bit tall so and finally top it with a few slices of excellent mortadella the best you can find then top with another layer of olive salad restructure your sandwich coz you got a little - buckwild on that though your meat slices and finally crown your king drawn quarter or ate your sandwich let us begin our extraordinary sandwich feast it's muffuletta time ultra ve this sandwich is the definition of thickness okay not one not two not three not even four C's I'm talking 43.5 C's if it's not difficult to put in your mouth it ain't a month one without further to do oh I'm in this sandwich zone I know this sandwich is easily the king of all Italian style sandwiches in my opinion made okay well there's a couple other ones but all the time spent collectively bringing it together to bring this perfectly balanced and you've got the saltiness from all the cured meats you've got some richness and some creaminess from the cheese funky salami fatty mortadella salty smoky ham and then you've got the acidic sort of a little bit spicy olive salad and that olive oils like crunched in there this is frickin that's gross sandwich this is like a third date sandwich very balanced finds a little fatty but do you want to know what else is a little bit fat D [Music] all right guys and that is it so we made the muffuletta sandwich the ma-at sandwich just because it's difficult to put in your mouth doesn't mean you shouldn't put it in your mouth and that's all I have to say about this sandwich it is extremely good it's so satisfying so everything that you want that has all those like sort of Italian sandwich flavors it's very it's it's it's a beautiful sandwich this is from me to you you don't want it okay but anyway if you enjoyed this video or you learned stuff didn't leave a like subscribe and I will see you next time [Music]

Whataburger Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit, you're in for an overhaul... Welcome back to episode...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, okay you're never gonna believe this I alluded that I was gonna do this on Instagram take a look at this this is the first time that a company has ever reached out to us and an expressed interest but I created this series for a very specific reason we're not changing that so we're still gonna do it okay so welcome back to episode 10 of but better it so for those of you who don't live in Texas the honey butter chicken biscuit is one of the most coveted sandwiches in Texas fast food history it is something that people here would consider unavoidable it's a um breakfast only item for some reason but water burger Whataburger reached out I will say really quickly that they have been very good sports so regardless of how this goes water burger if you're watching I appreciate you being so nice I think there's anything else that we really need to say about this other than let's make this shall we its water burger yeah it's actually what a burger everyone calls it water burger but I don't understand where they're getting the extra are can I get for honey butter chicken biscuits there's nobody okay I just maybe the honey this is gonna be better one I can't tell if I genuinely can't tell if we're supposed to wait your water burger you're already losing points right now bro this is supposed to be fast food good hurry up the transaction was faster that's good it's time for what a burger this is a coveted comfy Texas thing so I'll try to be gentle you have to be as unbiased as possible it's hard for me to be I got a lot of sandwiches come on now expecting it to look a little better I mean not saying that it looks it looks kind of it looks kind of sad I'm scared to say this cuz I know the Texans are gonna get mad at me but like okay maybe the taste is better this is still hot okay we're like two minutes away from it so don't want to hear anything okay I mean the chickens not bad it's crispy barely any honey butter on this look at this falling apart the actual taste is good I mean like it's good but like this is overripe I'm sorry I've never had this before either let me finish with this four people get to man me it's it's not like oh god this is so gross it's just like no I just maybe it was too hyped up for me maybe I expected more than what I got now it's our turn okay so before you do anything we need to first marinate our chicken so to make the marinade you're gonna combine two cups are 475 millilitres of buttermilk half a tablespoon or 12 grams of gochujang optional 2 teaspoons are 6 grams of white pepper 1 tablespoon or 8 grams of garlic powder 1 tablespoon or 8 grams of onion powder 1 and 1/2 teaspoons or seven grams of kosher salt and 1 tablespoon or 8 grams of smoked paprika give that some whiskey business until thoroughly combined and depending on how many pieces of chicken you want I'd recommend starting with 2 to 4 chicken breasts cutting those in half like so now look the thickness is pretty different between these two pieces so take the thicker end cover it in some plastic wrap and beat it down until it is the same thickness as the other piece no thinner though then just dump those bad boys for the nice little buttermilk bath cover them with plastic wrap and let them marinate for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator now when you're ready to actually make this sandwich we need to first start with our buttermilk biscuit this is an important piece make no mistake so in a food processor you're gonna combine 2 and 3/4 of a cup or 375 grams of all-purpose flour two tablespoons are 26 grams of baking powder and 2/3 of a teaspoon or three grams of fine sea salt what's that a few times in your food processor until thoroughly combined a whiskey business today before you add your butter make sure to measure it and get the exact 140 grams without even trying it just flex on that then cube it up into half inch cubes doesn't have to be perfect now make sure this butter is really cold if it's not place it in the freezer for about 5 minutes and then add 2/3 of a cup or 140 grams of cubed very cold butter and pulse it on your food processor about 12 to 14 times or until you get little pea-sized balls in there pour that into a bowl and then using a fork you're then going to mix it in 1 cup or 240 milliliters of butter milk slowly streaming in mixing streaming in and mixing till you've added all of your buttermilk and you get a solid mass if it feels a bit dry just add an extra tablespoon or so of buttermilk dump it out onto a work surface gently knead it until it comes together roll it out into a rough rectangle fold it like a letter roll it out again lengthwise fold it like a letter again and let it rest in the fridge for about 5 minutes now what's your toast done taking a nap pull it out lightly flour your work surface and roll it out until you get a rectangle that's about three quarters of an inch thick then using a three to four inch biscuit cutter cut out many biscuits as you can place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper now look I know you got a lot of excess dough here no problem just bring it back together hold it roughly into a single shape roll it back out into a 3/4 of an inch thick rectangle and punch out as many biscuits as you can brush the tops with some extra buttermilk go light here you don't need to go crazy then place them in an oven set to 425 degrees Fahrenheit for about 15 to 17 minutes or until the tops are golden beautiful Brown like this I mean look at that that is a perfect buttermilk biscuit slap some butter on there slap some honey on there but more specifically slap something on there to flex or warble good okay so we have our elements ready it's time to fry our chicky first to fill a heavy-bottomed pot with enough fry oil just to go up about two-and-a-half to three inches high make sure you're not filling it anywhere higher than three-quarters of the way up otherwise you're risking a fire hazard and I don't want to get any messages about that sort of thing send it over the stove go ahead and bring that up to about 350 degrees Fahrenheit now while that's coming up make your dredge by combining two cups are 300 grams of all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon or 10 grams of kosher salt 1 teaspoon or 3 grams of smoked paprika 1 tablespoon or 8 grams of garlic powder 1 tablespoon or 8 grams of serrano powder which is optional but if you want to be fancy then you can do that 1 and a half teaspoons or 1 gram of fresh ground black pepper give it some whiskey business until thoroughly combined in will ready to fly some chickie to bread your chicken pull a piece of chicken out of your buttermilk marinade drop it in your flour mixture toss and press aggressively to get every single crevice totally hydrated with flour until it's totally dry shake off the excess and place it to the side now look another thing that you can do is you can drizzle just a little bit of your buttermilk marinade into the flour toss it around so you get little tiny little pieces of clumped up flour in there and then toss your chicken and press in there and you'll get this little flaky nubs all around the pieces of chicken anyway rinse to repeat with all of your chicken make sure that there's no wet spots on any chicken and once all of your chicken is breaded you're then going to drop your chicken into your 350 degree Fahrenheit oil in batches I would say like 2 to 3 pieces per batch for 5 to 7 minutes or until beautifully golden brown and quit be like this as each piece finishes make sure to place it on a wire rack set over a baking sheet just to drain that excess oil off repeat with the rest but now we need to talk about the coveted honey button it's a reference to the song where he says honey butter I don't know if you in a small pot combine 1/2 for 120 milliliters of wildflower honey with an optional 1 tablespoon or 14 mils of avocado honey we sit on your stovetop medium heat and as soon as it becomes nice and hot turn the heat off and in 6 leaves of fresh sage then begin whisking and whisk in 3 and a half tablespoons our 50 grams of a really good salted butter specifically salted and just keep whisking whisking whisking do not stop until it's beautifully emulsified into a nice smooth and thickie honey butter if it separates then well you did it wrong don't don't let that happen please open up a nice hot biscuit putting this together is very simple you got your bottom half of your biscuit gently but lovingly place a piece of chicken onto the biscuit drizzle generously with your honey butter goes generous as you want there's really no such thing as too much of this stuff and well that's it crown your king and you've got a honey butter chicken biscuit now for the moment you've been waiting for the taste test first off the flecks on this sandwich is his timing is so impeccable okay so my mouth is watering look at this it's looking mad in a while so first a sound bite I'm at a loss for words this is do I even need to say anything do I really the chicken is perfectly seasoned it's I'm sweating this is soaking I'm I'm like drenched the honey butter is like you really taste the sage and the honey the components of the butter the biscuit I don't see nothing fall our part of your bro ain't doing it definitely help gather broker you right into the corner I'm gonna shift them around shifting them around Oh them around it's just like one of those lipgloss to top it now let me hold that no please nope I'm gonna feed it to you man damn put your hands down hands all the way down at your sides I feel as though I didn't get enough honey water to cleanse the palate I'm squishing it for you to just take the bite so one or two two one I forgot I didn't get any honey I don't know a little flap to is really good and two is better one I feel like I didn't get anything other than just like oh no I just like didn't have any flavor didn't really taste like anything we blindfolded this time the winner is me again always that's how it goes water burgers thank you for being a good sport I appreciate it I know you

Almost enigmatic in its delicious qualities. If you know, you know. If not... well then learn how to make these bad boys at home,...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, the world of French pastry almost seems like a coveted secret the beauty the flavor the texture well not anymore [Music] okay so we're making candlelight or kennel a gun le ah look I don't know I'm not you guys know that I'm not the best at pronunciation you know I'm not gonna be talking with my normal accent and just randomly throw in a punchy accent from another country or language or whatever it's just weird you know like oh hey guys come on over let's make a little bit of a spaghetti you know it's like not necessary you don't need to go that hard so we've made croissants which is arguably the most famous of French pastries which brings me to the humble cannoli this is if you've never had this before this is in my opinion one of the greatest sweet French pastries of all time there's really nothing else on the planet like it so whether you've had it or not most people never think to make it but it's actually very very easy to make so without that said let's do this shall we okay so to make can delay your going to need kennel a molds now the superior choice is always gonna be French copper it means even deep dark browning but they're extremely expensive now with a more affordable second option you can use this silicone one you can see me doing this with it it's a massively more affordable option but just be aware that your caramelization may not be as Extreme as mine now if you are using copper molds I would recommend seasoning them before their first use according to the instructions based off of where you bought them but the protocol is pretty much the same as a carbon steel pan making the batter is actually really easy you start with a small saucepan violently toss in 50 grams of nice butter you don't have to do it violently it's fine followed by 485 grams of whole milk in the beans from one vanilla bean pot and go ahead and toss the vanilla bean pod in there too why not listen over the stove over medium heat and as soon as it comes to a simmer take it off the heat and let it steep for about ten minutes in a separate bowl add a hundred grams of all-purpose flour 200 grams of granulated sugar in a small pinch of fine sea salt give it some whiskey business until thoroughly incorporated now once your hot milk mixture has been steeped you're gonna get another separate bowl and you're gonna whisk together two eggs plus two egg yolks make sure not to incorporate any air okay we're not making meringue here now while whisking your egg mixture splashing a little bit of your milk mixture let that incorporate splashing a little more let it incorporate what you're doing is you're tempering your eggs you don't want to like throw in all the hot liquid and then make scrambled eggs you just do it a little bit at a time until it comes up to temperature then go ahead and add all the milk mixture we sit together until thoroughly combined and finally add 50 grams of a good rum again making sure not to incorporate too much air remove your vanilla bean but wait don't throw it away then pour your liquid into your dry ingredients whisking together just until combined do not over mix then just pass your batter through a fine-mesh sieve now if your mixture is still really hot I've recommend ice bath and it just until it's cold extra vanilla beans back to the mixture then just cover that bad boy and place in the refrigerator for at least 48 hours some say 24 hours is enough I disagree 48 seems to be the sweet spot this is crucial for properly flavored and textured candle and just like that the next day open your fridge and boom you got candlelight just kidding hold your dang horses so on bake day you're gonna pre-heat your oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit for at least one hour no well that's preheating we need to coat our molds so here I've got a hundred percent organic beeswax this is a traditional way to do it in a heatproof container you're gonna combine 50 grams of beeswax and 100 grams of butter ideally clarified but you can get away with it not being clarified and just place that heat proof container in a simmering pot of water obviously making sure the water doesn't get in the pot till it's completely and totally melted now to coat the molds I'm gonna pour the melted mixture into a mold almost all the way to the top pour it all back out quickly and then immediately turn them upside down on a wire rack and let them drip now if you let it sit inside too much you will over coat the molds I've had a couple of these get over coated and it's gonna feel like you chewed on a piece of chapstick when you're done eating me so then repeat with the rest and before filling and baking place them in the freezer for about 15 minutes okay so once all that's done you're ready to fill these bad boys up this part is more important than you realize a lot of guys will say fill it one centimeter from the top I found that you need to be very precise here no more than 60 to 70 grams of batter per mold if you overfill you're gonna end up with white butts and well let me just say that they look like this and they're not very pretty and it ruins the whole point so don't do that now once all of your now once all of your mug like that now once all of your molds are filled place them in your oven and bake them at 500 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes then lower the temp to 375 and bake for an additional 45 to 50 minutes or until beautifully burnished Brown all around every piece every side you can always check by tipping one out and if it has a white butt then pop it back and leave it in for an extra 5 minutes or until looks bu they just let those cool in Iraq until completely cool and there's only one thing left to do enjoy your labor of love it's time for the cannon despite the fact that he had trouble browning some of these okay I'm gonna fix it we fixed it this is my future we fixed it and that's very good because originally right looks good but then you see this and then you're like bro no this is actually a pretty good candle I because it's it completely intact very good so anyways I'm gonna eat it so whenever you make candlelight you should have like a nice open airy almost like custardy spunky interior which is exactly what should be it's got a little crunch to it right so we're gonna eat it oh yes the flavors so anyway so the the texture super chewy crunchy caramelized on the outside but the inside is like a Louie dreamland and you're just flying with the clouds and the clouds are made of sweet vanilla bean rum custard but it's candle evil most pieces are not gonna have access to finding a really good pastry like this you can make it at home it's tedious but I can easily tell you right now it's worth it but do you want to know what else is worth it be roll [Music] alright guys and that is it so we made candle a I think we did a pretty damn good job you know the first try was the Browning was a little bit difficult but we fixed it we came we came full circle it all came together this is obviously not the easiest pastry it's something you just slap it in a pan and go you know it takes patience you gotta wait for the batter to rest and you got to have the right tins and gonna make sure you have just the right amount of wax and it's just the right temperature and blood I don't remember blah but I cannot tell you how worthwhile it is to make this for yourself I mean if you don't have a bakery that makes Kenna Lane near you like good

Making great homemade bbq ribs shouldn't be limited to the smokehouse homies....",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, so from a traditionalist perspective this is not exactly the recipe that I would want to do because I prefer to smoke them but if you think you can't have great ribs without a smoker but I think we need to redress that I think copies just for drinking but also it can be used in many other ways that's why today's video sponsored by trade coffee you see trade coffee has a massive selection of some of the greatest roasted to order coffee in the world but look I'm a little bit I'm a little bit I'm a little bit indecisive [Music] that's why I love their coffee matchmaker function that will set you up with the perfect coffee for you and if you click the link below you'll get 30% off your first bag of coffee with tree coffee so for me in trade coffee to you is you okay so we are making rig whether you have a smoker or not but hopefully you have a grill but also you can do without a grill the point is I want people to be able to make delicious barbecue smoky ish glazed lacquered kissed loved snuggle ribs that melt in your mouth I mean let me tell you something if that rib bone doesn't slide on out real nice and smooth then you need help so with all that said let's make this shall we okay so to get things started we need to make our rib rub sort of with two tablespoons or 20 grams of kosher salt one tablespoon or 12 grams of brown sugar and 1 tablespoon or 9 grams of smoked paprika 1 tablespoon or 10 grams of garlic powder and obviously since we're talking about coffee two tablespoons or 10 grams of fresh finely ground coffee make sure this is the good stuff I'm not talking any cheapo stuff all right you know where to go for this give it some whiskey business until everything is thoroughly combined and would you look at that it's a gosh-darn rib rib now before you get to rub in your ribs you don't want to make sure that you remove this layer of tissue that runs along the top of the ribs now lots of places will remove this but you can always tell it's there there's like a shiny sort of hard film you can't really cut through it that stuff is not gonna get cooked off so just kind of work your finger under there look no no inappropriate jokes all right and it should peel off relatively easily once that peels off you got this nice little revealed rib piece and the whole thing is edible it's great - the bone obviously this is enough rub for two to four racks of seat Lois or baby back ribs depending on their size season each rack of ribs very generously with your ear rub and well obviously you're gonna rub it all over because it's a rib rub and you should be rubbing your ribs now once all your racks are rubbed got them saying this a lot place each individual rack in an envelope of foil give a little splash of vinegar of your choice actually use this yuzu rice vinegar it's not Bradley only using it he's a homey so I had to do it then just take the foil and fold it up and around the ribs sort of creating a nice crease at the top you want to do this in a way so it can't leak out the bottom that's very very important you're closing the envelope at the very top on all edges there are no edges that lead to leakage and need wear so you lit nice and tight and place it in of incepted for two and a half to three hours or until extreme tender my tender I mean you should be able to pull the rib bones out real easy well that's cooking let's make our Barbie sauce so in a pot you're gonna combine 1 cup or 285 grams of ketchup 1/4 cup of 50 grams of brown sugar 2 teaspoons or seven grams of kosher salt 2 tablespoons or 24 grams of white vinegar look there's a lot of ingredients obviously we're almost there 2 tablespoons are 24 grams of yuzu rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar have a couple hundred 20 grams of water 1 tablespoon or 10 grams of garlic powder and 1 tablespoon or 10 grams of smoked it of smoking of smoked paprika yeah you can also add a little bit your coffee season and a splash your dashi if you're feeling extra fancy then just mix it together place it over medium heat and simmer that sauce for 30 minutes or until nice and reduced and thickie like this now hold up a minute so this is a tasty barbecue sauce it's great sure cool you can use it for lots of stuff it's gonna work just fine as it is but why not take it just an extra step further by also cold smoking it if you have any sort of a cold smoking gun you should absolutely use it at this point I'd recommend filling the bowl up with smoke let it sit covered for 10 minutes and repeat that two to three times or until it's nice and smoky tasting it's not required but tasty okay so once your ribs are done take him out of the oven open them up bathe in their glorious beauty now look at this point you could do a couple different things I personally like to grill mine and glaze them but before you do that you really want to let this cool down a little bit cuz they will fall apart on the grill I actually like to chill mine overnight but hey if you don't want to go that far then you can absolutely just glaze them embroil them whatever method you choose just make sure that your charring them while also constantly glazing them until they get a nice thick lacquer so you can see me grilling him here and brushing them then that's pretty much it once they're nice and lacquered hot and they got a little bit of crispy going on then I would say that the little piggy went home and by home I mean you got a nice glazed rack of ribs and it's time to eat okay so it's whippy you see that's how you know they're tenders when this when this happens ah yes queasy we got st. Louis we also got baby back yeah st. louis-style ribs I mean look have a look have a little bite all right you know what I personally think this recipe is better for st. Louis ribs instead of the baby back ribs buzz baby back ribs are kind of bad Nate and therefore the glaze doesn't penetrate as much so unless you're smoking them st. Louis ribs glaze really well with this recipe a solid 10 out of 10 if you don't have a smoker but you want to have solid ribs this is the only way that you should be going but you want to know what else is the only way you should be going b-roll alright guys and that is it so we made ribs without a smoker and you know what they turned out really really really I would just say the biggest thing that makes these ribs so great is making sure they get a nice thick lacquer and making sure that you add plenty of salt salty salty salty and also letting them rest overnight with that seasoning lady really quick thank you to trade coffee so much for sponsoring this video guys don't forget to take advantage of the 30% off deal the link is in the description be sure to click that you love these guys you know I drink their coffee all the time and and they genuinely have all of my favorite coffees and I really mean that it's not just like cuz it's a sponsorship but that's like a real it's like a real thing a lot of a lot of really cool things that we started doing that is involving some major players in the game and I can't quite tell you I know I've said this the last few times but man y'all better get ready because as soon as this whole like you got stayin you're got bang home be like chillin in here with your lasso soon as that's gone whoa um if there's anything that you guys want to see in the meantime I'm really curious what everybody's thinking about you know life and food and what and what they see with their life what do you want to see during this time before social distancing is lifted what do you want to see food wise cook boys hit me in the comments DM me on Instagram you know that all that's in the link in the description that's a classic you to be thing to say but anyway if you enjoy this video or learn something leave a like subscribe and I will see you next time [Music]

It's not just ingredients that make a great curry but the process that goes into it that...,2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, the wonderful world of curry it's a confusing one I get it a lot of people don't really get it alright that you put a little bit in the pan you put some curry powder and you're done no just no let's explore this one together before we actually talk about that let's discuss the Krispy Kreme by better a lot of people think that my donut was not as good as Krispy Kremes because I made the donut hole you noticed fine but you can have it I shouldn't let that happen that was very stupid the point is I want you to understand that there's gonna be a rematch and I will make sure that it is but until then we're gonna just gonna have to wait on though okay so we're making chicken tikka masala these but this is a more spiced version there's definitely still cream there's definitely still butter and there's definitely still Tomatoes but it's the spicing anyway with that said let's make this shall we okay so we need to start off by spicing things up with literal spices first get a small pan and add one tablespoon or four grams of coriander seeds along with half a teaspoon or one gram of cumin seeds keep that bad boy over medium heat tossing often until fragrant and toasted about two minutes remove from the pan and let them spicy boys cool for a little bit in a blender add your spices slap around in there a little bit until as fine as possible then add seven cloves of garlic a two inch knob of fresh peeled ginger 1 tablespoon or seven grams of garam masala 1 TSP or 3 grams of turmeric powder and 2 red Fresno or Birds Eye Chili's stems removed obviously lastly a quarter cup of water then go ahead and begin blending this you'll need to use your trusty blender plunger if you have one to help get it smooth once it's mostly smooth go and drizzle in two tablespoons or 30 milliliters of canola oil while blending now keep on blending until nicely incorporated and smooth remember this ain't no chunky salsa it's your curry paste as smooth as possible ok so before we get started on the actual curry gravy let's give this chickie a little yogurt bath but look this is a crucial step please don't skip this or I'll be family angry with you so first cut 2 pounds of boneless skinless chicken thighs tongue twister into bite-size pieces in a bowl mix together 1 cup or 250 5 grams of whole milk yogurt 2 tablespoons or 30 grams of your tikka masala paste and two teaspoons or six grams of kosher salt then toss your chicken in the yogurt mixture cover with plastic wrap and let marinate for 20 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator now obviously we're gonna serve this curry with rice but please do me a favor I really gonna note this if you don't wash your rice its time no more procrastinating please I am begging you please rinse and drain it at least two to three times before cooking I know a lot of people know this but look I cooked my bath body with a one to one ratio of water to rice and some cardamom pubs in a pressure cooker at high pressure for 6 minutes and then a natural release for 8 minutes or some mad good Baz Maggi bros to make the funnel curry blend one 28-ounce can of whole peeled tomatoes past that period mixture through a sieve and place up to the satoru nee now heat a large saute pan or a medium sized pot over medium-high heat with enough oil to coat the bottom syria chicken on both sides till nicely brown about 3 to 4 minutes each side and placed it aside as well now once all your chicken is seared and you have a nice little fond in the bottom of your pan reduce the heat to medium and add 4 tablespoons or 56 grams of unsalted butter once it's hot and bubbly add one large diced sweet onion let that cook until the onion begins to turn translucent then add all of your remaining tikka masala paste plus 1 tablespoon or seven grams of paprika and 1 teaspoon or two grams of Kashmiri chilli powder cook that stirring often until the pace begins to stick to the bottom of the pan then add your pureed tomatoes stir nicely and bring that up to a simmer over medium heat let that simmer for about 10 minutes stirring occasionally until it becomes thickened and then finally you can add one and a quarter cup or 300 millilitres of heavy cream mix until thoroughly combined add your chicken back to the pan as well coated in the sauce and bring that back up to a simmer simmer an additional 10 to 15 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thickened velvety smooth and gorgeous season that to taste with salt and serve alongside some lovely steamed basmati rice garnish with fresh cilantro and now we must first pass this dish with a trial by fire and by fire I mean in my mouth and by my mouth I mean I'm gonna eat it right so proper spoon tikka masala let's go brav that's how you know it's real silver right [Music] Wow I mean come on you gotta be joking me with this Fisher's out of all the parties you could be making this is easily going to be one of the best that you ever make in your life Wow for one my rice is cooked perfectly all right I may be white but I can cook directly okay you get the point this is ridiculous how perfect this tastes a little spicy a little bit of sweetness from the tomato all the flavors meld together exactly what you want and more of its creamy perfectly the rice the texture ah that's a ten so okay okay but do you wanna know what else is so good [Music] alright guys and that is it so we made chicken tikka masala I think it turned out honestly I don't to use the word perfect but pretty darn close to that he heard look I may be white okay but I do try to stay as close culturally as I can to the right way of doing it in terms of tradition I'm using a couple different things to do this it's the prior knowledge that I've learned from other chefs on the basics of curry and then also just in general some flavors that I personally feel balancing wise makes sense in this recipe that's my personal tape the haters are gonna come in you are welcome and entitled to that opinion but I will say that it is delicious so that's the word bro there are some crazy things in the works right now god I wish I could talk about all of it you're gonna see in the coming weeks and months and years but man the amount of opportunities that you guys have afforded me is is it's just absolutely shocking honestly to say the least so I just want to say I used to say this all the time and I haven't said it as much recently but I'm always thinking about it I'm just so grateful for you guys very very thankful for all these opportunities I want to make sure that you guys know that I'm constantly thinking about this honestly I don't say this much

I will say, this is the nicest I've ever been to any of the participants in but better. But will that be enough for them to win? Welcome back to But Better,...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.386764, when we think of mass manufactured donuts there is one company that comes to mind and they want to go up against me yeah sure they may not have asked to we're gonna do it anyway they call it the original donut but first off why do they even call it a donut dough and nut hmm I don't like that the point is we have a donut contender and there's only one thing left to do about that we're gonna be the end of me saying Krispy this is gonna be the last because this actually is we last night Kate and I were talking about how we're starting our diets and that was two nights ago what do you how do you think we'll do yeah okay I appreciate it I needed a blessing we have the Krispy Kreme blessing yeah we got the Box I'm really liking the smell that artificial flavoring I got an assortment of donuts but we're not talking about all the donuts we're just talking about this the classic glazed spit listen I hate to say but they're good like they're pretty good they're really soft and these are the whole way oh he really revved it up at the end there how he was like he was like and I was like all wait and using their perfect looking and they're nice and glazed bla bla bla bla bla bla bla but I wanted on these there's a texture thing at the end I don't like almost like a sly meanness from me like they have some sort of like shortening plus some sort of binder I don't know what it is yeah sorry but we can do certif by keeping your measurements little checker oniy then combine one and a quarter cup or 295 millilitres of whole milk and a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of water I'm that up until it's about 95 to 98 degrees Fahrenheit to that you're gonna mix in two and a half teaspoons or seven grams of instant yeast then let that sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes okay so here I have four and a half cups or 660 grams of all-purpose flour but wait I'm only adding half of that to our stand mixer bowl here sounded weirdly southern then you're gonna add 1/3 a cup plus one tablespoon or 91 grams of granulated sugar what enough teaspoons or 5 grams of fine sea salt give that some whiskey business until thoroughly combined hop on your spiral dough hook thingy Ling and begin mixing on medium speed well that's mixing you're gonna add your yeasty milky mixture that sounds nice doesn't it along with 2 whole eggs let that mix for a little bit and as soon as it begins to come together you're gonna add half a cup or 78 grams of shortening that's room temperature yes I know oh my gosh josh is using shortening it's the end of the world look we're making Krispy Kreme donuts okay not Josh's Donuts alright we're trying to make this as poopy as possible yucky poopy very nice thank you anyway you're gonna continue to mix that on medium speed scraping on the sides the bowl as necessary for about 2 to 3 minutes once everything's nice to incorporate it in smooth looking but then going to add the rest of your flour and then continue to mix until combined and nice and smooth another 2 minutes or so now look if it's too sticky boy hours you can always add a couple extra tablespoons of flour but it does need to be a little bit wet your heard like I said this dough's a little bit sticky so what's your done mixing lightly flour or work surface dump out your dough slap it around a little bit if it's not behaving gently shape it into a ball plop it into a greased bowl and then cover with grease plastic wrap and let that rise at room temperature for about an hour or until doubled and thick like this before we get started let's make our glaze to have it ready sort of by measuring two and a half cups our 330 grams of powdered sugar then mix in four tablespoons of whole milk 1 tablespoon at a time we set together and once it begins to turn nice and smooth you then going to add two tablespoons or 28 grams of corn syrup now you might be wondering why and the reason is because that's what gives it that classic crackle whenever you bite into it and optionally you can add a little splash of that good old vs vanilla extract stir all that together until completely smooth and looking reminiscent of something else right so donuts we punch our dough down aggressively but this time we're gonna gently slap it down no Pat's give it some love but degassed that be generously floor a work surface dump out your dough divide it into two equal pieces do your best to make it equal all right bits it's not rocket science take one of those halves roll it out until it's about 1/2 of an inch thick then using a four inch round biscuit cutter you're just gonna cut out as many rounds as you can you'll get around 12 total from all the dough here and obviously using a smaller biscuit cutter at least half the size cutting out your holes for the doughnuts I made my holes a little too big I was trying to give them the classic shape and well I ended up with big donut hole energy but that's that's fine okay it's fine I'm not angry about it all right I'm not once you have all of your donut shapes don't know why I said it like that I'm gonna fill a large deep cast-iron pan with about two inches worth of oil but don't fill it beyond about halfway wanna make sure your Donuts have room to float heat your oiled about 375 degrees Fahrenheit carefully drop in your donuts lay them away from you unless you want to splash hot oil all over yourself please don't do that okay firm for about 90 to 100 seconds then flip them over another 90 100 seconds or until nice and poonam beautifully browned and transfer them to a wire rack lined baking sheet then just repeat with the rest of your donuts once all the donuts are fried you're then going to dip them in the icing generously coating them place them back onto your wire rack to drip drain make sure the glaze coats the whole donut repeat with the rest now once all of your donuts are glazed this is the most important step let them sit and let the glaze harden once the glaze is completely dried you then may eat and enjoy which we shall do now - no we have so visually they look a little bit different than the typical Krispy Kreme cuz they're made by human with two hands not a machine Krispy Kreme eaters they are made by a machine alright let us begin so it's good I know that it's good I knew it would be good but I need a comparison so let's take a bite this is just straight sugar so when you're eating this you know you don't want to like you're like oh yeah but have a donor than just lately straight sugar in the mouth nobody wants that my are also cooked a little bit darker so you get some of that toasted deep flavor so all things considered overall flavor texture the ingredients use just the final product as a whole as always we won and I feel I feel like we won so I need a secondary opinion crime there you go okay and this says Krispy Kreme here's the differences this one is thicker than this one and also thicker like there's more bite to it would she chewy yes and then this one this is like a gonna scale the Krispy Kreme it kind of tastes like fast food and like the aftertaste so we won what better episode nine heard it here she said it she said Josh you won very good job very proud of you think guys round applause thank you so much all right thank you thank you bye-bye bye-bye we win again thank you so much oh my gosh Wow I really really appreciate it okay love you bye but you want to know what else appreciates the quiz between bureau alright guys and that is it so we made Krispy Kreme Doughnuts I think we got pretty darn close as a matter of fact they're different enough that I think they kind of stand alone on their own I don't know that I would say that they're necessarily better or not I felt like for my personal taste mine were better but also the same token it's not to say that the Krispy Kreme ones were dramatically lesser either but they did have that like a skate with saying the fast-food flavor they've got that like old taste to them it's like this oil that's been frying for too long or something I don't know what it is but like it's just got this lesser flavor it's got a bitterness to it it's got a just a flat sweetness to it with no depth you got to have dirt and my stomach hurts because all I have eaten today is done but if you enjoyed this video or you

You know how I am. Not to mention our special guest Roy Choi from The Chef Show on Netflix...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.387765, so nowadays there's a lot more people making their own breads and buns for their burgers and sandwiches but how are you not gonna dress up your wiener bro come on it's time for that to change okay so we're making hot dog buns and we're gonna talk about how to make a beautiful hot dog I don't know why the cadence of that sounded so weird hot dogs are an American favorite right everybody knows about them but they're not just for America there's plenty of sausage sandwiches everywhere all sorts of different kinds and I think that it's very reminiscent of all that now I'm sure that there's some background there but although this is a video about the buns we have a very special guest which we're going to be talking to Roy Choi's gonna be in the building via zoom so I'm very excited about that we're gonna we're gonna talk about hot dogs and all sorts of good things together but first let's make this shall we mask off your mustard isn't $20 waste their time that's with most flippin bread recipes to mine half a cup per 120 milliliters of warm water with half a cup of 120 milliliters of warm milk around 95 degrees Fahrenheit mix in two and a half teaspoons or nine grams of active dry yeast ignore the measurements that you see on my Pyrex all right there's a reason that it's changed and let that sit at room temperature for about eight minutes in the bowl of your stand mixer come on three two half cups are 525 grams of bread flour one tablespoon or 15 grams of granulated sugar one and a half teaspoons or seven grams of fine sea salt give that some whiskey business slap it around till if it's thoroughly combined then set it up on your stand mixer with your spiral thingy turn that on to low-speed pouring your yeasty boy mixture along with one whole egg and one egg yolk let that mix together and once everything is really combined continue to mix until your dough starts to become smooth once you reach that stage you're then gonna add one tablespoon at a time two and a half tablespoons or 35 grams of softened unsalted butter let that mix until all of it is nice and thoroughly mixed yeah that does that does not roll off the tongue and you've got a nice plump thick e dough gently ship that into a ball three Super Bowl plop it in your bowl and cover that with grease plastic wrap let that rise at room temperature for about an hour or until it looks like a big boy like this I doubled yeah make sure you give it some love a nice little pad maybe a little kiss then beat it down what you forgot to give you your money have in it if the dough owed you money the UH it's a stupid dump your dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and then divide the dough into ten to twelve evenly sized pieces depending on how big you want your buns to be then once you've got your pieces carefully shape each piece into a ball you know using my typical method where you keep your fingers in contact with the board while rolling around in circles and it should form a taut skin like this now once you've got all your balls put together cover your ball with a damp towel and let them rest for about ten minutes now once your have rested we're then gonna carefully roll them into cylinders that are about five to six inches long Thank You Josh very cool place each cylinder onto a parchment-lined baking sheet separated a little less than half an inch apart that's okay we want them to touch they're gonna rise into each other on purpose now they should all fit together on one baking sheet once they're all lined up like this cover them with another baking sheet or grease plastic wrap and let them proof at room temperature for about 45 minutes once they proof they should look a little more plump we're silently with egg wash consisting of one beaten egg and a tablespoon of water and then place them in an oven set to 375 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 to 20 minutes or until beautifully golden brown like this no hold on they look great right but as soon as they come out of the oven you're gonna brush them generously with melted butter and now you have a beautifully glossy golden-brown hot dog bun anxiously awaiting a wiener but not just any wiener well it can be any wiener but more specifically I like to make my own sausages and I do have a guide for it it's on my youtube channel you guys know where to find it I'm talking fresh ground me fresh stuffed sausage I mean surely you don't need me to show you how to make a hot dog right I mean like you can just sear them or you can grill them this one's a bratwurst with a cognac mustard aioli a little bit of ketchup some diced pickles some finely diced sweet onion and some sliced pickled serrano I mean that's a fancy boy hotdog but you can do anything that you want and help drive that point forward I'd like to welcome our guest for today Roy thank you so much for coming on my man finally found a way to get together and the way that we met was with hot dogs so I was gonna ask you how you feel if I were to use sausages bratwurst specifically that I handmade hand-ground stuffed myself I could poach them right here or we can roll with yours how are you feeling about that I like the idea that it's that it's imperfect intentionally and I don't want to take it out of La so the poaching water they're not necessarily the most expensive or fancy ingredients but the alchemy of them all together in that moment I've got a cut bacon I'm gonna I'm gonna wrap them and wrap them now is it would that be the right place to start should I be doing something else right now probably the first place to start wrapping them is starting to cook them in the pan and having your music puffs ready for the onions and the peppers and all that stuff in the buns and everything else cooked very much like street food in in Austin so you know street food has many forms it has the truck-trailer the hotdog goes down and one more look it's like a bussers Parker but must discard at a restaurant or they'll either use that or a shopping cart with a she can really everything is cooked right there yeah so I got my pan I got my dogs wraps I got all my all my knees sliced and everything so dogs in the pan next right with the dogs [Music] ultimately if you on the street you do everything together in state so they wouldn't have an offset spatula no this is an offset spatula I can't stop myself it's looking good man it's starting to caramelize we've got a lot of fat rendered out God smells don't well like where this is headed I'm gonna add in the peppers onions jalapenos going in this smells dope I've got all my mise my hotdogs are done my onions are done toast buns and I'm good buns are going in it's assembly time right so I've got my my first set of buns already dog is on your sauces now look at fun is nice and spacious boop boop okay cool so I've got ketchup mayo mustard what I want to call it there let's take a bite let me see how it tastes okay here we go Wow sometimes it just comes down to a couple peppers and onions and one thank you for bringing this to everybody here I think a lot of the time I tend to make recipes that I'm always focused on what can I get people to do that forces them to look at it from its most basic value but I also think it's important to remember like at the end of the day should be eating stuff that you're happy with you're proud of that represents something that's important to you so I really I really respect that so I appreciate you coming on man thank you for that thank you bye but do you want to know who else makes thicky dogs with their homies this b-roll makes less and less sense [Music] alright guys and that is its so we made hot dog buns thank you so much to Roy Choi for joining us via zoom was a ton of fun great chatting with you about hot dogs and how it all just kind of comes together in a beautiful hot dog so I've got a really fun surprise I'm moving into a new kitchen very very soon I'm just like ecstatic to show you guys I'll be able to reveal that pretty soon here you're gonna see one way or another but yeah that's that's uh that feels good for today's video I feel very happy about that there are a lot of really amazing things in the works right now in the background that I can't quite talk about right now and I know I always say that but I just want it I just want to let you guys know I'm very thankful very grateful for you guys for helping me bring all these opportunities for for both myself and for everybody else

It's all in the technique and as it turns out, that's pretty easy too! And with that, welcome to episode 8. of But Better. :)

Recipe: https://www.joshuaw...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.387765, so one of my friends told me that this is the king of Nuggets no I think that there's a new king in town he's about to have it his way [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hi guys and welcome back to episode 8 of but better the series where we take coveted cold fast foods and junk foods and recreate them at home using classic cooking techniques with the hopes of making it better okay so we're making McDonald's McNuggets it's happening the thing is happening I've already done chick-fil-a Nuggets that was super fun do I think that either of these guys are the king of Nuggets boom that McDonald's McNuggets seem to have some sort of a charm I don't get it we're gonna taste it and it's gonna be great okay so with all that said let's make this shall we it's a time for McDonald's I can't believe I'm doing this this is like a breach of my own morals thank you YouTube we got the back the golden arches have arrived to our home I didn't think that they would break the forefront but they pushed and I opened my palace doors we got the meat nuggies I haven't eaten these in a long time and I'm a little bit scared but we do this for science not really crispy but I haven't had this in so long and get it it really does taste familiar a barbecue sauce that's something good to you not bad but I think we're fitting to have it now before we make our thicky nuggies i'm gonna make a quick barbecue sauce now stay with me here you're gonna need 1 cup or 270 grams of ketchup 1/4 cup are 63 grams of dark brown sugar 1 tablespoon or 7 grams of smoked paprika 1 tablespoon of 10 grams of garlic powder why don't have teaspoons are four grams of kosher salt one tablespoon or 15 grams of Dijon mustard 2 tablespoons or 25 grams of Worcestershire sauce okay look I know there's a lot of ingredients ready stay calm stay calm we're almost there one enough tablespoons are 16 grams of cheek young vinegar or Chinese black vinegar three tablespoons are 35 grams of rye whiskey which is optional okay I know it's a lot of ingredients okay just please half a cup per one hundred twenty milliliters of water 3 tablespoons are 35 grams of white distilled vinegar and an optional splash of sheer dashi after that it's really simple just whisk it together bring it up to a simmer and let it simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes or until it's thick II sticky like this and you've got yourself a beautiful barbecue sauce that's ready for any chicken nugget which speaking of okay so if we're gonna make chicken ugh jeez you're gonna need chicken I broke down this whole chicken just for the Flex but really you're gonna need one and a half pounds of chicken breast and I bought a quarter of a pound of chicken skin all right everybody's like well it's flavor okay cut your chicken breasts into 1-inch cubes and rough chop the chicken skin now look I know this next process is a little scale we okay I'm grinding the meat through a meat grinder but it's just a kitchen and attachment it's like 40 bucks or something like that the link for mine is in the description but if you don't want to do it that way then you can absolutely do it in a food processor just make sure to get it as fine as possible now once all of your meat and skin has been ground place that in a bowl and toss together with two teaspoons or 14 grams of kosher salt 1 teaspoon or 7 grams of granulated sugar and half a teaspoon or 1 gram of MSG yes the right way to make McNuggets oh so that's together until thoroughly combined until it's nice and homogeneous like this then place it in the freezer for 10 minutes to firm up or waiting let's set up our fry station fill a heavy-bottomed pot up with enough oil to go up around 2 and a half to 3 inches high but not more than like 60% full according to my research there's a three part parting process first you're gonna make a very thin batter consisting of a quarter cup or 45 grams of cornstarch whisk together with one cup or 240 milliliters of water and that's it next to flour dredge consisting of three cups or 450 grams of all-purpose flour one heaping tablespoon or 22 grams of kosher salt half a teaspoon or two grams of MSG one teaspoon or three grams of fresh ground white pepper and 1 teaspoon or two grams of celery powder was that together until thoroughly combined lamblia was and pour the new shell 8x8 baking dish and last is some sort of weird tempura batter that consists of half a cup or 75 grams of cornstarch yeah Pat that out really good idea josh nice work 3/4 of a cup 103 grams of all-purpose flour one and a quarter teaspoon or four grams of baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon or 1 gram of baking soda but set together until thoroughly combined and one cup of 240 milliliters of chilled water add 2 whisked eggs to that whisk until everything's thoroughly combined and that's your tempura stuff now to make your Nuggets gonna take out your firmed ground chicken you're gonna form them into chicken nugget esque shapes we're a little bit thick but you know how I feel about that 27 sees baby if they're too sticky lightly wet your hands before shaping now in batches first drop them in your thin cornstarch mixture then toss with the flour mixture until thoroughly coated shaking off the excess flour unless dip them in your tempura batter now wait from the tempura batter you're gonna quickly drop them into oil that's been set to 375 degrees Fahrenheit optionally if you want some extra flakiness you can bring them to the surface using a spider and just let your battered hands drip all over the nuggies again that's optional and requires some skill you totally skip that if you want then just let those fry for 5 to 7 minutes in batches or until nice and golden brown remove them and place them on a wire rack to cool and repeat with the rest the next thing you know you got McNuggets at home with a barbecue sauce that will make you sob yourself to sleep these are mine I know and then this is the McDonald's one obviously mine are a little bigger because I like it extra thick too sticky now the McDonald's nugget we're back again it's weird right like it tastes good but I still hate it so I'm gonna go and just taste mine don't pretty quickly the first thing to know the flavors pretty close the msg definitely helped crunching this is much more delicate although there's not much left in this there finally all right so let's taste the sauce oh right so we got there this is my sauce my sausage real good mine is definitely more complex Chiqui nuggie plus the sauce I think all things considered we definitively won but not exactly just by a landslide McDonald nugget I think that they're decent they're not like as bad as I thought they were to be honest but they also are still pretty pretty depressing I guess for this one we'll have it my way do you want know what else will have its way be alright guys and that is it so Mick chicky nuggies in the bag I think we did a wonderful job you know improving something that really isn't already that good is obviously not that hard but this one particularly was challenging I don't know why it just was I felt like the product that we got was a better product but not necessarily in the way that I expected it was still better and the sauce helps a lot yeah this was this is a fun one as an upload and all the but better series I think I'm gonna be uploading one extra but better per month so I was doing - I think I'm gonna start doing three but anyway if you enjoyed this video or you'll

This recipe ideally skips all of the typical fuss and stress around baking a cake. A simplified cake base with a perfectly rich chocolate...,2022-12-03 21:59:44.387765, so a lot of people get scared when it comes to cake making there's a lot of ingredients there's a lot of steps it's daunting this recipe is not bad [Music] okay so we have finally made it after all of the cake jokes all of the talking about my butt making jokes about it showing my butt you know we know you know what I'm talking about so the whole point here is we want to make a chocolate cake but we really want to cut down on all those steps there's a lot of process to it there's already so many ingredients so how can we cut down to make it easier that's essentially what we did here now granted it's not like you just put everything in a pan and put it in the oven and you're done like you have to do some mixing but for the most part this is really easy I don't want to hear anybody be like Oh Josh there's so many greedy this is made with ingredients that I'm hoping that most people will have in their pantry already and with all that said let's make this shall we okay so first things first I'm the realest oh wait no that's a different video um so start off by preparing two 9-inch cake pans specifically spring forms in this case you know unlock them cut out a piece of parchment paper to fit the bottom greased the bottom stick the parchment paper down all up in layer grease the parchment paper grease the walls and you're ready to go so you're gonna start by sifting out two cups or 300 grams of all-purpose flour then you're gonna realize that your bowl is too small you're gonna switch out to a bigger bowl because yeah we think ahead here then you're gonna sit in 3/4 of a cup or 80 grams of cocoa powder followed by 2 teaspoons or 10 grams of baking powder 3/4 of a teaspoon or 3 grams of baking soda I don't have teaspoons or 7 grams of fine sea salt and 1 cup or 220 grams of granulated white sugar 3/4 of a cup of 150 grams of brown sugar give that some whiskey business until it's thoroughly combined there see I said whiskey business all right everybody got mad because I didn't say it last time very sorry now look this next part you can totally just put all together in a bowl and mix it and that'll be fine but I like to do it this way which is you'll take two egg yolks so whisking those together and then you're gonna slowly drizzle in half a cup 120 milliliters of a neutral tasting oil you're essentially making a mayo right and it's gonna get nice and emulsified you now when it starts to get a little too thick you're then going to add 1 tablespoon or 12 grams of vanilla extract then continue to keep drizzling in your oil until all of it is added once all of its been added you're then going to add two large eggs whisk all this together and then take that custardy mix and you're gonna pour directly into your dry mix fold that together and it's gonna get all dry and clumpy and crumbly like this don't worry calm down all right it's fine that's that's supposed to happen now separately you're gonna heat up one in 3/4 of a cup or 415 milliliters of whole milk that it up just until it begins to simmer do not boil it pull it off the heat and then whisk it directly in your crumbly boil mixture now keep whisking and whisking whisking until everything is nice and thoroughly incorporated in as smooth as it'll go sometimes it'll get a little clumpy that's totally fine but you wanted to be as smooth as possible then just evenly split that between two 9-inch cake pans that have been prepared as described previously and you're just gonna pop that into the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit or 175 degrees Celsius for 30 to 35 minutes or until it inserted the toothpick comes out clean then just pull those out let those cool inside the cake pan for 10 minutes unmold your cake pan in this case au springform pans which are much easier to use then just carefully invert and L will come on and then place it on a wire rack until completely cool don't try to frost these if they're warm okay you're gonna have a real bad time brother all right also I would recommend cooling them upside down so that they stay flat I I kind of regret letting them stand up because the those rounded tops are a bit hard to shape so let the cool upside down so let's talk frosting you're gonna mix together four cups or 500 grams of powdered sugar 1/2 a cup of 55 grams of cocoa powder and a generous pinch of sea salt give this some whiskey business until thoroughly combined make sure you get some of that powder sugar smoke in the air that way you breathe it in coughing over the place but hey it tastes good using a stand mixer electric beaters beat 1/2 a cup or 110 grams of softened unsalted butter till nice and creamy and then beat in your powdered sugar mixture it's gonna get a little dustier it's fine add it in batches until it's all thoroughly combined and then thin it out with whole milk now you're gonna need around a quarter cup to a half a cup of whole milk just you know depending on how that goes you want the consistency to look like this when it's all done it should be thick yet easily spreadable now it's time to frost your cakes yeah it's a lot of jokes there but we're not gonna make them please one of your cakes on a cake stand or a cutting board add about a cup of your frosting into the center spread it out evenly add your next cake on top of that smush it down make sure it's nice and glued there and then spread the rest of your frosting on the top and all over the sides to seal the edges it doesn't have to be perfect right to be honest with you I'm not the best frosting spreader I'll beep now once everything is nice and frost it looks good right but just take it a little bit higher by freshly grating some nice dark chocolate on top get those little shavings everywhere bada bing bada boom your cake is done I would recommend letting that set for at least a couple hours or overnight but you can also cut it now if you want and yes you can leave this at room temperature just put an overturn bowl on top of it set it to the side and leave it in a cool area and of course you can refrigerate it as well then all there's left to do is slice an ad brother okay it's a gig done we finally made it to making cake after all the cake shots you thought that I would be celebrating this right now by showing even more cake this is plenty this is supposed to be a simple cake you know simple but effective for something so easy this is like a solid chocolate cake fudge here it's a little more dense and desirable way you know almost like a brownie it's not as cakey I don't like my cakes super fluffy and cake I like something with more toothsome miss you know cavities after you eat this your blood Sugar's gonna be like Kate is suggesting that we eat this with milk and drink milk on the side you're just drinking milk all I have to say to you is lots of people are gonna slave over the process of making this you don't have to do that with this cake and it is just as good if not better than any other chocolate cake but do you want no one else is full of chocolaty thickness my ass I mean be rolled [Music] alright guys and that is it so this is a this so this is a short one today the whole point is this supposed to be simple so there's just not really enough stuff to do to make this a long video I don't think it needs to be long it should be short sweet and to the point I'm a big fan of chocolate cake if I'm gonna get a cake it's usually gonna be chocolate now is this the best cake of all time I don't know that I would say that but it is extremely satisfying and if you have if you want to make a cake for someone's birthday and it's last second you want to spend a bunch of hours doing it or you want to make a cake that doesn't take a bunch of slaving in the kitchen but creates a wonderful product then this is your answer but regardless of what you choose to do in your cake making life if you enjoyed this video or

It is a cultural symbol of food that resonates with the heart of any foodie. We're taking...,2022-12-03 21:59:44.387765, now you may be thinking Josh we don't need a whole video just for a sandwich whoa whoa whoa just a sandwich this is a cultural work of art but also yeah [Music] we've been to do the humble Cubano now with a lot of people have requested this obviously a lot of you guys know it from the movie chef where my favorite movies of all time there's a lot of specifics that make this sandwich special it's not just a sandwich there's a whole lot of stuff that goes into making it and it's really kind of supposed to have a specific outcome granted there are things that people play with and all the purists that are watching this are probably going to take a fad because they're like oh you did this wrong and I just don't care because to me this tasted very close to what is correct and it was very delicious and I sort of made it my way but with respect to the culture so with that said let's make this shall we first thing we need to talk about is our Moho pork you need a big thick three to four pound boneless pork shoulder except for the fact that I didn't look at the sign and it was misleading and actually was not boneless and I had to debone it myself yeah don't do that not to a blender you're gonna add two peeled shallots 2 heads worth of garlic cloves like 15 close the zest of two oranges in the zest of 3 limes 2 tablespoons of fresh oregano leaves 1/2 a bunch of fresh mint leaves 1 tablespoon or 5 grams of fresh ground cumin 2 whole serrano chiles 1 cup or 240 milliliters of olive oil we don't have tablespoons or 26 grams of kosher salt and lastly 1 cup or 240 milliliters each of lime juice and orange juice so 2 cups total put a little on your spinny cutty thing and blend it on high speed until completely smooth and nice looking like this now this is your mohawk marinade separate out one cup and place it in the fridge you can use that for lots of stuff and we're also gonna use it for the sandwich later now the rest of your Moho you're gonna pour over your pork into a plastic bag seal it nicely and let it marinate in the fridge overnight make sure that there's no leaks or you gonna have a bad time let's talk Cuban bread finding the good stuff can be rather hard so we're gonna make our own start off by mixing 1 and 1/4 cup or 295 milliliters of warm water around 100 degrees Fahrenheit with 1 tablespoon or 10 grams of active dry yeast give a little Mixy Mixy and let that sit for about 8 minutes while that's sitting you're gonna mix together three and a half cups or 500 grams of bread flour along with 1 tablespoon or 13 grams of granulated sugar and 2 teaspoons or 5 grams of fine sea salt whisk that together until thoroughly combined begin mixing on medium-low speed in a stand mixer add in your warm yeast mixture let that stir and knead until everything's thoroughly combined and continue to mix for about 3 to 5 minutes or until it begins to turn smooth then I two and a half tablespoons are 30 grams of solidified lard yes specifically largest do it don't be a widow baby and then mix on low speed for about a minute until combined and nice and smooth oil up a medium sized Bowl shape your dough into a ball and place it into your bowl cover it with grease plastic wrap and let that rise for 45 minutes to an hour or until doubled degassed your dough by backhanding it repeatedly just punch it down yet dump it out onto a lightly floured work surface and divide it into two even pieces cover your dough with a damp towel and let it rest for about 10 minutes just to relax little sleep easily now take one of your segments of dough and flatten it out so you get roughly a half inch thick rectangle and then starting from the bottom closest to you you're gonna tightly roll it up from the bottom all the way up to the top doing your best to close the seams on the bottom and on the sides and then carefully begin rolling it out while applying pressure outward to sort of taper the ends and one thing about tension is you can rub your fingers along the length of the dough while also keeping contact with your board help tighten it up a little bit please have finished log onto a parchment lined baking sheet repeat with the second log and place it in the same baking sheet at least four to five inches apart cover that baking sheet with another baking sheet and let that proof for about 30 minutes at room temperature to bake these lightly spray them with water and then using a razor blade and score shows seam along the entire length of the dough place it in an oven that's been preheated to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and underneath that you're gonna add a small pan of boiling water make sure to spray the inside of the oven just a little bit we're generating steam here close the oven and let that steam for 8 to 10 minutes reduce the heat to 375 remove your steaming pan and let it bake for another 20 to 22 minutes or until you pull out too thick plump lightly browned Cuban breads make sure to let this cool down completely before you use it I actually like to bake this stuff a day or two ahead of time it's okay if they're soft because you're toasting it anyway Wow first off big win my son that sounds really good put it down put it down and now it's Cubano okay so back to our marinating pork carefully remove your pork from the marinade place it into a 7-quart Dutch oven and then pour in all the marinade into the same pot with the pork cheek come up around halfway and if it doesn't you can always add a little bit of chicken stock to bring it there then just take that pot place it into an oven set to 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes then immediately reduce the temperature to 350 and let it cook turning occasionally to make sure all sides get browned or three to three-and-a-half hours and you'll end up with this beautifully browned juicy incredibly tender piece of meat let that cool a little bit in the bottom of the pot you have all that Moho that's separated from the fat I'll admit it looks a little bit like diarrhea but it's caramelized almost confit in the fat take all those solids out pulling out as little fat as possible place them into a bowl and you've got this sort of like caramelized Moho sauce which will use in a second and once your meat is cool enough to handle or you have asbestos hands like I do or well maybe not turn it apart so that you burn your hands a little bit because you thought it was cool but it's actually not once all your meat is shredded toss it together with all that caramelized Moho season it to taste of salt and there is your pulled pork now we're ready to assemble our sandwiches now before we assemble let's talk about our condiments first thing dill pickles get them whole and slice them yourself I don't want to see any more little circles okay I want long boy slices like this makes more sense for a sandwich let's be honest fellas first toast the inside of our bread cut a piece of your Cuban bread to a desirable length slice that bad boy in half and butter the inside with softened unsalted butter place that cut buttered side down into a cold pan set over medium heat and let that bad-boy toast now all that's toasting you're gonna need some good boiled ham and I boiled ham I mean cooked not smoked but you can also use some oak if you want add a little bit of butter in the pan just to coat the bottom set it to medium high heat and sear off at least 5 to 6 slices of good ham get some good color on both sides set it to the side keep that warm now once your bread is nice and toasted like this don't over toast it okay it's assembly time so get your two sliced toasted breads down coat them both generously with yellow mustard on the bottom slice should go on your pickles appropriately followed by your seared off ham your roasted pork shoulder and top with a generous amount of Swiss cheese now look I like to get a little bit of color on my cheese you can totally torch it just to get that melting process done get some caramelization and then top with the top of the bread now look this is the final and most important piece with more softened unsalted butter generously coat both the bottom and the top of your bread I know this seems weird place it into a cold pan set that over medium heat and then place a preheated heavy cast-iron pan on top of it emphasis on preheating the cast-iron pan make sure that it's relatively hot not ripping hot but hot and then just let that press and toast and well the bottom is nice and golden flip it place the pan back on and continue to press and see her obviously you can do this in a panini press or a plancha I didn't have one so this is the way you do it without one next thing you know boom pop you pull this thin lean mean Cuban sand out of the pan and look it's just so beautiful and that is a Cuban sandwich but of course we've got to taste it now this feels like a coupon note to me I'm pretty darn proud of it first of the sound this is lunch ed to perfection the exterior super crispy crunchy but then the insides nice and soft you have that fatty melt your mouth pork the seared ham it's salty it's piccoli it's mustardy and you've got the Swiss cheese on top to bring it all together you know some might say Josh all that effort for a sandwich yes you will not have a better sandwich in your life but do you want no one else won't have a better sandwich in its life that doesn't make sense guys and that is it so we made cubanos a gay Cuban sandwiches aka the Cuban sandwich Cubano kibana can al cabbage Anna wearing pajamas he wouldn't say which it's a very simple thing it just takes a lot of love and time and caring and hugs and kisses for the sandwich and for yourself at the end of this I gotta say despite all the time that goes into just making a sandwich hey you have a lot of leftover meat I have mine right here you can put it on rice you can put it in another sandwich you could put it in quesadillas there's so many options with the leftovers even just the final product is so rewarding once it all comes together and it's such an imperfect sandwich that that alone makes it worth it again thank you guys for the wonderful response of my merch there's still a couple items they're still available they're dwindling but if they're if there's anything you want if you're gonna want a hat or a shirt the apron is officially sold out but there's still a couple things left small quantity there will be linked in the description but with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something

once they begin to sizzle a little bit cover with a lid and begin to vigorously shake gonna do this for a couple of minutes now first it's gonna sound like nothing but then all the sudden skip like a

this and enjoy it with some crusty bread some cheese jam or however you like or just straight up into the mouth marinated olives I wanted to say marinara no fragrant garlicky citrusy baby pea longer let this marinate obviously better citrus the brightness these plump boys marinated olives they should be at every dinner party I can't believe I'm saying this but I made kale chips basically to start with 10 to 15 stalks of kale remove those nice and tender outer leaves and throw away the spine now for your spice mix you can actually give this disgusting green some flavor you're gonna mix together 2 teaspoons or four grams of kosher salt half a teaspoon of msg yes one teaspoon or two grams of porcini mushroom powder 2 teaspoons or 3 grams of serrano powder or cayenne is fine 2 teaspoons or 3 grams of garlic powder we sit together until it's nice and thoroughly combined toss your kale with one and a half tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil season generously with your spice mixture toss toss toss arrange in a single layer on a parchment lined baking sheet you're probably need to I did and place it in oven set to 250 degrees Fahrenheit for about forty minutes or until completely dry and crisp let them cool completely on a wire rack store them in an airtight container in well that's it I hate I make kale chips as I thought oh yeah I'll make something healthy for people so

really good delicious ok we're done here next up was gonna be cured cucumbers because there was one large cucumber cut it into half inch rounds season it generously with sea salt and let that sit for about 10 to 15 minutes or until it expels some water drain it if they taste you salty you can always rinse them off but I usually don't cuz I don't remember something pretty much you're gonna dress them with chili oil and soy sauce but I like to kick it up by adding a little bit my gastrique for my chicken fried steak episode a generous spoonful of Sichuan chili oil dark soy sauce to taste and by that I mean until it's salty to your taste and half a tablespoon of sesame oil mix that together please sir your bowl cover with the sauce and well you eat it oh yeah you know this might even be good with a little bit of extra hit of vinegar matter of fact a little Chinese black vinegar so satisfying it takes like literally five minutes the last thing is the simplest of them all we're gonna talk about how to enjoy fruit on another level so using pears or any stone fruit or even an apple wouldn't cheek that bad boy slice it thinly arrange it on a plate and then this is just about layering flavor first hit it with some olive oil fresh cracked black pepper flaky salt always some fresh lemon juice some finely grated aged manchego cheese it's just a small pinch of sumac on top of that - snacks oh damn if you weren't dressing your fruits like this this takes like 5 minutes to make fruit go from fruit to no fun but do you want to who else has the fruits [Music] alright guys and that is

Sounds easy enough to me... But Can we beat Panda Express? Welcome back for Episode 7. of But Better.

compete against Panda Express even for myself years ago I used to enjoy orange chicken but it's genuinely been probably I don't wanna oh I want to say like six years or so since I've had it whoa one second I've got an important announcement the merch is here boom so we got the apron made it of strong but comfortable canvas hand drawn embroidered smiley but yours truth it's got a fro kick don't we got a frock it yeah we do it's got two pockets wait no it's got three pockets this cup pockets inside pockets not to mention it's adjustable neck strap cute and efficient buttons let's not forget that we wear dad hats because it's it's cool okay I don't know got on a santoku for the cute little smiling last but not least the shirt and also let's not forget my last second change where I change slap to the word Spanky says I love you and that concludes our merch promo the link is in the description the apron that everybody's been requesting it is here so go click the link but with that said let's make this shall we this is much smaller than I anticipated you'd be smelling kind of like garlic and so we got Bluebird I asked for a small beef with broccoli on the side and they gave me this and then did not realize it would be this small ok so here is our orange chicken I actually like this box I will say it you like I've always loved takeout boxes I think there's an ad like I remember this meaning better it's not good there's no flavor or texture not crazy tell me this is not like act like kind of horrible we are gonna win okay so first we need to make our orange chicken sauce in a medium saucepan gonna combine 3/4 of a cup or 170 grams of granulated sugar 3/4 of a cup 180 milliliters of white vinegar 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon or 90 milliliters of double fermented soy sauce or you know regular I don't know if you booze you like me and 1/4 cup or 60 milliliters of water then the zest and juice of one door hinge mix all that together and then bring that up to a boil over high heat as soon as it comes to a boil reduce your heat to medium and simmer during that summer time optionally you can add a splash of sashing wine and a splash of ching-chong vinegar really threw myself under the bus with the pronunciation here then simmer for 8 to 10 minutes or until reduces about 25% then separately gonna mix together 1 tablespoon or 10 grams of cornstarch with 1 tablespoon of water until thoroughly makes knife got your slurry then we set into your hot sauce and then simmer for an additional minute or until thickened with 23 C's then immediately to that you're gonna add 4 cloves of garlic graded a 1 inch knob of ginger grated and 1/2 to red Fresno chilies finely minced now make sure that you're adding these at the end of trust me don't add them in boil away that you're gonna make the garlic go bitter you must add this at the end while it's still hot and then let it steep that's it then it's done the sauce is done it takes 15 minutes now for the fried chicken you're gonna need one and a half pounds of chicken thighs cut those into bite-size pieces about her one and a half inches thick lightly season them with salt you could also add msg if you wanted to if you want to be really fancy I chose not to do that in a medium-sized bowl combine one cup per 140 grams of cornstarch with half a cup or 75 grams of all-purpose flour whisk together until thoroughly combined and then in a separate Bowl you gonna whisk together two whole eggs do some fancy little tricks with him I guess this is splash of water whisk that together and you've got your dredge stations sent okay so to properly cut your chicken first toss a handful of pieces in the flour mixture what's there thoroughly coated shake off the excess place them in the egg mixture toss toss toss and then back into the flour mixture coating every single surface I don't want any wet spots place them to the side and rinse the repeat with the rest of your chicken pieces once all your chickens ready prepare large heavy bottomed pop filled with oil let's say oil at least three inches deep preheat the oil to 375 degrees Fahrenheit what's this nice and hot fryer chicken and badges for about three to five minutes or until light light light light light golden this won't get super dark what's it's quiz being cooked on the inside pull it out let it slightly cool in a wire wrap please so your fried chicken in a bowl drizzle with an appropriate amount of your sauce toss like you see here until everything is completely coated if it's not getting totally coated add a little more sauce keep tossing until every little crevice is coated in-house that's pretty much it you fry the chicken you coated in the sauce and well you eat it now of course optionally you can put some green onion on top maybe some fresh sliced red Fresno it's up to you come on come on obviously two very different products this is a million miles better it's salty sweet super PAC to mommy it's got really good acidity to it too you've got that punchy garlic Innes whatever you want your orange chicken and this has everything and more but one more taste of the Panda after eating that oh my god no it's not even a fair comparison we won I need you to come try this right off the bat which one you think is better that's one there's more color that's it what also looks better it looks more crispy oh it's borderline taste bad we won but better again we always win I would like to see someone who can take up the challenge billion-dollar corporations I'm just playing please don't please don't send your attorneys do you wanna know what else sends their attorneys merch aura Kaizen that is it's so pen Xpress orange chicken at home we snapped on this one I mean we really snapped this was genuinely one of the most revolutionary changes in flavor that I think we've had on this entire series making it at home taking the time to make it is genuinely far more worth it might take a little more time but man you are not gonna regret it I promise you that I'm not gonna try and convince you to make it if you don't wanna make it I don't care so with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something

us up today huh we're gonna take all this stuff and we're gonna put it in the fridge this is really hard for me to do because it's supposed to be a leftovers thing I might be a little bit ok we'll eat a little bit okay so let's start this off like we start our day with breakfast so or well maybe you don't need breakfast I don't know so we're gonna make a breakfast hash so gonna start with 2 to 3 large russet potatoes peel him cut him into bite-sized pieces add 2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters of olive oil to a large pan heat that over medium heat and then add 1 diced yellow onion saute just until translucent it's okay to get a little bit of color here and then you're gonna add your potatoes season generously with salt and pepper to taste toss that around and then cook that stirring often over medium heat for about 10 minutes if you need to speed it up you can always add a lid now next is where the leftovers come to play so I use the pork belly from Lauro but you can use any leftover protein you want cut those pieces in half I'm in a pan and fry him up until crispy and nice and brown put those to the side now once your potatoes are done and any vegetables that came with your meal as well here I added a cheese Brussels sprouts as well as their Conoco Zuzu curry which is a mushroom dish add your leftover protein of choice sir that together add a couple handfuls of spinach for a little vitamin boost and then once everything is heated through continue heating until everything's hot plate it up now this wouldn't be breakfast unless you tossed on a nice thick sunny-side up or fried egg also added their peanut romesco and some Kirsch of wonton chips just for crunch and some Korean chili flakes and that is a leftover breakfast hash hash put some sauce on it I thought of you that is very nice you know considering this is leftovers this is probably the greatest breakfast hash I've ever had in my life very very nice now for lunch I think we need to talk to say in which time first pick your bread of choice I've got a nice little sourdough loaf here for the Sando sauce are gonna need two tablespoons or 35 grams of mayo I use coupe email two tables two tablespoons are 38 grams of cognac mustard or any whole-grain mustard because you know not everyone wants be fancy and a generous amount of fresh ground black pepper mixed it together season it to taste with salt and your good toast your bread in a pan with butter not in a toaster on both sides of our medium heat until crispy like this open up your Sando spread on your mustard mayo add some thinly sliced tomato got some heirloom tomato always salt your tomatoes every sandwich please I'm begging you so sick of it as your leftover protein of choice chicken does great here I have some oak grilled bavette here I mean it's looking good and it also had some fresh herbs and pickled onions in with that dish so I went and put those on top too then I pulled some butter lettuce and some pickles from a separate to-go box see how you can kind of mix and match here hit it again with your mustard dressing and then take your top piece of bread and Crown your king then just cut that bad boy in half get your knife stuck in the board to flex and show how sharp it is that's a medium rare beef heirloom tomatoes pickles goods [Music] Oh forgot to breathe when I was doing that okay this is sandwich though I just want to add that this has been sitting out for like 20 minutes and it's cold so everybody who's like Oh Josh you let the food sit from but better that's why it's not crispy bull this has been sitting for like 20-30 minutes and just cool now for dinner we're gonna make the greatest fried rice of all time before you start in a bowl at a 1 inch piece of ginger grated 3 cloves of garlic grated 1 tablespoon or 15 grams of brown sugar one and a half tablespoons or 25 milliliters of dark soy sauce 1 tablespoon or 15 milliliters of Chinese black vinegar or rice vinegar give that a little stir and that's your fried rice juice you know that's gross next in a medium-sized nonstick skillet add 1 tbsp of oil heated over medium heat and then when nice and hot you're gonna whisk together 4 eggs add them to that pan season lightly with salt as that's going drag the cooked egg to the center bring the raw egg to the outside and rinse repeat until your eggs are totally scrambled and cooked like this in a separate large skillet add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan and heat that over a medium-high heat once that's really really hot we think that and one bunch of green onions has been cut into 1-inch segments and any leftover vegetables you have here are some snap peas from Lauro and then just let those sear stirring occasionally until they get some nice browning and caramelization place the veg to the side now let's talk about our protein here I've got some smoked brisket from Lauro I just took it out and chopped it into bite-sized pieces toss it back into that same pan and just cook it over a medium heat until it gets some nice browning and it's nice and hot crank that up to medium-high at three to five cups of leftover cooked rice it's alright if it's cold mine was along with your seared green onions and finally your fried rice juice I don't know why I keep calling it that mix a lot together and then once everything is thoroughly mixed in hot but we'll also add 1 tbsp of sesame oil you're then going to mix in your rough chopped scrambled egg taste it and adjust with salt if needed in there you go you've got fried rice brother this one is still very hot as you can see it's Texas smoked brisket fried rice I'm hungry anymore and it is not difficult for me to slam this vadi smoky brisket like come on brother I know I'm always petting myself on the back but this is easily the best fried rice I've ever eaten my life but do you want to know what else is thankful for restaurants or guys and that is it so we made a bunch of different meals on Laurel eugie and who

Because it's so good, and also really easy to make. 

Recipe: https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/chicken-pot-pie

Cast Iron Skillet I used: https://shop-l...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.387765, okay this is one of those things you either see people making from the frozen food aisle or if they do make it from home it's suck so let's make it not we're making a chicken potpie din it it holds a special place in my heart no we just did chicken fried steak with my mom oh I just spit at the camera bro it's very rare that you find someone making it from scratch I don't know why but I just never see it so with the let's set let's do this shall we okay so to start things off you'll need cooked chicken sure you can use a grocery-store rotisserie chicken but we're gonna roast our own for the Flex so to do that you're gonna take a whole chicken and then using kitchen shears you're going to remove the spine place it open spine side down make the chicken shake it's yams a little bit that's that's disrespectful press on the breast and snap the breast plate in half so you have a nice flat little chicken tuck the wings behind the head line a baking sheet with foil followed by a wire rack place your chicken on top Pat it super super super dry with paper towel coated lightly and oil give a little rub now massage season generously with salt and pepper and roasted 425 degrees Fahrenheit or 220 degrees Celsius for 30 to 45 minutes or until golden brown crispy skin and the internal temp reaches 165 Fahrenheit now before you do anything here's a little trick take all the skin off all that quiz B skin let it cool a little bit place it on a cutting board then finely chop it until you get these little crunchies like this place it in a cup set it to the side we're gonna use that later then once the chickens cool enough for you to handle if it depends on if you have asbestos hands or not remove all the meat from the chicken shred it and mix it together the bones you can say for stock for another time now making the filling for the Popeyes super easy so with a medium saucepan add 2 cups or 470 milliliters of chicken stock bringing it up to a light boil immediately shut off the heat add 1/2 a cup or 11 grams of dried morel mushrooms and 1/4 cup or 7 grams of dried chanterelle mushrooms you can use any dried mushroom you want though and also 2 bay leaves swirl it around cover them with foil and let that rehydrate for about 15 to 20 minutes don't skip this there's so much flavor involved here 1/3 hydrated remove your bay leaves squeeze out all the liquid from the mushrooms back into your broth save that broth take your ring down mushrooms rough chop your chanterelles slice your morels place those to the side in a medium sized pot just look just enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the pot bring that up over medium-high heat and then once very hot you're gonna add 3/4 of a cup or 110 grams of cubed ham use the good stuff just stir that a little bit until it gets nicely browned remove the ham from the pot reduce the temperature to medium and on five tablespoons our 70 grams of unsalted butter once that's melted in the butters bulan add two diced yellow onions 1 large carrot diced a close up garlic thinly sliced in your chopped mushrooms season that with salt and pepper give a little stir cook that just until translucent to that you're gonna add half a cup or 70 grams of all-purpose flour mix that in and keep stirring keep stirring just let that cook while stirring often for about a minute but you can add 1 cup or 235 milliliters of whole know 1 cup for 235 milliliters of heavy cream and your mushroom fortified chicken stock now bring that up over a medium heat stirring constantly and what's gonna happen is it's gonna continue to heat up and thicken and thicken with 69 C's once it reaches the appropriate thickness which should look something like this as your ham back along with 10 ounces are 280 grams of frozen peas your chopped chicken skins from earlier and of course your shredded chicken then just mix all that together until thoroughly combined and looking lovely and thick like this okay so we're ready to assemble you're first gonna need some puff pastry that's rolled out to about a quarter of an inch thin and yes I do have a video for homemade puff pastry and that's what you should be using but also I'll only judge you a little of use store-bought because I'm actually using store-bought this one don't tell anybody please I'm very sorry promise this is a rarity then transfer your filling to a 10 to 12 inch cast-iron pan drape your puff pastry on top trim the edges crimp them just a little bit brush the top with heavy cream using a sharp paring knife score cross pattern in the center pop it in your oven at 400 Fahrenheit for 20 minutes then reduce the oven temperature to 350 Fahrenheit for an additional 20 to 25 minutes and then once your pastry looks nice and golden brown crispy like this she's done then just let it rest for about 5 to 10 minutes I recommend serving this in bowls because gonna be a little bit messy and that's your pot pie so we're gonna oh right pie you don't want to burn yourself it's time for you puff pastry cream see the differences most people don't make a morel mushroom broth because we are all about : first sound test can't forget about this sound I mean it's really good it's got the classic flavor of a typical chicken pot pie but it's got this it's a pot pie a sin it's a good ass pop high if you don't make it you're losing but do you wonder what else has the crust pot pie now jeez those rough alright guys since that is its so we made chicken pot pie pie the chicken in the pot it's really just chicken pie the addition of that mushroom broth changed the game it had so much mommy to it you really get this like insane restaurant quality chicken pot pie that it's just unbeatable

Can we survive this one? Yes. Yes we can. 

Recipe: https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/taco-bel...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.387765, some say live mas others say but mas wait yeah but better Episode six let's go get him tiger [Music] okay so welcome back to but better episode six I believe the Crunchwrap supreme this has a whole lot of clout I personally actually have never had one before I don't really know what to expect out of this one but I have a good feeling that we might have the upper hand I brought before dinner with all that said let's do this shall we we've good old-fashioned Bell look at that Oh can I get two chicken Crunchwrap Supremes awesome thank you we have approximately two hours to consume and then immediately hit the restroom we got the bag five years it's very flat okay I don't expected it to be thicker like filled to the brim doesn't taste bad it tastes like a mediocre tortilla and lettuce those are the flavors that are in my mouth right now the dough starts not crunchy so that's all right there's nothing else for me to say that's look dude you're gonna make your own Crunchwrap supreme you should make your own tortillas first so with a bowl today you're gonna add two and a half cups or 360 grams of all-purpose flour one teaspoon or eight grams of baking powder two teaspoons or seven grams of kosher salt give that some whiskey business until thoroughly combined and then you're gonna add half a cup or a hundred grams of pork fat now wait I used bacon fat because duh smokey boy hours then using two forks are gonna kind of blend that together until you get nice little crumbles like this evenly dispersed of course and then you're gonna add 2/3 of a cup or 160 milliliters of hot water not boiling hot mix it all together and so you get a nice little dough knead it until completely smooth and all the dry bits are incorporated place it back in your bowl cover with plastic wrap and let that rest for 30 minutes to an hour now while that's resting we're gonna make our chicken now take a 10-inch oven-safe pan at one bunch of parsley spread out evenly two bulbs of garlic sliced in half some orange or lemon slices drizzle that with a little bit of olive oil and then I'm gonna take two skin-on bone-in chicken boobies season them generously on both sides with salt and pepper make sure that they're pat dry and then place him in a 450 degree oven for about 30 to 40 minutes or until they reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit and they're juicy and crispy okay so your tortilla dough is done resting now I'm gonna divide it into about five to six large balls generously flour work surface generously flour your balls and then roll them out as thin as they can go they should be roughly about 12 inches in diameter so another trick is to roll them a little larger in the use a bowl to then cut around and make your perfect shape heat a 12-inch cast-iron pan or a large Kamal over medium-high heat take a rolled out tortilla plop it in there you'll see a bubble up real real fast once the bottom gets some medium char flip it over let it go again for another 30 seconds or until medium char pull it off and you have a beautiful burrito size tortilla rinse repeat with all your tortillas now we need two more elements one of them being your fried tostadas this is very very simple now of course you can make your own corn tortillas you follow the directions in the back of the corn package or you mix them lies your own corn if you're an OG you flatten them out you cook them now once they've cooled down or you can use pre-made corn tortillas your thing when you drop them into 350 degree Fahrenheit oil a shallow level just enough to cover and you're gonna fry them for about 2 to 3 minutes flipping occasionally until there's very little bubbles and they look nice and quit be like this immediately pull from the oil transfer to a wire rack season them with salt while they're still hot season generously and there you go you got a tostada now instead of nacho cheese we're gonna make a spicy crema in a medium sized Bowl combine 1/2 a cup of 125 grams of sour cream 2 tablespoons or 25 grams of Mayo mayonnaise 2 tablespoons or 25 grams of jalapeno salsa this one is actually from my breakfast taco video which if you've never seen it totally fun you can use hot sauce 2 teaspoons or four grams of garlic powder one and a half teaspoons are two grams of Chipotle powder 2 teaspoons are three grams of Spanish sweet paprika the juice of one lemon and salt to taste we sit together until completely combined and you got this thick sauce stuff sick and tired of plain old iceberg lettuce ok instead we're gonna slice our iceberg lettuce super super thin place it in a bowl add half a bunch of roughly chopped cilantro and the zest of one orange toss it together you've got sort of a little herb salad and for your diced tomatoes well dice them nicely I like using heirloom tomatoes and then generously season them and let them sit in a bowl for five minutes before doing anything with them and then after that well they're ready to use so for assembly you need to start with a nice warm tortilla as the base cut your chicken into bite-size pieces add a layer the but the same size is your tostada make sure leave the skin on by the way drizzle some of your cream on top from there you can add some shredded cheese on top got a mix of aged cheddar smoked cheddar and some munch a goat cheese it's a good little combo if you want it super melted in a little bit caramelize you can totally torch it if you have a kitchen torch top with a tostada shell lightly press to it be here at a generous amount of your herb salad top that with your salty tomatoes and then drizzle generously with your spicy crema now to fold this you're gonna add a little patch of extra tortilla in the center of that then fold one side of your tortilla up over crimp and then the next piece and then and then another segment up over crimp and then repeat that process all the way around the perimeter of your tortilla until the whole thing is wrapped and they need to carefully remove this from your table top and then transfer it to a pan that set over medium heat and be careful this will come undone pretty easily if you didn't make it big enough especially and then are just gonna toast it in a pan over medium heat until it stays together and it's nice and crispy on that side flip it and repeat that process should take about 2 to 3 minutes per side I'm just doing a little visual side by side the one on the right is the taco bell's little skinny and the one on the left is mine of course thicker than a snicker relax right so where'd it taste this to the other ones we're taste testing mine let's get right into it first the sound bite okay we heard the sound bite of the other one I'll try the other one for good measure this is the talked about one ya know Obama's won we won you know we won the other day I saw meme someone posted up me saying Josh

From the world of cheap whiskey to expensive whiskey, we will explore...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.387765, it won't be getting alcohol at 11 perfect just for us just for a late night in your stomach just want to taste it all so I've been in there like do it early 10 times from last month and they're probably like the starter of the old of whiskey can be confusing and that is exactly what I want to explore a little bit of it together over the last like year and a half I've gotten really into whisky it's never been a huge thing of mine and then I just randomly decided you know what I'm gonna go all-in with in the last like few months I have accumulated quite the collection it really is genuinely for research purposes in my own perspective and everyone's like yo Josh you should talk about this well Hugh you're it's gonna be a grand old time I just spit so with all that said let's do this shall we okay so look there are many types of whiskey well just stick to a few different kinds let me talk about bourbon scotch rye whiskey and Japanese whiskey let's start off with bourbon this is an american-style whiskey it's made of at least 51% corn fun fact better cheaper wonder about $20 well or whiskey for dramatic effect I'll put it in a row tell candles give a little taste I don't know I'm doing this I can smell the Rotel it's not actually not bad what if the Rotel might actually be a good addition now for a mid tier bourbon about $50 we've got angels env2 let they have flavor come out we're gonna serve it neat which means you know we're not gonna add anything to a totally room temperature just leave it as it is as of recently one of the most favorite mid tier Bourbons on the market recommended to me by Andrew Wright binging with a light pour in most cases you don't really want to add ice and stuff like this just as a tip so it's smooth there's not too much heat this is a really great sipping whiskey for you know under like 60 bucks it's very good now in the hundred dollar bottle plus we've got the Jefferson's grand selection pshaw you ever got a frozen stainless steel ball which is literally just to keep it chilled without diluting it I personally like this one cold you know it's just my preference it will taste now we're under the most expensive choice of all this is around $120 it's not the most expensive whiskey on the market but it sits above the hundred dollar mark therefore we'll consider it an expensive bourbon Schatz Hopi shop extremely super oaky vanilla caramel most oh yeah it's so good that it makes my mouth water when I drink it excessively like I'm constantly swallowing so I can talk without being like do it this guy I feel like a guy with like one of those white toupees like a perfectly button-up collar and I just look a man like I need a cigar that's how you feel when you drink this now another American whiskey that I like is rye whiskey now in the United States it needs to be over 51% Ryan order to be called ribe and by doing that you get a spicier fruitier whiskey I only have one ride that's that's fine that's alright oh I feel like it's something similar to like a peated sort of whiskey very nice it's very sweet on the finish I'm a big fan of this now next we're gonna talk about scotch it's a mulcher green whiskey that's made in Scotland and that's well that's scotch but the way that it's made is mandated by law so that's pretty cool scotch is my least explored territory but so far this is the one I enjoy so the down work this is a 15 year aged Scotch there nice it smells good there's a reason why this is this full now last but not least I can't just not talk about Japanese whiskey one of the Japanese whiskeys that was extraordinarily coherent for how I feel right now because genuinely there are more than one camera which true there are two but I see three give that a little swirly swirly you know what I don't want to be zoomed in which I already am I have much more to deal with so it's so harsh the most harsh room yeah it's good so there are many varieties of whiskey we'll stick with these we should make some whiskey cocktails now before we make any cocktails we need to make a bartender's best friend simple syrup very very simple it's a one-to-one ratio of water and sugar so in this pot I'm putting 1 cup or 230 grams of sugar and one cup of 240 milliliters of filtered water then just bring that up over meeting me stirring often until the sugar is completely dissolved immediately cool it down and that's it that's your it's your simple syrup of course don't forget the most important part label label label store in the refrigerator for maximum shelf life and before we make the classic old-fashioned we need to discuss our cherries and not the ones you're thinking about now ferny OG cocktail the calls for maraschino cherry they're talking about this this is a look Sardo cherry if you want to be called Big Poppa you got to use this now to make the old fashioned is very simple one generous bar spoon of simple syrup about a teaspoon and a half gonna do three to four dashes of Angostura bitters or to taste two ounces of your bourbon or of choice give it a nice little stir add your ice stir once more to chill and then garnish it with an orange peel I'll kind of brush it with a little bit of a flame from a lighter squeeze it lightly you'll see that oil pop out it's like a little orange rind firedance it's nice and 1/2 to look Sardo cherries sometimes a lot a little splash of the look Sardo syrup it's totally up to you my favorite drink of all time that is that is very good Schatz hope he sholde Kentucky straight bourbon finished in bordeaux wine barrels now next up is a whiskey highball do you serve with a nice tall glass adding a good amount of ice to good ice until that you're gonna add four ounces of topo Chico or really any sparkling water or club soda obviously topo Chico is the ultimate flex 2 ounces of scotch and a nice twist of lemon peel I mean I like it but it's also not my favorite drink whoo that's yummy you like that really next up is gonna be a whiskey sour fill of a shaker a little over halfway with ice and today you're gonna add 3/4 of an ounce of fresh lemon juice I used Meyer lemon half an ounce of simple syrup two ounces of bourbon and optionally a half ounce of egg white I know it sounds gross because the thickener and it gives it that nice fluffy topping now there's shake that violently and vigorously until very very very cold shirring into a coupe glass and there you go optionally you can also add a little bit of Angostura bitters on top and try to make a little heart pattern and then realize that that didn't really work out so good so maybe don't do that next time but yeah spicy at one time I called a bartender mixologist he did not like that so so thank you very much one quick note I filmed this in two different days okay so don't think that I drink all this all at once I had to take a little break in between but do you want to know what else has to take a break because it has low tolerance to alcohol b-roll [Music] guys and that is it so we made whisky cocktails we tasted a bunch of whiskies we put it all together we don't drink enough to have a good enough tolerance to handle better and my body was like y'all had died as I've said in the last few videos I hope everyone's staying nice and safe and clean washing your hands being good people don't forget that you can text me at eight one eight four five two two six four zero yes that is my number I can text you it's a cool sort of new platform that I'm playing with content stuff that involves texting anyway with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and I will see you next time oh also did you see the thing that I put back there not well not just the not just the play button flex yeah I needed the space the equipment was getting out of control and we're running out of

The list goes on and on. For the most part, it's an extremely good southern food...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.387765, but isn't a potato eventually two things most people don't make this correctly and I don't usually have guests in here but I need the help of a true southerner who taught me how to make this mom please we're gonna show you [Music] it's a southern thing that people don't mess with it's like the whole you don't there's a tried-and-true method where did you get that from this grandmother this is like a passed down thing this is like from my grandma and my mom to me I'm ready so let's do this shall we okay so let's burn my mom's instructions you should start with four tenderize cube steaks about wasn't I wanted to have pounds total you should have your butcher do this for you build an 8x8 baking dish with enough whole milk or buttermilk to cover your cube steaks nestled them in there and let them soak at room temperature for about 15 to 20 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator that'll help tenderize and add a nice subtle flavor then you're gonna need two sleeves or 258 grams of saltine crackers pretty much the only good use for these but those brothers in a bag close the bag and make sure to push the air out unless you want a nice little cracker explosion go everywhere it's just it's not nice and then using a rolling pin coarsely crush them like that we're not looking for salting powder all right now place that into a baking dish or a shallow half hotel pan along with the unit of measurement that my mom likes to use which would be three handfuls or 255 grams of all-purpose flour because you know how Josh loves the grams not and it's not a drug thing all right stop making those jokes let's do that you're gonna add a generous amount of salt somewhere around two to three tablespoons 440 grams and a generous amount of fresh cracked black pepper mix all that together until thoroughly combined then you've got your dredge now in a deep 12-inch cast-iron skillet something like that I'm gonna fill that with the wheel until it's about 1 inch high please use oil that is suitable for frying then just heat that over medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer now in the meantime while that's heating take your meat out of the milk let it drain a little bit place it in your dredge cover it with the dredge and then firmly press you want to aggressively get this in there really make sure you get in every nook and cranny so it soaks it all up and well that's actually it there's no bread or anything else I was I was confused too but this is her thing and it works then just rinse and repeat until all of your coupe steaks are breaded and we're ready to fry now once that oil is nice and hot and shimmery I'm gonna carefully lower those bad boys dropping them away from yourself into the hot oil it needs to get a fry superfast anywhere between three to five minutes per side or until quits be golden brown give them a little flip look at the quiz B if you let them go too long they will get super dry stand I need to be medium rare but you brethren batches and as they finish place it on a baking sheet fitted with a wire rack to drip dry and rinse and repeat with the rest now once all your chicken-fried steak is actually chicken-fried we got to make our cream gravy which is a pinnacle piece now look back in the day when times were tough you might not have had the money for extra oil so if your oil isn't burnt you can pour out just enough to leave about half a cup behind you can also substitute just half a cup of butter to that 1/2 cup of oil or butter heat that over medium heat until nice and hot you're gonna add 2/3 of a cup or 100 grams of all-purpose flour give it a good mix and just mix and mix and mix know once that flour just starts to get brown about 2 minutes you're gonna stir in 1 cup or 235 milliliters of whole milk and you're just getting continue to heat that over medium heat stirring continuously until it begins to thicken now look it's going to keep thickening and thickening keep heating and thickening adding a little splash milk here and there until it reaches this consistency if it's too thick and gluey add more milk it should be nice and thick but not so thick that you can't pour it off a spoon then just season them to taste with salt and pepper and we're ready to plate up traditionally this would be served with mashed potatoes make sure to spoon a nice little trough in there for your gravy followed by your chicken-fried steak potentially some green beans if you have any hit the steak with gravy hit the mashed potatoes with gravy finish with fresh cracked black pepper and that's the darn thing brother this is like my childhood right here boy listen carefully okay just how I did it when I was a kid actually I always use the gravy boat as the dipping spot well really always I do yourself this one it is exactly like when I was a kid this is a really unique crust you have to have a Saltine [Applause] my mama would be proud she would never be proud of this now of course I think that my mom's recipe takes the cake here but I have to do my own rendition so you start with a two and a half to three pound boneless chuck roast cut that bad boy dry season and generously with salt and pepper on both sides it is six to seven quart Dutch oven two and a half tablespoons a high heat oil over medium-high heat and seared chuck roast on all sides until brown and crispy about two to three minutes each side pull it out add a little more oil in the pan turn the heat down to medium and then add one coarsely chopped yellow onion whoo celery ribs also coarsely chopped and one coarsely chopped carrot season that with salt and pepper to taste and saute just until it begins to soften then you're gonna add one 750 milliliter bottle of red wine bring that up to a simmer and once it begins to simmer you're gonna add one bundle of rosemary your chuck roast back to the pan along with its juices cover it with a lid and place it in an oven set to 325 Fahrenheit and 160 degrees Celsius for two to three hours or until super tender carefully transfer that to an 8x8 baking pan top it with the exact same size baking pan and weigh it down with cans and place it into the refrigerator to flatten and cool I would recommend at least 24 hours so it's totally flat and chilled and once that's done you can cut this into cubes or slices I actually cut this in one big sort of like thick Snickers bar shape we're gonna bread this katsu stuff so we have our three tier breading system here first you're gonna toss it in all-purpose flour then in one beaten egg faggus beaten I mean not like don't beat it up but you you don't and then finally in panko breadcrumbs aggressively pressing so it's coated all on every little crevice then you're gonna heat a medium sized pan fill with about an inch of oil just like before over medium-high heat yes exact same procedure and then gonna fry it on all sides until golden brown crispy and hot on the inside and well that's it now for the sauce instead of doing a modified cream gravy a dissenter totally change it to a spicy garlicky gastrique now this is actually a modified version from a Russian I used to work out which by the way they're doing delivery coochie-coochie-coo all these great places they please make sure to support your local restaurant sorry off my soapbox anyway in a medium sized saucepan you're gonna add 1/2 a cup per 100 grams of granulated sugar and half a cup of 120 milliliters of rice vinegar bringing it up over medium-high heat to a rapid boil and you're gonna boil that just until it reaches a surfeit consistency watch because this will over reduce and turn into a brick if you let it then let that cool slightly and then do that you're gonna add 1 to 2 Fresno chilies finely sliced 3 cloves of garlic also finely sliced the zest of one Meyer lemon and fresh ground black pepper to taste for one this stuff looks beautiful but it also tastes beautiful and I played this bad boy up I did a little carrot salad my crispy beef I'm gonna top my beef with my sweet gastrique a little bit of flaky salt cut into it and enjoy I think it looks cool but I still I know for a fact that it's not going to compare this is just so different that nice crispy coating is just delightful with that tender meat it doesn't matter my mom won okay Pizza Hut may not be able to win but my mom does alright but do you wanna know what else my mom wins Orica I my tasks alright guys and that is it broke my nose so we made it we made chicken-fried steak I broke my nose for blood sauce I think we did a pretty good job I think that my mom's method is better no matter what I do like I can always put in my own fancy ways of doing things but the original waste it's just whoo nostalgic so this is the first time that I've had a guest in my actual living quarters naturally made sense to have my mom come and do it so everybody give a nice round of applause to my mom because she deserves that she's the greatest if anybody says anything I will find you and I'll bring my bone in my foot over move all of your limbs one by one anyway we thought that said if you

It requires very little active effort, just a few simple ingredients, and ya toss it in the oven. Homemade bread has never been...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.387765, so you might be wondering why my butt's on camera right now it's for a different reason than you might think this is austin texas during rush hour and it's just looking a little bit quiet the streets are empty the bread shelves are empty it's a weird time i i get it okay so step one you want a sandwich step two you go to the store and you're like oh look at that oh very very nice came here to just get some bread and that's where i swoop in and say that i can help you with that [Music] okay so against what i would like people refer to me as the bread guy don't like that i do a lot of other things you guys know that anyway we're making a lovely sandwich loaf of bread basic necessity everybody needs it i think this is a great time for people to learn and also halfway through this video we will be having a little meme review intermission and those of you who sent in memes thank you but with all that said let's do this shall we so as with any yeast bread we need to bloom our yeast so you're gonna combine three quarters of a cup or 174 grams of water with half a cup or 125 grams of whole milk eat that so it's around 98 degrees fahrenheit or 37 degrees celsius and then mix in one tablespoon or nine grams of active dry yeast cover that lightly with plastic wrap and let that sit for 10 minutes next you're gonna combine three cups or 440 grams of bread flour one and a half teaspoons or eight grams of fine sea salt 1 tablespoon or 21 grams of granulated sugar and then just give that some whiskey business until thoroughly combined set up your stand mixer add your flour mix to the bottom of the bowl and add the spiral thingy once your yeast mixture bubbles like this it's bloomed and ready start start your mixture on start starting to make sure oh jesus start your mixer on low speed and then slowly trim in your yeast mixture until all of it's added let that mix until combined may need to scrape down the sides occasionally once you've got a cohesive dough let that keep mixing for about two to three minutes or until it starts to look nice and smooth and then you're gonna add in one tablespoon at a time three tablespoons or 42 grams of unsalted butter that has been totally softened once everything's nice and mixed and incorporated let that mix for 30 seconds more plop that thick ball out of there and then lightly shape it into a ball don't be shy now look at that dough get a little spank so smooth and voluptuous place it into a grease bowl cover it with greased plastic wrap and then just let it rise at room temperature for about one to one and a half hours or until doubled so you get it haha rise once your dough is doubled and your bowl is magically changed lightly grease a nine by four and a half inch loaf pan with butter then you need to punch your dough down lightly flour your work surface plop your d gas dough on there then using a rolling pin pull your dough into a rectangle is about a half an inch thick and wide enough to fit in your loaf pan sort of like this and then gonna tightly roll it up into a tube place it in your loaf pan and then cover it with a damp towel or another inverted loaf pan and let that rise for about 45 minutes to an hour at room temp or until doubled in size and thick like this then just take that loaf and place it in the oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit for 35 to 40 minutes or until nice and golden brown like this you don't need to brush it with anything that's that's it that's just carefully plop that thick boy out of there and let it rest on a wire rack until completely cool okay so we've got our bread right why did only one side get toasted yes sir what i like about this is it has a similar sort of like really light melt in your mouth texture it's got a different flavor okay so obviously you can use this for the typical application for example we're gonna make a grilled cheese slice your slices evenly and then here's the trick for even browning take softened butter and spread it all over edge to edge on one side of a piece of bread place it in your cold pan bring it up over medium heat place your cheese of choice on top add a mix of cheddar cheese and monterey jack place the other butter sliced on top butter being exposed toast until crispy on one side flip it repeat the process the cheese should be melty and there you go that's a grilled cheese pretty you don't even show you how to do that listen to this it's so crispy and yet so delicate it like melts in your mouth with the cheese and come on now the last example is going to be the way that i like to make blt as for the b ak the bacon i personally like to cook my bacon in the oven line it on a sheet tray put it in a cold oven set the oven to 425 fahrenheit and let it sit there for anywhere between 20 to 30 minutes or until quit be and that's it for the bread you're going to want to toast it on both sides with butter both sides then go ahead and slice your tomatoes and make sure to always salt your tomatoes any application for a sandwich moving forward for the rest of your life please salt your tomatoes thank you so much i also added some pepper and some lemon zest because fancy now to assemble the sandwich it's very very very simple now you can put mayo actually use burger sauce from the in and out video add a generous amount of your quiff be bacon or not crispy it's okay if you like it floppy that's fine your lettuce of choice i use green leaf lettuce and then your tomatoes which better have been salted your top slice of toast cut it in half and unveil a gorgeous cross section that you're ready to place directly in your mouth bacon lettuce tomato one of my mom's very favorite sandwiches [Music] this is how every blt on the planet should be and i'm not just saying that to be there's a word for this extra bonus round it is time for food it is time for a food meme review i asked you guys to send me food memes onto my subreddit and you did it and now we're gonna look at him as an absolute consider this little intermission let us begin this cheese cheese clog oh god why are we already starting like this where the

Visit http://pork.org/cooking to learn more.

First we're gonna break down a pork loin, then we are going to cook those pieces many ways....",2022-12-03 21:59:44.387765, to this somebody might say josh there's no way you can take one piece of meat and then turn it into five different cuts and do a bajillion different things with it oh that's what you think okay and that is why today's video was sponsored by the national pork board the ceo of pork but to make it short uh yeah it exists [Music] so [Music] okay so we're going to be working with pork loin a whole pork loin of the most economical useful most versatile cuts of meat on the whole planet mine bottled not even boggled i'm having an add moment um what was i talking about so with all that said uh let's make this shall we the italians are going to be very angry at me now wait just one second you know how much i love pork expected pork is relatively affordable it stores well it cooks easily we all know that stuff but given how life might be for the next couple months let's talk about the most important thing you got this okay i don't need no help so now that we're all probably cooking a little bit more we also want to eat things that are easy to make but also as healthy as possible like this this is packed full of lean heart healthy protein that helps me maintain my thick physique not to mention a three ounce serving of pork is an excellent source of thymine selenium protein niacin vitamin b6 phosphorus uh riboflavin um uh uh zinc patel potassium all a lot of things anyway on to the video okay so first let's take a quick look at a whole porcelain i don't really know what's going on here but this is what it looks like it's a big thick long boy okay so if we take a look at the fat lines here you can actually really distinctly tell what part is what that part on the right that you see that's sort of the head that's where the sirloin roast is and then that part of the back is where the rib roast is everything in the middle basically can be cut into chops and that's basically what we're gonna do okay so first let's remove the sirloin roast you need to find where that fat line sort of branches out right there take a nice sharp knife and then just cut straight down from there and there's a nice little centerline roast next that's the same thing with that left third you need to find that fat line place your knife on nice and sharp and slice normally you don't find this in a roast form it's usually cut into something called country ribs now with our center cut third that's we're gonna get our choppy boys now the beauty of this part is you can cut these bad boys as thick as you want thicker means it's gonna be easier to make it juicy so i usually go about one and a half inches thick and just like that you've got a bunch of thick with 25 c's pork chops okay the last one i want to talk about is the rib roast which was the part on the left normally you'll see something called country ribs which is literally just this cut into well like one to one and a half inch slices and that's yeah that's country ribs right there let's first start with the sirloin roast so we're gonna stuff this bad boy we need to unroll it just like a book so you're gonna take a nice long sharp knife that cap side down and then just start slicing about a half an inch above where that fat cap's touching the board and then begin to open it up as you're slicing so you get one nice long piece of meat so you're sort of unraveling it like so this wasn't my best unrolling not gonna lie it's pretty depressing attempt but normally it's better i promise now to make this stuffing you're gonna need three cloves of garlic finely chopped one poblano pepper finely chopped i'll go ahead and chop in the zest of one lemon for some freshness half a bunch of parsley leaves finely chopped and two to three green onions finely chopped season that generously with salt a little bit of black pepper and a quarter cup or 60 milliliters of olive oil just so you create a nice little paste here rub it all over the inside of your unrolled pork roast go ahead and use all of it it's okay if a little bit spills out and then roll it all up notice how it's spilling out a little bit sorry that'll happen then at four evenly spaced intervals you're gonna tie off the roast with kitchen twine so it looks like this and uh do me a little favor and clean off those little danglies all right clean up your work surface clean up your roast make stuff clean all right dirty workspace dirty mind whatever falls out of the roast i actually like to rub the whole roast with then just place it on a foil lined baking sheet with a wire rack season it generously with salt and pepper then place it in an oven that's been preheated to 450 degrees fahrenheit for 15 minutes then lower the oven immediately to 325 fahrenheit and roast for an additional 45 to 60 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees fahrenheit which is essentially perfectly cooked then just let that bad boy rest for at least 15 minutes and slice into it and experience the juice rolled up it's got some flavor in it moist you can eat this with like some steamed rice or whatever and have a healthy little meal next up is gonna be pork chops now you can totally brine these but i actually like to just go ahead and season them really generously with salt and pepper and let them sit in the fridge overnight to soak up that salad heat a medium-sized skillet over medium-high heat with about two and a half tablespoons of oil in there once it's ripping hot go ahead and add your pork chops always lay away from you don't splash on yourself all right then just stir for about three minutes on both sides until nice and browned and then here's the secret you're thinking add a couple cloves of garlic that have just been lightly crushed you can leave them in the skin toss them in the pan add a nice healthy chunk of butter in there and then baste generously you want to put a lot of butter you see how much butter is in there and then baste that continuously until it reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees fahrenheit then let it rest for five minutes and then slice into it and notice how moisturized that is that is juicy that is moist that is succulent poke chop no sous vide no special technique just sear and baste at the proper temperature of cooking and you can cook a beautiful piece of pork without any fancy gimmicky blah blah blah look at this look at this what do you think that i'm gonna say now another way you could cook these pork chops is actually just to make a katsu style which is basically where you're gonna pound it out a little thinner and then you're gonna bread it i actually have a chicken katsu recipe that you literally can use the exact same recipe and just replace the chicken breast with these that's it you fry it in a little bit of shallow oil until it's nice and crispy slice that brother up you put it in the sandwich and then you can top it with whatever you want toss on some koopie mail maybe some sweet gochujang sauce or whatever you're feeling really good but this just makes me want it to be a sandwich really that's grandchi the ceo stupid jokes this is so filling i was pretty much done eating before i even got to this last but not least is our country ribs now typically i would suggest grilling them and then glazing them with whatever type of glaze you want don't have a grill right now but i will soon you can totally sear them and glaze them look at that just chew them the exact same way you did the other pork chops but instead of basting with butter you're gonna baste them with whatever glaze you have on hand the glaze that i made was really simple it was one and a half tablespoons of gochujang paste three tablespoons of honey one tablespoon of dark soy sauce and two teaspoons of black vinegar then just give it a little stir a little whiskey whisk until smooth and that's your glaze brother also if you're not doing them on the grill i would recommend boiling them so they get glazed like this so uh if you ain't never had a country rib you ain't never you ain't never lived under respected cut of pork in my honest opinion obviously this would be better if it was grilled all right very yummy thank you very much but do you want to know what else is very yummy and says thank you very much b-roll [Music] now before we end this video i just want to quickly say thank you so much to the national pork board for sponsoring this video we appreciate you all right guys and that is it so we broke down a whole pork loin we seared we fried we roasted well we fake grilled if you have a grill then use the dang grill how is it what's the confusion there we're living in a really interesting time the reason why i say that is because now we have all these people who've never cooked before that all of a sudden are cooking i'm stoked about it genuinely i'm ecstatic i really think this could be a revolutionary change for the whole planet people who don't cook or people who haven't cooked in forever are coming back to it it's such a cathartic thing to do and i know people are stressed it's just it's a beautiful thing man so without getting too sappy about it uh i'm i'm kind of happy about about that aspect of you know aside from the negatives of course but um but yeah with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and i will see you next time [Music] you

We pulled out all the stops with homemade buns, the best burger sauce, griddled...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.387765, it couldn't a time in everyone's life or you must face a foe that you thought was once you were in and out I truly hate to do it to him we gonna do it okay so we're gonna recreate the in-n-out burger at home as best we can in and out something that's special to me right I grew up with it I grew up in I really believe that's that same motorcyclist I'm gonna red light just chillin oh how are you doing oh the lights green is that really necessary anyway let's do this shall we like I thought that we were gonna not see people out and about and yet we see all these people running and then we'll another double-double with cheese animal style fries you got the bag this is a tough one for me I'm from California so I also could not resist the temptation of getting animal style fries their presentation is undefeated take the bag off you eat from this bag don't the spin in and out rule from LA that I just made up I want to see something this is a good burger but can we make it better yes you guys know I'm making my own buns so you start with 1/2 a cup 120 grams of whole milk around 98 degrees Fahrenheit and you're gonna mix in 1 tablespoon or 9 grams of instant yeast let that sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes now starting with 2 and a quarter cup or 320 grams of bread flour which could be considered a precious metal right now you're gonna add 1 teaspoon or 7 grams of fine sea salt and 2 tablespoons or 20 grams of granulated sugar pull out your whisk drop it on the floor and then even some whiskey bise's until thoroughly combined trace or the juice stand mixer with the dough spiral thingy attached next we're gonna make a quick little roux in a small pot come on 2 tablespoons or 20 grams of bread flour and 6 tablespoons or 87 grams of water then just whisk that together and then begin mixing over medium heat until super thick like this then just put it aside and let it cool to room temperature with your mixer running on low add your yeast e milky mix you'll that's gross sorry followed by one egg plus one egg yolk then you're cooled thicky flour mixture now look the snow starts up pretty sticky so you're gonna wanna let your mixture mix that for about two to five minutes or until everything's looking nice and smooth yeah add two tablespoons or 28 grams of unsalted softened butter 1 tablespoon at a time then just let that mix for another 2 to 3 minutes until thoroughly incorporated and smooth spray medium sized bowl with oil shape you're doing to a light ball plop it into your bowl lightly grease some plastic wrap place it on top and let it rise about one and a half to two hours or until doubled now once your dough is gone thick go mode give it a nice little kiss and then punch that big once you've degassed it dump it onto a lightly floured work surface and divide it into six even pieces each piece weighing about 95 to 105 grams to shape these you're gonna take the bottom fold those pieces over itself flip it over so those seem set is down and then roll it around on a none floured work surface with your fingers constantly in contact with the board until it tightens up into a nice ball and repeat with the rest puts them all on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and once you have your buns lightly cover your baking sheets with either a damp towel or another baking sheet inverted on top and let this proof for 45 minutes to an hour in a warm area lightly push all your buns with egg wash consisting of one egg plus a splash of water then I bake these at 375 Fahrenheit convection but you could probably go ahead and just do 400 if you want about 15 to 17 minutes 1/2 - 150 whose policy then just immediately brush all those plump boys with melted butter and let him cool obviously these are an iteration from my already burger bun recipe before we make our burgers we need to make the Covenant in an out burger sauce start by dicing two whole onions add two tablespoons or 28 grams of unsalted butter to a small saucepan bringing it up to heat over medium heat what's the butters melted in bubbling add your onions along with a small pinch of sugar and some salt and then just let that cook over medium heat for about 30 minutes stirring occasionally adding water if it pan gets too dry or it's burning until nice and deeply caramelized like this I know it takes time but you can't rush it and obviously you can do this while you're waiting for your dough to rise now in a medium-sized bowl you're gonna add 3/4 of a cup 180 grams of mayonnaise 1/2 a cup or a hundred and thirty grams of ketchup 1/3 a cup or 15 grams of finely sliced chives 2 tablespoons or 27 grams of worth testers just shower just a sauce damn it add a small pinch of salt and whisk all that together until thoroughly combined then you're gonna add 2 finely diced dill pickles assuming they're not gigantic and then your caramelized onions and then mix all those together and you've got the most incredible burger sauce of your life I mean really I was shocked tasting this it's it's nuts ok so now we're ready for the components of our burger if you're gonna have onions on the burger - in and out usually griddles they're onions before they put it on so I got to do is cut your onions about a half an inch thick into rings like this leave them put together get the pan and coat it with oil heat it over medium high heat and then sear them on both sides until he gets a nice caramelized color like this if you want to go a little farther you can also add some butter and basted them in that okay so now we need to talk about our meat patty so you're gonna need one pound or 450 grams of ground beef this is about 80% fat divide that into four pieces and then roll them into balls next heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until ripping hot rush it with a high heat oil add one of your balls and then press it down with a spatula and tell us about four inches in diameter it should be nice and flat then just season that with salt let that sear for about two to three minutes or until nice and quitz be caramelized on the bottom look at that flip it over season again with salt and then here's the thing you can do this totally optionally but I really recommend it add in two cloves of lightly crushed garlic left in its skin a bunch of thyme and a couple of tablespoons of butter and then just base that until the other side is nicely seared now if you're gonna have cheese on these which I would highly recommend add a slice of cheddar cheese on one patty a slice of Muenster or Monterey Jack on the other now there's a couple ways you can melt the cheese you can always just let it cook until it melts or you can add a splash of water or you could do this place your grilled onion on top of the bottom Patty and the top patty on top of that patty so we're finally ready to assemble slice your buns in half set a pan over medium heat toss in 1 tablespoon of butter once they're melted and bubbling add your buns and toast for a couple of minutes or until nice and golden brown like this always toast your buns you are not allowed to eat a burger unless they are toasted okay here we go burger assembly we have to be serious here okay focus so you can add a heaping tablespoon of your sauce on both buns that are toasted for the more sauce the merrier you can never really have too much of this good sauce spread it out evenly let Lee salt 1/2 inch slice of tomato on both sides and then place it on your bottom bun followed by a hearty piece of iceberg lettuce carefully and gently lower on your burger patties and then finally crown your king with the top of your bun okay da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da little did need to delete that delete that the dog didn't delete the deleted they did all right we're done with that that's enough did it except this is a little tall I'm a feeling that I'm not gonna be able to fool my mom she jumped me it's an orb of light meds it's taking shape to me oh well I lost it but oh so comparatively here we've got the in-and-out wheat this one again the height of this burger makes the most sense for sure well maybe it's not even comparable comparable comparable making these buns change the game we still won cuz this is still a great burger I'm not gonna lie in and out my heart goes out to them like rest in peace but but you lose to a burger that's too tall if you disagree then please let me know comment I guess it put a long story short my as quality you can taste I'm a big fan of in and out really and respect to everybody in the game right do you want to know what else respects everybody in the game be [Music] [Applause] alright guys and that is it so we made it in and out bubbles these triggers however you like to say it doesn't matter honestly head to head it was a pretty close call in my opinion with that said I think I really think in and out does a good burger it's really hard for me to say that this is a win in and out thank you for being good support even though the literally nonsense participating in this but nonetheless with all that said if you enjoyed this video or you learned something leave a like subscribe and I will see you next time [Music] [Applause] [Music]

Naturally we gotta make it homemade. Oh and by the way, it's easier than...",2022-12-03 21:59:44.387765, spicy food doesn't kill me immediately oh I don't know why do we didn't get so I've never been to Nashville before everybody it's like really nice start to an iconic Nashville dish Josh really nice how about this we'll go there and then then we'll make it sound good okay [Music] [Music] we're in Nashville what is that and if government with some sort of like futuristic Cyclops mask we're gonna let's just see how a however so we decided to start this all up at one of the most iconic Nashville hot chicken places in the world and then I realized that they were closed so I'm very sorry that's the end of the video thank you so much for know we're gonna go we're gonna get going next to the list is another icon Hattie B's couldn't exactly film inside and we were getting a lot of weird look so we decided to go ahead and just grab our chicken and go yeah it smells great I mean I'm I'm pretty stoked about it this wow that actually looks pretty ballin I will say there's one medium in here there's one hot and then there's one ultra hot that's probably the ultra hot one is that that seemed right when I start here that's a really good these are just tenders right this is medium super juicy natural just a chicken right this is what I'm imagining the hot looks like it really good right so how it is cleanse this that's that's hot this is extra hot you know what I'll just do over the thingy I'm gonna start tongue down this is the first stop we haven't even gotten started yet this is down first time oh there's a water come what is this is this [Music] well that doesn't work so [Music] I didn't think about it at all no it's all good okay I did this for you no don't let this flop how do you smile see really good it's crispy it's salty button the spikes he's actually not that bad now the extra hot medium is like okay that's a little spicy spicy is like it's a little spicier and then when you go to X naught it just goes you so just to get a better idea I decided to visit two more places you know for science the next one being at least barbecue I know what you're thinking barbecue what is that sis Nashville every single restaurant isms mandatory I serve hot chicken oh wow my body needs a break and this is the break that I needed it's like a loving hug from your mom I think we need to try one more and we'll be there despite the fact that the original princess was closed in the beginning we had to see if there was one of them that was open but the reason why all these restaurants are so messed up right now is because the tornado that went through Nashville there are a lot of relief funds and if you want to donate they really need the help there'll be a link in the description so if you'd like to help you can go there cheers to you and this is the hot version but they put this on top of a slice of bread this is where the flavor is all the like salty heavily spiced flavor it's all condensed this little snow piece of bread obviously insane I think we're in a good spot to go back home inevitably recreate the hot chicken okay so thanks to movie magic we're back in town I wish that it was like glazed with some sort of like sweet whatever cuz it's shiny and like red it's not so stop assuming the secret is the oil by the way you can text me at eight one eight four five two two six four zero its new sort of content thing I'm trying out but anyway with all that said let's do this shall we sure that's all the comics are saying the recipe starts at four minutes just so you know okay so let's first adjust our chicken as you can see I'm firmly addressing mine in all seriousness we've got to keep this classic okay I don't want to see me just plain old chicken breasts you can do four chicken leg quarters or you can just do a whole chicken that's been cut into eight pieces of course you can have your butcher do this I personally like to do this myself because it's you know got a keep in practice bra the point is the chicken needs to have skin and ideally a bone now the next thing is instead of brining our chicken we're actually just gonna give it a light cure so season all of your chicken on both sides pretty generously with salt if you want to get real fancy you can add a little bit of MSG you know mizune then just let that sit in the fridge for 24 hours of course you can skip that part but it makes a big flavor difference now when you're ready to fry fill a medium-sized have you bottom pot with oil you need enough to submerge the chicken but not overflowing cause a grease fire please be careful then go ahead and preheat that birther to 325 Fahrenheit or 160 degrees Celsius now we're gonna make our dip and rage so to make the buttermilk dip you're gonna need two large eggs whisked together then whisk in two cups or 475 milliliters of buttermilk then whisk in two tablespoons or 30 milliliters of hot sauce I use Louisiana two tablespoons or 30 milliliters of pickle juice optionally and an optional splash of cold smoked matsutake show you for fancy now for the flower church all you need is three cups our 450 grams of all-purpose flour and three teaspoons or 10 grams of kosher salt if that some whiskey business slop that boy around till everything's nice and incorporated okay so we've got our dip and dredge what we need to do one more thing we got to mix our spices for the welt spicy oil so you gonna start with a quarter cup or 25 grams of cayenne powder yes it's hot chicken not mild chicken it's a six and a half out of ten on the spicy scale add that to a medium-sized bowl along with one tablespoon or 11 grams of garlic powder 1 tablespoon or 8 grams of smoked paprika or you can use regular paprika 2 teaspoons or six grams of kosher salt and 2 tablespoons or 25 grams of dark brown sugar give that a little whiskey Judah that was a weird that's weird until thoroughly combined okay breading good chicken is an art to do this first toss a piece of chicken in the flour make sure to thoroughly coated shaking off the excess then dunk it in your buttermilk mixture thoroughly coat make sure there's no flowery patches and then back in your flour make sure pressing aggressively to get that coating all over the chicken you want to get every little nook and cranny it should look something like this now as you do it all get flakier and flakier because you have little clumps in there and that's great rents are people with all pieces of chicken gold that's it and now you're ready to eat I like it medium rare bone Apple tea that's a joke that's a joke please dear God nobody actually do that once your chicken is spreaded in your oil is at 325 Fahrenheit or 160 degrees Celsius you can go ahead and drop your chicken in in batches make sure not to overfill this I did like two to three pieces of chicken at a time and every time you fry you're gonna fry for 15 to 18 minutes or until the internal temperature reads 165 degrees Fahrenheit and if it's browning too fast just turn the temp down and touch anyway once your chickens down are nice and golden quiz B transfer to a baking sheet with a wire rack attached to it so can drain and then just repeat with the rest of the chicken we need to take another look at that chicken [Music] now once your chickens done take one cup or 240 milliliters of your hot fry oil and whisk that into your spices they might bubble a little bit that's totally okay once everything's nice and thoroughly mixed immediately toss all of your chicken in the hot oil the oil must be hot so the chicken stays quiff beat of course you can also brush this on but come on let's let's let's be real here also should mention it's a good idea to have some good white bread on you even better if you've made it yourself and you can slice it anything yes you want then gently lay your chicken on to a piece of bread that's some pickles and enjoy you know I gotta say this I'm really excited about this this looks really good pretty much the same - the fact that I added some smoked paprika my mouth is watering is whenever I said that I was like smoke back ikonics Oprah with that spicy boy oil I don't even know what to say eating this is like going into a wispy dreamy State this is pretty damn close I mean what do you want me to say I think we freaking did it [Music] that is a goodness so we get it the chickens good try the bread here it is whoo Nashville anyway Nashville I hope I made you proud hugs and kisses but do you want to know what else gets hugs and kisses b-roll [Music] [Music] we're guys and that is it so we made hot chicken it's hot but not too hot I tried to keep the spice level rather medium high ish but it should be spicy if you're gonna make hot chicken make it as spicy as you can tolerate it's called hot chicken okay come on come on let's I mean it's like right over here so it's hard for me no I gotta be honest with you guys the merch store is live you can purchase now but I'm not gonna release it I'm not gonna say anything about it because just to be completely honest given the circumstances of everything everybody's all stressed out about this stuff going on I'm not gonna say what it is you know what I'm talking about and I just don't feel like asking people to pull out their wallets quite yet you know I just want to wait a little bit wait for things to kind of mellow out a little I'm just trying to be respectful to everybody involved and yeah so you know if you guys feel differently better than you want you're like totally cool just comment let me know communicate it with you guys and not because I know that it's it's always me being like it's coming it's coming in now that it's finally here now I'm like I know release with all that said if you

the pistachios and the goat cheese in the olive oil and a blingy salt in the part in the onion and the garlic and the butter but other than that it's pretty much a canned good meal so hey I might never use fresh food again that's never gonna happen and nobody would have any idea that at least half of it is canned goods okay on to the next next we're gonna make the Chinese rice porridge known as congee it's very very easy to get sir with 3/4 of a cup or 170 grams of white rice preferably sushi rice you've got a good little rinse you gonna place it in a medium sized sauce pot into that you're gonna add 6 cups or one and a half liters of chicken stock or dashi or a mix of two I really wouldn't recommend water because it's gonna be really boring flavor so yeah chicken really any any chicken or beef stock is fine so that over medium heat and bring it to a light simmer and then simmer that for about one to one and a half hours stirring every 15 minutes until the rice begins to break its thicken and it's sort of got a texture looking like this ladle the hot conjugant ooh a bowl top with whatever you want but I would recommend some thinly sliced green onions some chili oil maybe a little bit of sesame oil she's gonna taste with soy sauce or dark soy some fresh chopped garlic you can also add roasted meats the list goes on and on now this this is something special right here when he's targeted she goes elite cook we used to eat this all the time for breakfast in the morning would come in our executive pastry chef would make this first for breakfast because she's so kind Ariana if you're watching it smells mind-boggling mind-boggling if you will I mean wow see the thing I like about this is you can kind of dress it up however you want staple food it stretches a dollar man healthy with a soft-boiled egg in here would be next one last we're gonna make some bacony beans in a large skillet you're gonna add half a pound or 230 grams of bacon sir cooking that over medium heat until it starts to get low crispy and releases a bunch of fat then you're gonna add two diced poblano peppers or any pepper that you can find and five cloves of thinly sliced garlic season that to taste with salt stir that and saute until that begins to soften we're gonna add one can of pinto beans adjust the salt levels as needed continue to cook until the beans are nice and hot and that well actually that's it you just pour that and you can put that on anything to put that on rice put it with some potatoes actually put that on a tortilla and just topped it with avocado some Manchego cheese on top you know you could do whatever you want with this stuff it's a great accompaniment or can be a entire entree on its own good sound ten hundred ten mm Wow salty and bacony and garlic Hume that's real good right I just ate this whole thing and didn't say and that alone is all I need to say beaten later but do you wanna know what else has been in its hair or Tizen that is it so we made a bunch of things that were made from canned goods things that were fresh sort of like a nice little mix of everything and of course the classic toilet paper boil it that's very important these days mmm except of that after Andrew thank you for the recommendation angels Envy I've already said it before I don't want to rush on it too much just you know be safe be happy guys just for obvious reasons I haven't released merged purposefully the website is live it's ready to sell I'm ready to sell I really want to release it now I just want to wait a little bit before we do that to be respectful but in the meantime I want to wait till things just kind of chill out a little and until then I know things can be a little scary behave I hope everyone is safe happy chillin drinking a nice glass little drink a nice glass of bourbon or whatever your drink of choice is if you're of age and yeah if you enjoyed this video or you learn something to leave a like subscribe and I will see you next time [Music] [Music]
